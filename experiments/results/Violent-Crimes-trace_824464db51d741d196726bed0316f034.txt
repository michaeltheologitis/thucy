Claim to verify: “The number of violent crimes decreased in Seattle between 2024 and 2023.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows a slight increase in violent crimes from 2023 to 2024, not a decrease.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “Seattle”, schema public, table public.crime_data.

Schema overview (public.crime_data)
- Key columns used:
  - report_datetime (timestamp): reporting timestamp
  - offense_date (timestamp): offense occurrence timestamp
  - offense_category (text): includes value “VIOLENT CRIME”
  - offense_sub_category (text): subtypes (e.g., AGGRAVATED ASSAULT, ROBBERY, RAPE, HOMICIDE)
- No schema-level enumerations; categories observed from data.

Definition used
- Violent crime defined as rows where offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'. This aligns with the dataset’s own categorization and captures UCR-violent offenses (e.g., aggravated assault, robbery, rape, homicide).
- Primary time basis: report_datetime year. A cross-check using offense_date year is also provided.

Evidence
1) Date coverage check
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(report_datetime) AS min_report_datetime, MAX(report_datetime) AS max_report_datetime, MIN(offense_date) AS min_offense_date, MAX(offense_date) AS max_offense_date FROM public.crime_data;
Result:
- min_report_datetime: 1975-12-16 15:00:00+00
- max_report_datetime: 2025-10-27 23:04:15+00
- min_offense_date: 1900-01-01 00:00:00+00
- max_offense_date: 2025-10-27 20:07:00+00
Interpretation: Dataset contains full-year coverage for both 2023 and 2024.

2) Yearly violent crime counts by report_datetime (primary measure)
SQL executed:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM report_datetime)::int AS year, COUNT(*) AS violent_count FROM public.crime_data WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM report_datetime) BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025 GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2023: 5,458
- 2024: 5,515
(Additional years returned: 2020: 4,588; 2021: 5,532; 2022: 5,745; 2025: 4,237)
Interpretation: Violent crimes increased from 5,458 (2023) to 5,515 (2024).

3) Breakdown by violent sub-category (report_datetime basis)
SQL executed:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM report_datetime)::int AS year, offense_sub_category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.crime_data WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM report_datetime) IN (2023,2024) GROUP BY year, offense_sub_category ORDER BY year, count DESC;
Results:
- 2023: AGGRAVATED ASSAULT 3,327; ROBBERY 1,701; RAPE 365; HOMICIDE 65 (Sum = 5,458)
- 2024: AGGRAVATED ASSAULT 3,323; ROBBERY 1,713; RAPE 426; HOMICIDE 53 (Sum = 5,515)
Interpretation: Small shifts by subtype; aggregate rose by 57 incidents.

4) Cross-check using offense_date (occurrence date)
SQL executed:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year, COUNT(*) AS violent_count FROM public.crime_data WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME' AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date) BETWEEN 2020 AND 2025 GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2023: 5,435
- 2024: 5,477
(Additional years returned: 2020: 4,558; 2021: 5,513; 2022: 5,741; 2025: 4,142)
Interpretation: Using offense occurrence date also shows an increase from 2023 to 2024.

Verdict rationale
- Both the reporting-date and occurrence-date measures show a higher count in 2024 than in 2023. Therefore, the claim that violent crimes decreased from 2023 to 2024 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The dataset reflects Seattle incidents; no separate “city” filter exists and the database is scoped to Seattle.
- Violent crimes are defined by offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME', using the dataset’s own classification consistent with UCR categories.
- The primary comparison uses report_datetime; results are corroborated with offense_date to ensure consistency.
- Full-year coverage for 2023 and 2024 is assumed based on the dataset’s date range extending through late 2025.
