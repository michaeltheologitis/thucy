Claim to verify
“2024 saw a reduction in property crime and violent crime in Seattle.”

How I interpreted the claim
- Reduction is interpreted as a year-over-year decrease from 2023 to 2024 in Seattle-wide totals.
- “Property crime” and “violent crime” are mapped to the offense_category values 'PROPERTY CRIME' and 'VIOLENT CRIME' in the Seattle crime dataset.

Data sources explored
- Database: Seattle (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.crime_data (key fields: offense_date, offense_category, nibrs_crime_against_category)

Evidence
1) Year- and category-level counts (PROPERTY CRIME and VIOLENT CRIME in 2023–2024)
SQL executed:
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year,
  offense_category,
  COUNT(*) AS incident_count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE offense_category IN ('PROPERTY CRIME','VIOLENT CRIME')
  AND offense_date >= '2023-01-01'::date
  AND offense_date < '2025-01-01'::date
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1, 2;
Results:
- 2023 — PROPERTY CRIME: 40,951; VIOLENT CRIME: 5,435
- 2024 — PROPERTY CRIME: 41,220; VIOLENT CRIME: 5,477

2) Subtotals by year (PROPERTY + VIOLENT combined)
SQL executed:
SELECT
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year,
  COUNT(*) AS incident_count_subtotal
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE offense_category IN ('PROPERTY CRIME','VIOLENT CRIME')
  AND offense_date >= '2023-01-01'::date
  AND offense_date < '2025-01-01'::date
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
Results:
- 2023 — subtotal: 46,386
- 2024 — subtotal: 46,697

Findings
- Property crime increased from 40,951 (2023) to 41,220 (2024), a rise of 269 incidents (~0.7%).
- Violent crime increased from 5,435 (2023) to 5,477 (2024), a rise of 42 incidents (~0.8%).
- Combined, these categories increased by 311 incidents from 2023 to 2024.

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data: both property crime and violent crime were slightly higher in 2024 than in 2023 in the Seattle dataset examined.

Assumptions and notes
- “Reduction” interpreted as a year-over-year decrease from 2023 to 2024.
- Used offense_date for annual assignment and offense_category for mapping to “PROPERTY CRIME” and “VIOLENT CRIME.”
- The dataset covers Seattle city incidents recorded in public.crime_data.
