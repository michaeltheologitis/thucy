Claim to verify
“Between June and August 2025, officials reported that violent crime incidents in downtown Seattle dropped by 36% compared to the same period in 2024.”

What data I checked
- Verified the available data source and its structure (Seattle database, public.crime_data table).
- Used the table’s built-in category offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME' to quantify violent crime.
- Measured June–August windows using offense_date by default, and cross-checked with report_datetime.
- Interpreted “downtown Seattle” using neighborhoods present in the data: BELLTOWN, DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL, PIONEER SQUARE. I also tested an expanded downtown area including CHINATOWN/INTERNATIONAL DISTRICT.

Key findings (summary)
- Combined “downtown” (Belltown + Downtown Commercial + Pioneer Square): Violent crime incidents increased by about 14.6% in Jun–Aug 2025 vs Jun–Aug 2024 (192 → 220 incidents).
- Downtown Commercial only: small decrease of about 6.3% (112 → 105 incidents).
- Expanded downtown (adding Chinatown/International District): small increase of about 4.4% (274 → 286 incidents).
- Citywide: small decrease of about 2.7% (1,488 → 1,448 incidents).
- No plausible downtown grouping tested shows a ~36% drop in overall violent crime incidents.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) List columns in public.crime_data (to confirm relevant fields exist)
SQL:
SELECT 
  a.attnum AS ordinal_position,
  a.attname AS column_name,
  pg_catalog.format_type(a.atttypid, a.atttypmod) AS data_type,
  CASE WHEN a.attnotnull THEN 'NO' ELSE 'YES' END AS is_nullable,
  pg_get_expr(ad.adbin, ad.adrelid) AS column_default,
  col_description(a.attrelid, a.attnum) AS column_comment
FROM pg_attribute a
JOIN pg_class c ON a.attrelid = c.oid
JOIN pg_namespace n ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
LEFT JOIN pg_attrdef ad ON ad.adrelid = a.attrelid AND ad.adnum = a.attnum
WHERE c.relname = 'crime_data'
  AND n.nspname = 'public'
  AND a.attnum > 0
  AND NOT a.attisdropped
ORDER BY a.attnum;
Result excerpt (columns available): report_datetime (timestamp), offense_date (timestamp), offense_category (text), offense_sub_category (text), nibrs_* fields, neighborhood (text), etc.

2) Distinct neighborhoods corresponding to downtown
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT neighborhood
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE neighborhood IS NOT NULL AND (
  neighborhood ILIKE '%downtown%'
  OR (neighborhood ILIKE '%pioneer%' AND neighborhood ILIKE '%square%')
  OR neighborhood ILIKE '%pioneer sq%'
  OR neighborhood ILIKE '%belltown%'
  OR (neighborhood ILIKE '%denny%' AND neighborhood ILIKE '%triangle%')
  OR (neighborhood ILIKE '%denny%' AND neighborhood ILIKE '%regrade%')
  OR (neighborhood ILIKE '%commercial%' AND neighborhood ILIKE '%core%')
)
ORDER BY neighborhood;
Distinct values found: BELLTOWN; DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL; PIONEER SQUARE.

3) Violent crime counts (offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME') for three core downtown neighborhoods (Belltown, Downtown Commercial, Pioneer Square), offense_date basis
SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND neighborhood IN ('BELLTOWN','DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL','PIONEER SQUARE')
  AND (
    (offense_date >= TIMESTAMP '2024-06-01' AND offense_date < TIMESTAMP '2024-09-01')
    OR
    (offense_date >= TIMESTAMP '2025-06-01' AND offense_date < TIMESTAMP '2025-09-01')
  )
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
Results: 2024 = 192; 2025 = 220. Percent change ≈ +14.58% (increase).

4) Same downtown set, using report_datetime instead of offense_date
SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM report_datetime)::int AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE UPPER(neighborhood) IN ('BELLTOWN','DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL','PIONEER SQUARE')
  AND TRIM(UPPER(offense_category)) = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND (
      (report_datetime >= DATE '2024-06-01' AND report_datetime < DATE '2024-09-01')
   OR (report_datetime >= DATE '2025-06-01' AND report_datetime < DATE '2025-09-01')
  )
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
Results: 2024 = 192; 2025 = 215. Percent change ≈ +12.0% (increase).

5) Downtown Commercial only (often the downtown core), offense_date basis
SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS incident_count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND neighborhood = 'DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL'
  AND (
        (offense_date >= DATE '2024-06-01' AND offense_date < DATE '2024-09-01')
     OR (offense_date >= DATE '2025-06-01' AND offense_date < DATE '2025-09-01')
  )
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;
Results: 2024 = 112; 2025 = 105. Percent change ≈ −6.25% (decrease).

6) Expanded downtown (adding Chinatown/International District), offense_date basis
SQL:
WITH counts AS (
  SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int AS year, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.crime_data
  WHERE neighborhood IN ('BELLTOWN','DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL','PIONEER SQUARE','CHINATOWN/INTERNATIONAL DISTRICT')
    AND offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
    AND EXTRACT(MONTH FROM offense_date) IN (6,7,8)
    AND EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date)::int IN (2024, 2025)
  GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2024 THEN cnt END),0) AS total_2024,
  COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2025 THEN cnt END),0) AS total_2025,
  CASE WHEN COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2024 THEN cnt END),0) = 0 THEN NULL
       ELSE ROUND(((COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2025 THEN cnt END),0) - COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2024 THEN cnt END),0))::numeric
                    / COALESCE(SUM(CASE WHEN year=2024 THEN cnt END),0)) * 100, 2)
  END AS percent_change
FROM counts;
Results: total_2024 = 274; total_2025 = 286; percent_change = +4.38% (increase).

7) Citywide violent crime (for context), offense_date basis
SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date::date) AS year,
       COUNT(*) AS violent_crime_incidents
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND (
        (offense_date::date >= DATE '2024-06-01' AND offense_date::date < DATE '2024-09-01')
     OR (offense_date::date >= DATE '2025-06-01' AND offense_date::date < DATE '2025-09-01')
  )
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM offense_date::date)
ORDER BY year;
Results: 2024 = 1,488; 2025 = 1,448. Percent change ≈ −2.69% (decrease).

Additional diagnostic (why a 36% figure might appear elsewhere)
- Within DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL, robbery (a violent subcategory in this dataset) fell from 40 to 23 (−42.5%) in Jun–Aug 2025 vs 2024, while aggravated assaults rose (65 → 72). This could lead to messaging about large drops in specific subcategories but does not translate to a 36% drop in overall violent crime downtown.
SQL for subcategory breakdown in DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL:
2024:
SELECT offense_sub_category, COUNT(*) AS incident_count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE neighborhood = 'DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL'
  AND offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND offense_date >= DATE '2024-06-01'
  AND offense_date < DATE '2024-09-01'
GROUP BY offense_sub_category
ORDER BY incident_count DESC, offense_sub_category;
2025:
SELECT offense_sub_category, COUNT(*) AS incident_count
FROM public.crime_data
WHERE neighborhood = 'DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL'
  AND offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME'
  AND offense_date >= DATE '2025-06-01'
  AND offense_date < DATE '2025-09-01'
GROUP BY offense_sub_category
ORDER BY incident_count DESC, offense_sub_category;

Conclusion
- The Seattle crime data do not support the claim that “violent crime incidents in downtown Seattle dropped by 36%” in Summer (Jun–Aug) 2025 versus the same period in 2024. Depending on how “downtown” is defined, overall violent crime either increased modestly or decreased slightly, but nowhere near 36%.

Assumptions and notes
- Violent crime was identified via offense_category = 'VIOLENT CRIME' as labeled in the dataset (this aligns with common public reporting groupings).
- The primary measure of occurrence used offense_date; I cross-checked with report_datetime and found similar directionality.
- “Downtown Seattle” was operationalized as the neighborhoods BELLTOWN, DOWNTOWN COMMERCIAL, and PIONEER SQUARE, and also tested with CHINATOWN/INTERNATIONAL DISTRICT included. If a different official boundary is provided, I can rerun the analysis.
- Date windows use inclusive June 1 through inclusive August 31 via [>= June 1, < September 1).
