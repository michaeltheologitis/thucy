Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact22) with a public.viral_disease table.
- Confirmed the table has a text column named family that captures the virus family assignment.
- Queried the data to count total records, detect NULL/empty family values, and look for textual markers indicating an unassigned family (e.g., the literal 'unassigned').

Data source and schema
- Database: postgres_tabfact22 (public schema)
- Table: public.viral_disease
- Relevant column: family (text, nullable)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total records in viral_disease
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM public.viral_disease;
Result:
- total = 23

2) Records where family is NULL or empty (whitespace-trimmed)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS unassigned_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NULL OR trim(family) = '';
Result:
- unassigned_count = 0

3) Distribution of family values (to inspect possible unassigned markers)
SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN family IS NULL THEN '<NULL>' WHEN trim(family) = '' THEN '<EMPTY_OR_WHITESPACE>' ELSE family END AS family_label, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY family_label ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result (family_label => count):
- filoviridae => 1
- bunyaviridae => 1
- poxviridae => 1
- flaviviridae => 1
- arenaviridae => 1
- papillomaviridae => 1
- rhabdoviridae => 1
- herpesviridae => 1
- retroviridae => 1
- caliciviridae => 1
- picornaviridae => 1
- astroviridae => 1
- paramyxoviridae => 1
- coronaviridae => 1
- togaviridae => 1
- hepadnaviridae => 1
- orthomyxoviridae => 1
- hepeviridae => 1
- polyomaviridae => 1
- adenoviridae => 1
- reoviridae => 1
- unassigned => 1
- parvoviridae => 1

4) Explicit check for common unassigned textual markers
SQL:
SELECT family, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND lower(trim(family)) IN ('unknown','unassigned','none','n/a','na','not assigned','not applicable','-','?') GROUP BY family ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- 'unassigned' => 1

Conclusion
- There are 23 viral_disease records in total.
- None have family as NULL or empty.
- Exactly one record uses the literal string 'unassigned' in the family column. Interpreting 'unassigned' as “not assigned to a family,” the claim that only 1 viral disease has not been assigned to a family is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpret the textual value 'unassigned' in the family column as indicating no family assignment. I also checked other common markers (unknown, none, etc.) and found none besides 'unassigned'.
