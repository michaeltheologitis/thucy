Claim to verify: “8 different country receive the same number of bronze medal.”

Data discovery and schema grounding:
- Available source: A PostgreSQL instance (public schema) with one relevant table: t_1988_winter_olympics.
- Table t_1988_winter_olympics columns: rank (bigint), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Verification approach:
- Interpret the claim as: there exists a bronze medal count that is shared by exactly eight distinct nations in the available medal table.
- Compute how many nations share each bronze count and check if any count is shared by 8 nations. Also identify the maximum tie size for additional context.

Executed SQL and results:
1) Group nations by bronze count to see how many nations share each value:
SQL:
SELECT bronze, COUNT(*) AS nation_count
FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
GROUP BY bronze
ORDER BY bronze;
Results (bronze -> number of nations):
- 2 -> 6 nations
- 3 -> 2 nations
- 5 -> 1 nation
- 6 -> 1 nation
- 9 -> 1 nation
Interpretation: No bronze count is shared by 8 nations.

2) Identify the maximum tie size and list the nations for that tie for context:
SQL (to find the maximum tie size):
SELECT bronze, COUNT(*) AS nations_with_count
FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
GROUP BY bronze
ORDER BY nations_with_count DESC, bronze;
Outcome: Maximum tie size is 6 nations at bronze = 2.

SQL (to list nations with bronze = 2):
SELECT nation, bronze
FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
WHERE bronze = 2
ORDER BY nation;
Resulting nations: austria (aut), finland (fin), italy (ita), netherlands (ned), sweden (swe), west germany (frg).

Conclusion:
- There is no bronze medal count shared by exactly eight nations. The largest group sharing the same bronze count is six nations (bronze = 2). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available medal dataset (1988 Winter Olympics) in the discovered database.
- “8 different country receive the same number of bronze medal” is interpreted as the existence of a bronze medal count shared by eight distinct countries. Even under a looser reading (“at least eight”), the data shows no bronze count with ≥ 8 nations (maximum is 6).
