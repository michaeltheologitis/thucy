Summary of findings:
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) containing one table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season, which lists the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season schedule/results.
- Interpreted claim: The first game of the (available) season occurred on August 31, 1947.

Evidence from data:
1) Query to identify the first game (smallest week number):
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
ORDER BY week ASC
LIMIT 1;

Result:
- week: 1
- date: august 31 , 1947
- opponent: brooklyn dodgers
- result: w
- score: 23 - 7
- record: 1 - 0

Conclusion:
- The table shows the first game (week 1) has the date "august 31 , 1947." This supports the claim that August 31, 1947 is the date of the first game of the season represented in the available data (the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season).

Assumptions:
- “Season” refers to the only available season dataset in the database: the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season.
- “First game” is defined as the row with the smallest value in the week column.
