Claim interpreted: “The first project proposed is ‘Potter Co’ in Copiah (County), and it has not yet been listed.”

Findings grounded in data:
- There is exactly one Mississippi Superfund site with name matching “Potter” in Copiah County. Its Proposed date is 05/10/1993, and its Listed value is stored as a hyphen (“-”), which the dataset uses for not-listed/missing dates.
- Within Copiah County, this is the only row; therefore it is trivially the first (and only) proposed site there by date. However, it is not the earliest proposed site statewide; the earliest proposed statewide in this dataset is Flowood Site (Rankin County) on 09/08/1983.
- The statement “not yet listed” is supported by the data for the Potter Co row (Listed is “-”, which we treat as not listed), and by comparison many other sites have an actual listed date.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL and results:
1) Retrieve any site in Copiah with name containing “Potter”
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE county ILIKE 'Copiah' AND name ILIKE '%Potter%';
Result:
{ "cerclis id": "msd056029648", "name": "potter co", "county": "copiah", "proposed": "05 / 10 / 1993", "listed": "-", "construction completed": "-", "partially deleted": "-", "deleted": "-" }

2) Confirm count of matching rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE county ILIKE 'Copiah' AND name ILIKE '%Potter%';
Result:
{ "match_count": 1 }

3) Check the Listed value for the Potter Co row
SQL:
SELECT listed, (listed = '') AS is_blank, (LOWER(listed) = 'no') AS is_no FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE county ILIKE 'Copiah' AND name ILIKE '%Potter%';
Result:
{ "listed": "-", "is_blank": false, "is_no": false }
Interpretation: the literal value is a hyphen “-”, which is used as a placeholder indicating no listed date.

4) All Copiah County rows ordered by parsed Proposed date (normalize '-'/blank to NULL)
SQL:
SELECT
  "name",
  CASE WHEN trim("proposed")='' OR trim("proposed")='-' THEN NULL ELSE trim("proposed") END AS proposed,
  CASE WHEN trim("proposed")='' OR trim("proposed")='-' THEN NULL ELSE to_date(replace(trim("proposed"), ' ', ''),'MM/DD/YYYY') END AS parsed_proposed_date,
  CASE WHEN trim("listed")='' OR trim("listed")='-' THEN NULL ELSE trim("listed") END AS listed
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE county ILIKE '%copiah%'
ORDER BY parsed_proposed_date ASC;
Result:
name: potter co | proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993 | parsed_proposed_date: 1993-05-10 | listed: NULL
Observation: Potter Co is the only Copiah row and thus first by date within Copiah County.

5) Earliest proposed date statewide and site(s) with that date
SQL (earliest date):
SELECT MIN(to_date(replace(proposed,' ',''),'MM/DD/YYYY')) AS earliest_proposed
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE replace(coalesce(proposed,''),' ','') ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{4}$';
Result:
[{"earliest_proposed":"1983-09-08T00:00:00Z"}]
SQL (sites on that earliest date):
SELECT name, county, proposed
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE replace(coalesce(proposed,''),' ','') ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{4}$'
  AND to_date(replace(proposed,' ',''),'MM/DD/YYYY') = DATE '1983-09-08';
Result:
[{"county":"rankin","name":"flowood site","proposed":"09 / 08 / 1983"}]
Observation: Potter Co (1993-05-10) is not first statewide by proposed date.

6) Examples showing that “listed” normally stores actual dates when listed (for context)
SQL:
SELECT name, county, proposed, listed,
       to_date(regexp_replace(listed, '[[:space:]]', '', 'g'), 'MM/DD/YYYY') AS parsed_listed_date
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE listed IS NOT NULL
  AND trim(listed) <> ''
  AND listed <> '-'
  AND regexp_replace(listed, '[[:space:]]', '', 'g') ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{1,2}/[0-9]{4}$'
ORDER BY parsed_listed_date ASC
LIMIT 5;
Result (examples):
- flowood site | rankin | proposed 09 / 08 / 1983 | listed 09 / 21 / 1984 | parsed_listed_date 1984-09-21
- newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc | marion | proposed 10 / 15 / 1984 | listed 06 / 10 / 1986 | 1986-06-10
- davis timber company | lamar | proposed 05 / 11 / 2000 | listed 07 / 27 / 2000 | 2000-07-27
- american creosote works , inc | winston | proposed 06 / 14 / 2001 | listed 09 / 13 / 2001 | 2001-09-13
- picayune wood treating | pearl river | proposed 03 / 08 / 2004 | listed 07 / 22 / 2004 | 2004-07-22

Conclusion:
- Supported: “Potter Co in Copiah … has not yet been listed.” The dataset contains one row for Potter Co (Copiah) with Proposed = 05/10/1993 and Listed = “-” (treated as not listed).
- Ambiguous/Not supported as a statewide statement: “the first project proposed.” Potter Co is not the first proposed site statewide; the earliest proposed statewide is Flowood Site (Rankin) on 09/08/1983. If “first” is intended only within Copiah County, Potter Co is the only Copiah entry and is trivially first there.

Assumptions noted:
- I interpret a hyphen “-” in date fields as representing no date / not applicable (i.e., not listed). This is consistent with other rows where listed dates are provided as actual dates.
- The fragment “first project proposed” is ambiguous; I evaluated both the statewide interpretation (not true) and the Copiah-County-only interpretation (trivially true because it is the only Copiah entry).
