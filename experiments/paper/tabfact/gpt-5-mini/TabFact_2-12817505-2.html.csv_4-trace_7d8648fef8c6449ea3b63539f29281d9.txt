Data sources explored
- Connected database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Discovered table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season (columns: date [text], opponents [text], h / a [text], result f - a [text], attendance [bigint], league position [text])

Evidence from data
1) Query to find the match(es) with the minimum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE attendance = (
  SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
);

Result:
- date: 11 february 2006
- opponents: portsmouth
- h / a: a
- result f - a: 3 - 1
- attendance: 20206

Assessment
- The dataset’s lowest attendance match is dated "11 february 2006". This directly supports the claim that the game with the lowest attendance happened on 11 February 2006.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the scope of the available dataset (Manchester United F.C. 2005–06 season) and “game” means a match listed in this table.
- Attendance minimization uses the attendance column (bigint). Nulls, if any, are ignored by MIN.
