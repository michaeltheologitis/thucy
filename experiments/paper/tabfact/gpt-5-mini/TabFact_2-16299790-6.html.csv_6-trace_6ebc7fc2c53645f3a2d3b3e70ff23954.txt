Scope and data discovery
- Data sources: Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL data source: postgres_tabfact8 (TabFact), schema public, containing a single table.
- Schema details: Table public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Locate Tiger Woods’ entry and read the recorded score text.
SQL executed:
SELECT player, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'Tiger Woods';
Result:
- player = "tiger woods"
- score = "67 + 68 + 70 = 205"

2) Parse the total from the score field and test whether it is less than 205.
SQL executed:
SELECT player, score, trim(split_part(score, '=' , 2)) AS after_eq, regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '=' , 2)), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g') AS score_digits, (regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '=' , 2)), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'))::int AS score_int, ((regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '=' , 2)), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'))::int < 205) AS less_than_205 FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'Tiger Woods';
Result:
- after_eq = "205"
- score_int = 205
- less_than_205 = false

Findings
- The table records Tiger Woods’ total in the score field as 205.
- The comparison “score < 205” evaluates to false because 205 is equal to, not less than, 205.

Conclusion
- The claim that Tiger Woods’ score is less than 205 is not supported by the data; it is contradicted by the recorded value of 205.

Assumptions
- “tiger wood” refers to the player entry spelled “tiger woods”.
- The numeric score to compare is the total after the equals sign in the score text (e.g., "67 + 68 + 70 = 205").
- The relevant context is the available table t_2002_u_s_open_golf, treated as authoritative for this verification.
