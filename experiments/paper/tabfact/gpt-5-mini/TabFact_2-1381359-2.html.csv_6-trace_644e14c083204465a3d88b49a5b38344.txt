Claim to verify: “tenri be the winner in the game that have teikyo as the runner - up.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL data source: TabFact public schema, containing one relevant table: public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship (columns: title, season, winner, score, runner - up, venue, attendance).

Method:
- Searched the all_japan_university_rugby_championship table for any season where the winner contains “Tenri” and the runner-up contains “Teikyo.” Also checked occurrences of each individually to understand what the table contains.

Evidence (exact executed SQL and results):
1) Direct check for any matches where winner contains Tenri and runner-up contains Teikyo
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE winner ILIKE '%Tenri%' AND "runner - up" ILIKE '%Teikyo%';
Result:
[{"match_count":0}]

2) Check if any winner contains Tenri at all
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tenri_wins
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE winner ILIKE '%Tenri%';
Result:
[{"tenri_wins":0}]

3) Count how many runner-up entries contain Teikyo
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS teikyo_runnerups
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE "runner - up" ILIKE '%Teikyo%';
Result:
[{"teikyo_runnerups":1}]

4) Show the row(s) where the runner-up contains Teikyo
SQL:
SELECT season, title, winner, score, "runner - up" AS runner_up, venue, attendance
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE "runner - up" ILIKE '%Teikyo%';
Result:
[{"attendance":"22344","runner_up":"teikyo","score":"20 - 10","season":"2008 - 9 details","title":"45th","venue":"national stadium , tokyo , tokyo","winner":"waseda"}]

Findings:
- There are zero rows where “Tenri” is the winner at all (Query 2), hence zero where Tenri is winner and Teikyo is runner-up (Query 1).
- The only row with Teikyo as runner-up (season 2008–09, 45th championship) lists the winner as Waseda, not Tenri (Query 4).

Conclusion:
- The claim that Tenri was the winner in a game where Teikyo was the runner-up is not supported by the available data; the data shows Waseda as the winner when Teikyo was runner-up.

Assumptions and scope:
- “game” is interpreted as the championship event recorded in the all_japan_university_rugby_championship table.
- “Tenri” and “Teikyo” refer to Tenri University and Teikyo University, respectively.
- Verification is constrained to the authoritative TabFact data source available here.
