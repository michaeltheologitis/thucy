Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Bell Media’s station with call sign CHSU-FM operates on the frequency 99.9 FM (and/or that CHSU-FM at 99.9 FM is owned by Bell Media).

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) via postgres_tabfact6.
- Schema inspection identified a relevant table: public.media_in_kelowna with columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text).

Evidence from the database (with exact executed SQL and returned rows)
1) Broad listing to locate the record:
SQL:
SELECT "frequency", "call sign", "owner"
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
ORDER BY "call sign";
Returned rows (excerpt showing the relevant row):
{"call sign":"chsu - fm","frequency":"00 99.9 fm","owner":"bell media"}

2) Targeted match for the call sign (case/punctuation-insensitive) to retrieve frequency and owner:
SQL:
SELECT "frequency", "owner", "call sign"
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
WHERE regexp_replace(lower("call sign"), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g') = regexp_replace(lower('CHSU-FM'), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g');
Returned row:
{"call sign":"chsu - fm","frequency":"00 99.9 fm","owner":"bell media"}

Analysis
- The database explicitly lists a record with call sign stored as "chsu - fm" (lowercase with spaces around the hyphen). Normalizing punctuation/case equates this to CHSU-FM.
- The frequency field is stored as "00 99.9 fm"; the substantive frequency value is 99.9 FM.
- The owner field for this record is "bell media", i.e., Bell Media.
- Therefore, the data supports that CHSU-FM operates at 99.9 FM and is owned by Bell Media, which aligns with the user’s claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the database record: CHSU-FM — 99.9 FM — Bell Media.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing as asserting that CHSU-FM operates on 99.9 FM and is a Bell Media station.
- Normalized the stored strings (lowercase, spacing, and the leading "00 ") to conventional forms (CHSU-FM, 99.9 FM, Bell Media).
