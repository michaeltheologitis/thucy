Claim to verify: "of the 3 different position georgia and penn state contribute 2 of the same"

Step 1 — Identify available data and relevant table
- Data source discovered: TabFact PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact10)
- Relevant table (by schema search): public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  Columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, "school / club team"

Step 2 — Confirm how the schools appear in the data
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower("school / club team") LIKE '%georgia%' OR lower("school / club team") LIKE '%penn%' ORDER BY "school / club team";
Result:
- georgia
- penn state

Step 3 — Extract positions for Georgia and Penn State, with players for context
Georgia — distinct positions
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%georgia%';
Result:
- guard / forward

Georgia — players
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%georgia%' ORDER BY position, player;
Result:
- shandon anderson — guard / forward

Penn State — distinct positions
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%penn state%';
Result:
- center / forward

Penn State — players
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%penn state%' ORDER BY position, player;
Result:
- john amaechi — center / forward

Step 4 — Normalize multi-position entries and compute overlap
Georgia base position set (split on '/' and normalize): {forward, guard}
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT lower(trim(regexp_split_to_table(position, '\s*/\s*'))) AS pos FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' ORDER BY pos;

Penn State base position set: {center, forward}
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT lower(trim(regexp_split_to_table(position, '\s*/\s*'))) AS pos FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%' ORDER BY pos;

Overlap between Georgia and Penn State base positions: {forward}
Executed SQL:
WITH g AS (
  SELECT lower(trim(regexp_split_to_table(position, '\s*/\s*'))) AS pos
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%'
), p AS (
  SELECT lower(trim(regexp_split_to_table(position, '\s*/\s*'))) AS pos
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%'
)
SELECT DISTINCT pos FROM g INTERSECT SELECT DISTINCT pos FROM p ORDER BY pos;
Result:
- forward

Step 5 — Confirm there are exactly three base positions in this table
Executed SQL (raw values then tokenized base positions):
1) SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster ORDER BY position;
Raw results:
- center
- center / forward
- forward
- guard
- guard / forward

2) SELECT DISTINCT upper(token) AS base_position
   FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster,
        regexp_split_to_table(position, '[^A-Za-z]+') AS token
   WHERE token <> ''
   ORDER BY base_position;
Resulting base positions:
- CENTER
- FORWARD
- GUARD

Conclusion
- Georgia contributes the positions: guard and forward.
- Penn State contributes the positions: center and forward.
- Their intersection is only one position: forward.
- Therefore, they do NOT contribute “2 of the same” positions out of the three base positions; they share only 1.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the Utah Jazz all-time roster table and its "position" field (basketball positions: guard, forward, center).
- "Georgia" and "Penn State" refer to the school/club team entries exactly as stored in the table (matched case-insensitively as 'georgia' and 'penn state').
- Multi-position strings (e.g., "guard / forward") represent multiple base positions and are split on the '/' separator for comparison.
