Summary
- Claim: "the train that depart at 21.00 for grimsby town have an arrival time of 21.26"
- Finding: There is exactly one train to Grimsby Town departing at 21.00 in the available dataset, but its arrival time is 21.53, not 21.26.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: departure (text), "going to" (text), "calling at" (text), arrival (double precision), operator (text).

Executed SQL evidence
1) Check existence and uniqueness of the 21.00 departure to Grimsby Town
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("going to") = lower('Grimsby Town') AND (trim(departure) = '21.00' OR trim(departure) = '21:00');
Result:
match_count = 1

2) Retrieve the matching row to confirm arrival time
SQL:
SELECT departure, "going to", "calling at", arrival, operator FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("going to") = lower('Grimsby Town') AND (trim(departure) = '21.00' OR trim(departure) = '21:00');
Result:
- departure: "21.00"
- going to: "grimsby town"
- calling at: "alford , louth , waltham , grimsby town"
- arrival: 21.53
- operator: "gnr"

Conclusion
- The dataset confirms a train to Grimsby Town departing at 21.00 exists, but its arrival time is 21.53, not 21.26. Therefore, the stated arrival time is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive comparison on destination ("going to").
- Accepted departure formats '21.00' and '21:00' due to text storage of times.
- Treated public.my_info_table as the authoritative timetable for this verification.
