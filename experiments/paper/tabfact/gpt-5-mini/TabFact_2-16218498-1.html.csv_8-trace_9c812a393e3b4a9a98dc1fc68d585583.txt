Claim to verify: “botswana defence force xi have the lowest agg in the season.”

How I interpret the claim
- “agg” refers to the aggregate score over two legs as stored in the agg column of the dataset.
- “the season” refers to the competition season represented by the available table: t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- “lowest agg” could plausibly mean one of the following:
  1) The lowest total aggregate goals in a tie (sum of both teams’ goals).
  2) The lowest goals scored by a single team in a tie.
  3) The smallest margin or lowest conceded, etc.
I evaluate (1) and (2) explicitly with data; both are common readings. Either way, the data contradicts the claim.

Data source and structure
- Discovered database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (columns: "team 1" text, "agg" text, "team 2" text, "1st leg" text, "2nd leg" text)

Evidence from the data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Retrieve all ties and their agg values
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;

Returned (team 1 | agg | team 2):
- botswana defence force xi | 1 - 2 | mbabane highlanders
- arsenal (maseru) | 4 - 0 | eleven arrows fc
- cd elá nguema | 2 - 6 | primeiro de agosto
- lprc oilers | 2 - 3 | mighty blackpool
- asc police | 2 - 2 (4 - 5) | as real bamako
- port autonome | 0 - 0 (1 - 3) | sporting clube da praia
- saint - george sa | 2 - 4 | al ittihad
- saint - louis fc | 2 - 7 | young africans
- sahel sc | 4 - 2 | postel sport
- tourbillon fc | 1 - 1 | forces armées ca

2) Botswana Defence Force XI’s tie details (including parsed goals)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2", (regexp_matches(agg, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1]::int AS goals_team1, (regexp_matches(agg, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2]::int AS goals_team2, "1st leg", "2nd leg"
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE lower("team 1") = 'botswana defence force xi' OR lower("team 2") = 'botswana defence force xi';

Returned:
- team 1: botswana defence force xi | agg: 1 - 2 | team 2: mbabane highlanders | parsed goals: 1 (team1), 2 (team2) | 1st leg: 1 - 1 | 2nd leg: 0 - 1

3) Parse all ties to compute total aggregate goals and identify the minimum total
Executed SQL (per-row parse):
SELECT "team 1" AS team1,
       (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$', '\\1'))::int AS team1_goals,
       "team 2" AS team2,
       (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int AS team2_goals,
       ((regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$','\\1'))::int + (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int) AS total_goals
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE agg ~ '^\s*\d+\D+\d+';

Executed SQL (minimum total):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "team 1" AS team1,
         "team 2" AS team2,
         (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$','\\1'))::int AS team1_goals,
         (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int AS team2_goals,
         ((regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$','\\1'))::int + (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int) AS total_goals
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE agg ~ '^\s*\d+\D+\d+'
)
SELECT min(total_goals) AS min_total_goals FROM parsed;

Executed SQL (ties attaining that minimum):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "team 1" AS team1,
         "team 2" AS team2,
         (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$','\\1'))::int AS team1_goals,
         (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int AS team2_goals,
         ((regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*(\d+)\D.*$','\\1'))::int + (regexp_replace(agg, '^\s*\d+\D+(\d+).*$','\\1'))::int) AS total_goals
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE agg ~ '^\s*\d+\D+\d+'
)
SELECT team1, team1_goals, team2, team2_goals, total_goals
FROM parsed
WHERE total_goals = (SELECT min(total_goals) FROM parsed);

Findings:
- Minimum total aggregate goals across all ties = 0, achieved by: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia (agg: 0 - 0 (1 - 3)).
- Botswana Defence Force XI’s tie total = 3 (1 + 2), which is not the lowest.

4) Minimum goals scored by any team in a tie (considering both teams)
Executed SQL (inspect formats):
SELECT DISTINCT "agg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs LIMIT 200;

Executed SQL (compute minimum team goals and list teams achieving it):
WITH parsed AS (
 SELECT "team 1","team 2",
  (trim(split_part(trim(split_part("agg",'(',1)),'-',1)))::int AS g1,
  (trim(split_part(trim(split_part("agg",'(',1)),'-',2)))::int AS g2
 FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
),
minval AS (SELECT LEAST(MIN(g1), MIN(g2)) AS min_goal FROM parsed)
SELECT p."team 1" AS team, p."team 2" AS opponent, p.g1 AS goals
FROM parsed p, minval WHERE p.g1 = minval.min_goal
UNION ALL
SELECT p."team 2" AS team, p."team 1" AS opponent, p.g2 AS goals
FROM parsed p, minval WHERE p.g2 = minval.min_goal
ORDER BY team;

Findings:
- The minimum goals scored by any team in a tie is 0, achieved by: eleven arrows fc, port autonome, and sporting clube da praia.
- Botswana Defence Force XI scored 1, so they do not have the lowest individual team tally either.

5) Ordering all ties by total aggregate goals (for context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg",
 (substring("agg" from '^ *([0-9]+)')::int + substring("agg" from '- *([0-9]+)')::int) AS total_goals
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
ORDER BY total_goals ASC, "team 1" ASC;

Findings (top of the list):
- 0 total: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia (agg: 0 - 0 (1 - 3))
- 2 total: tourbillon fc vs forces armées ca (agg: 1 - 1)
- 3 total: botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders (agg: 1 - 2)
This confirms BDF XI’s tie is not the lowest.

Conclusion
Across all reasonable interpretations of “lowest agg” based on the available data for the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs table, Botswana Defence Force XI do not have the lowest aggregate. The lowest total aggregate goals in a tie is 0 (not 3), and the lowest goals scored by a single team in a tie is 0 (not 1). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions (made explicit due to ambiguity):
- “Season” maps to the competition captured by the available table (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs) since no other season dataset is available.
- “agg” refers to the leading X - Y aggregate in the agg column, excluding any parenthetical penalty results.
- “lowest agg” was evaluated as (a) minimum total goals in a tie and (b) minimum goals by a single team in a tie; in both readings, BDF XI are not the minimum.
