Claim to verify:
"In 1980, the East region result was a loss of 72-86 from a 12 seed, and the year is smaller than 1996."

What I checked in the data:
- Whether there is a 1980 entry for VCU Rams men’s basketball with region = East, seed = 12, and results indicating a loss 72-86.
- Whether this entry also satisfies year < 1996.

Evidence from the database:
1) Retrieve the 1980 row
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1980;

Result:
- year: 1980
- seed: 12
- region: east
- results: l 72 - 86

2) Confirm it meets the constraint year < 1996, region East, and result 72-86
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year < 1996 AND region ILIKE '%East%' AND (results ILIKE '%72-86%' OR results ILIKE '%72–86%' OR results ILIKE '%72 - 86%');

Result:
- year: 1980
- seed: 12
- region: east
- results: l 72 - 86

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- Year = 1980: Supported by the row retrieved.
- Region = East: Stored as "east" (case-insensitive match) – supported.
- Seed = 12: Supported.
- Result = loss 72-86: Stored as "l 72 - 86" – supported.
- Year < 1996: 1980 is less than 1996 – supported.

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the VCU Rams men’s basketball dataset provided, where the "region" and "results" fields denote NCAA tournament region and game outcome/score for that season.
