Claim to verify: “the episode that air on december 17 have a higher production number than the ray j episode and the episode title '702'.”

What the data shows (from the TabFact public.list_of_all_that_episodes table):
- December 17 episode
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
    FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
    WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%December 17%';
  - Result: season 6, series 43, episode title: music special, original air date: december 17 , 1996, nick prod: 343

- “ray j” episode
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
    FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
    WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%ray j%';
  - Result: season 14, series 51, episode title: ray j, original air date: february 8 , 1997, nick prod: 351

- Episode titled ‘702’
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
    FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
    WHERE "episode title" = '702';
  - Result: season 8, series 45, episode title: 702, original air date: december 28 , 1996, nick prod: 345

Comparison of production numbers (nick prod):
- December 17 episode: 343
- “ray j” episode: 351
- ‘702’ episode: 345

Finding:
- 343 is lower than both 351 (ray j) and 345 (702). Therefore, the December 17 episode does not have a higher production number than either comparator.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “the episode that air on december 17” refers to any All That episode whose original air date contains “December 17”; the dataset returns exactly one such episode (December 17, 1996).
- “the ray j episode” refers to the episode whose title contains “ray j” (case-insensitive), which appears once in the dataset.
- Production number is taken from the “nick prod” column.
