Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate UFC-related event/fight results.
- Queried the data for any fights logged as taking place at “UFC 20” and examined their methods of victory.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact/postgres_tabfact23) with a public schema.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: One table relevant to fight results was found:
  - public.fabiano_iha (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)
  - This table stores fight results for the fighter Fabiano Iha, including event name and method.

Evidence query and results
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, method, CASE WHEN LOWER(method) LIKE '%unanimous%' THEN true ELSE false END AS unanimous, event, res, round, time
  FROM public.fabiano_iha
  WHERE event ILIKE '%UFC 20%';

- Returned row:
  - opponent: laverne clark
  - method: tko (cut)
  - unanimous: false
  - event: ufc 20
  - res: loss
  - round: 1
  - time: 1:31

Assessment
- The available dataset contains at least one fight at UFC 20: Fabiano Iha vs. LaVerne Clark. That bout ended by TKO (cut), not by decision—let alone a unanimous decision.
- Therefore, any reading of the claim that implies UFC 20’s outcomes (in whole or in part) were by unanimous decision is contradicted by the data we have: at least one UFC 20 bout clearly was not a unanimous decision.
- Limitation: The dataset only includes the fight history for Fabiano Iha, not all UFC 20 bouts. We cannot directly verify the outcome of the event’s final/main event from this dataset alone.

Conclusion
- Based on the evidence available in the connected database, the claim that “the UFC 20 event ended with a method of decision (unanimous)” is not supported; our data shows a UFC 20 fight that ended by TKO, not a unanimous decision.

Assumptions and notes
- Interpreted “eveny” as “event” and “unanimus” as “unanimous.”
- Interpreted the claim to suggest the event outcome(s) were unanimous decisions; our verification is constrained to the accessible data, which includes at least one UFC 20 bout ending by TKO.
