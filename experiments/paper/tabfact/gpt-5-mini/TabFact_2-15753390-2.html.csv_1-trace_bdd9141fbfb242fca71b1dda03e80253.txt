Summary
- I explored the available data sources and identified a racing results table relevant to the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema).

Schema explored
- Table: public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt
  - Columns: place (bigint), rider (text), country (text), machine (text), speed (text), time (text), points (bigint)
  - This table directly contains race placements, machines (manufacturers), and speeds.

Evidence query and result
- Executed SQL:
SELECT place, rider, machine, speed
FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt
WHERE place = 5 AND machine ILIKE '%BMW%';

- Result:
  - place: 5
  - rider: barry dungworth / rwturrington
  - machine: bmw
  - speed: 82.32 mph

Assessment
- The table shows that the 5th-place entry riding a BMW has a recorded speed of 82.32 mph. This directly supports the claim that “the 5th place BMW [goes] at 82.32 mph.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted “go at” as the recorded speed value in the speed column for the 5th-place finisher.
- Interpreted “bmw” as matching the machine field (manufacturer) via case-insensitive match.
