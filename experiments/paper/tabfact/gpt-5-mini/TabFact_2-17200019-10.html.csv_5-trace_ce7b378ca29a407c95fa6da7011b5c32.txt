Claim interpreted: “There are 4 players who scored 3 goals in total, and all 4 are in league 5.” I verified this against the available data for the 2008–09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact)
- Public schema contains one table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season with columns (player, league, title playoff, super cup, total).

Schema context
- Column meanings (inferred from data):
  • league: goals in league competition
  • title playoff: goals in title playoff
  • super cup: goals in Super Cup
  • total: sum across competitions

Quick look at sample rows (to understand value ranges)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
LIMIT 15;

Key sample results (truncated):
- jonathan legear — league: 5, title playoff: 1, super cup: 0, total: 7
- lucas biglia — league: 2, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
- dmitri bulykin — league: 3, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
- jelle van damme — league: 3, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
...

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count players with total = 3 and list them
SQL executed:
SELECT player, league FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3 ORDER BY player;

Result:
- dmitri bulykin — league: 3
- jan polák — league: 2
- jelle van damme — league: 3
- lucas biglia — league: 2
- matías suárez — league: 1

2) Count of players with total = 3
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_total_eq_3 FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3;

Result:
- count_total_eq_3: 5

3) Count of players with league = 5
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_league_eq_5 FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE league = 5;

Result:
- count_league_eq_5: 1

4) Intersection: players with both total = 3 and league = 5
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_both FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3 AND league = 5;

Result:
- count_both: 0

Findings
- There are 5 players (not 4) with total = 3.
- Only 1 player has league = 5, and none of the players with total = 3 has league = 5.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in this table.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “score 3 goal total” as players with total = 3 in this dataset.
- I interpreted “be in league 5” as those players having league = 5 (since the table does not include league identifiers/divisions, only a “league” goals column).
