Conclusion: Verified. The data shows a game where Alabama was the opponent with an attendance of 80079.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema and at least one table.
  Tool: discover_data_sources
  Result: “I was able to access a PostgreSQL data source (the TabFact/Postgres connector…) … public schema … contains at least one table.”

Schema inspection
- Relevant table identified: public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
  Columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text)
  Tool: schema_query
  Result: “Tables and columns: - east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 … opponent … attendance …”

Evidence query
- Goal: Find rows where the opponent is Alabama and check the attendance value.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Alabama%';
- Query result (from tool):
  - date: october 17
    opponent: alabama
    site: legion field birmingham , al
    result: l22 - 23
    attendance: 80079

Assessment
- The table explicitly records a game with opponent “alabama” and attendance “80079.” This directly supports the claim that there was a crowd attendance of 80079 when Alabama was the opponent.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the East Carolina Pirates football games from 1990–1999 contained in the available dataset.
- “Crowd attendance” corresponds to the “attendance” field in the table, which is stored as text but clearly shows the numeric value 80079.
