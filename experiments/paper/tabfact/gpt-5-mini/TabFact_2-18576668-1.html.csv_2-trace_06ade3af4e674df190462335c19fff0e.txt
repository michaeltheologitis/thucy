Task: Convert the provided season strings into a single standard format.

Chosen standard: Expanded year range with no spaces and a single hyphen, i.e., YYYY-YYYY. This format is unambiguous and works well in data systems.

Conversions:
- 2001 - 02 -> 2001-2002
- 2002 - 03 -> 2002-2003
- 2003 - 04 -> 2003-2004

Evidence and SQL: This is a formatting transformation and does not require data lookup. No SQL was executed.

Assumptions:
- "Standard format" refers to an unambiguous expanded-year form (YYYY-YYYY). If your standard is the sports style (YYYY–YY with an en dash), the equivalents would be 2001–02, 2002–03, 2003–04.
