Claim to verify: “Daniel Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008 and replaced by Carlos de Toro on 29 December 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available database: TabFact (schema: public). It contains one relevant table: public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 with columns: team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replaced by, date of appointment, position in table.

Evidence from the data
1) Managerial changes involving Daniel Uberti or Carlos de Toro
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, "outgoing manager", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "replaced by", "date of appointment"
  FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
  WHERE "outgoing manager" ILIKE '%Uberti%' OR "replaced by" ILIKE '%de Toro%';

- Results:
  • team: nejapa; outgoing manager: daniel uberti; manner of departure: sacked; date of vacancy: 29 december 2008; replaced by: nelson ancheta; date of appointment: 29 december 2008
  • team: balboa; outgoing manager: roberto gamarra; manner of departure: mutual consent; date of vacancy: 1 january 2009; replaced by: carlos de toro; date of appointment: 16 january 2009

Assessment of the claim
- “Daniel Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008”: Supported. The Nejapa record shows he was sacked with a vacancy date of 29 December 2008.
- “and replaced by Carlos de Toro on 29 December 2008”: Not supported. The data shows Uberti’s replacement at Nejapa was Nelson Ancheta on 29 December 2008. Separately, Carlos de Toro was appointed at Balboa on 16 January 2009, not on 29 December 2008, and not as Uberti’s direct replacement.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct dismissal date for Daniel Uberti with an incorrect replacement and date regarding Carlos de Toro.

Assumptions
- The verification is grounded in the available dataset for Primera División de Fútbol Profesional Apertura 2008 (El Salvador). The claim was interpreted as referring to managerial changes captured in this competition’s 2008 data.
