Claim to verify: "steve gould be lead in richmond"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema). Relevant table discovered: t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials.

Schema context (from schema inspection):
- Columns: skip (text), third / vice skip (text), second (text), lead (text), city (text).

Evidence 1: Check for any row where the lead is Steve Gould or the city is Richmond.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead", "city"
  FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
  WHERE "lead" = 'Steve Gould' OR "city" ILIKE '%Richmond%';
- Result:
  • Row with city = richmond: skip = greg mcaulay; third / vice skip = ken maskiewich; second = deane horning; lead = aaron watson.
  • No row where lead = 'Steve Gould' and city contains 'Richmond'.

Evidence 2: Confirm where Steve Gould appears in the table and his listed position/city.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
  WHERE skip ILIKE '%Gould%'
     OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Gould%'
     OR second ILIKE '%Gould%'
     OR lead ILIKE '%Gould%';
- Result:
  • Row found: city = winnipeg; skip = jeff stoughton; third / vice skip = kevin park; second = rob fowler; lead = steve gould.

Assessment:
- The data shows Steve Gould is listed as a lead, but for a team from Winnipeg, not Richmond.
- The Richmond team’s lead is Aaron Watson, not Steve Gould.

Conclusion: The claim that “Steve Gould [is] lead in Richmond” is not supported by the table. He is a lead, but not for a Richmond team in this dataset.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- Interpreted “be lead in richmond” as referring to the team city listed as Richmond in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials table, and whether Steve Gould is the lead for that team. If a different Richmond or competition was intended, it isn’t represented in the available data source.
