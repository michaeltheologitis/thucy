Conclusion: Verified. The Yugoslavia national team lost a Balkan Cup tie against Romania with a 3–4 aggregate.

What I checked in the data
- I searched the Yugoslavia national team match results for Balkan Cup matches against Romania.
- I listed the relevant matches and computed the aggregate goals from the recorded scores.

Supporting evidence
1) Listing the Balkan Cup matches vs Romania
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan%' AND opponent ILIKE '%Romania%'
ORDER BY date;

Returned rows:
- date: august 27 | city: bucharest , romania | opponent: romania | results: 1:4 | type of game: balkan cup
- date: march 30 | city: belgrade | opponent: romania | results: 2:0 | type of game: balkan cup

2) Parsing and totaling the aggregate (YugoslaviaGoals:OpponentGoals)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, "type of game", results,
       CAST(trim(split_part(regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g'), ':', 1)) AS INTEGER) AS yugoslavia_goals,
       CAST(trim(split_part(regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g'), ':', 2)) AS INTEGER) AS opponent_goals
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%balkan%'
  AND opponent ILIKE '%romania%'
  AND regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g') ~ '^\s*\d+\s*:\s*\d+';

Returned rows with parsed scores:
- march 30, Belgrade: results 2:0 → YugoslaviaGoals=2, OpponentGoals=0
- august 27, Bucharest: results 1:4 → YugoslaviaGoals=1, OpponentGoals=4

3) Aggregate totals
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(yugoslavia_goals) AS total_yugoslavia_goals,
       SUM(opponent_goals) AS total_opponent_goals
FROM (
  SELECT CAST(trim(split_part(regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g'), ':', 1)) AS INTEGER) AS yugoslavia_goals,
         CAST(trim(split_part(regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g'), ':', 2)) AS INTEGER) AS opponent_goals
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%balkan%'
    AND opponent ILIKE '%romania%'
    AND regexp_replace(results, '-', ':', 'g') ~ '^\s*\d+\s*:\s*\d+'
) t;

Returned totals:
- total_yugoslavia_goals = 3
- total_romania_goals = 4

Assessment of each part of the claim
- "Yugoslavian national team": Yes — the data source is specifically the Yugoslavia national team match results table.
- "lose the Balkan Cup against Romania": The two recorded Balkan Cup matches vs Romania produce an aggregate where Romania outscored Yugoslavia.
- "aggregate score of 3:4": Totals computed from the scores 2:0 and 1:4 yield 3 (Yugoslavia) to 4 (Romania). This matches the claim exactly.

Assumptions
- The results column is from Yugoslavia’s perspective (first number = Yugoslavia goals). This is consistent with the home/away context and the aggregate computed.
- The two listed Balkan Cup fixtures vs Romania constitute the deciding tie of that Balkan Cup edition. The table does not annotate round/final explicitly, but the aggregate determines the outcome between the two teams.
