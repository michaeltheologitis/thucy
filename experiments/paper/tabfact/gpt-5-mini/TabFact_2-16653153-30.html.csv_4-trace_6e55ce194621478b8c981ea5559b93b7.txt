Claim: “the perth wildcat and townsville crocodile both have the same loss record for the season.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.
- Identified a relevant table: public.t_2008_09_nbl_season, which contains per-team standings for the 2008–09 NBL season, including a 'lost' column.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Schema exploration (tool report):
- Table: t_2008_09_nbl_season
  - Columns: team (text), lost (bigint), last 5 (text), streak (text), home (text), away (text), % pts (double precision), % won (double precision)

2) Inspect team names and loss counts to confirm exact strings and values.
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season LIMIT 20;

Result excerpt:
[{"lost":8,"team":"south dragons"},
 {"lost":10,"team":"melbourne tigers"},
 {"lost":12,"team":"new zealand breakers"},
 {"lost":13,"team":"perth wildcats"},
 {"lost":13,"team":"townsville crocodiles"},
 {"lost":15,"team":"adelaide 36ers"},
 ...]

3) Retrieve the two specific teams’ loss counts.
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team IN ('perth wildcats','townsville crocodiles');

Result:
[{"lost":13,"team":"perth wildcats"},
 {"lost":13,"team":"townsville crocodiles"}]

4) Explicit comparison of loss counts.
Executed SQL:
SELECT pw.lost AS perth_lost, tc.lost AS townsville_lost, (pw.lost = tc.lost) AS losses_equal
FROM (SELECT lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team = 'perth wildcats') pw
CROSS JOIN (SELECT lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team = 'townsville crocodiles') tc;

Result:
[{"perth_lost":13,"townsville_lost":13,"losses_equal":true}]

Conclusion:
- In the 2008–09 NBL season, Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles each recorded 13 losses. The claim is supported for that season.

Assumptions:
- “the season” was interpreted as the specific season represented in the available dataset (2008–09 NBL), where both teams are present. Team names appear in lowercase in the table (e.g., “perth wildcats”, “townsville crocodiles”).
