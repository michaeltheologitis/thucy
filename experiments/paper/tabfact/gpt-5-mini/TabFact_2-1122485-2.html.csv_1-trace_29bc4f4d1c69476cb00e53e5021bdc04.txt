Summary conclusion
- Yes. In the available dataset (t_1971_south_african_grand_prix), engine trouble is the most common retirement issue.

What I checked
- The table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix has a column named "time / retired" that contains either a finishing time/gap (e.g., "+ 1 lap", "1:47:35.5") or a retirement reason (e.g., "engine", "gearbox").
- I first enumerated all distinct values to see the distribution, then isolated only textual retirement reasons (excluding time/gap-like entries) and counted their frequencies.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Distinct values and raw counts in "time / retired"
SQL executed:
SELECT "time / retired", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY "time / retired"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "time / retired";

Key results observed:
- "+ 1 lap" — 4
- "+ 2 laps" — 4
- engine — 4
- overheating — 2
- "+ 1:09.4" — 1
- "+ 20.9" — 1
- "+ 31.4" — 1
- "+ 4 laps" — 1
- 1:47:35.5 — 1
- accident — 1
- differential — 1
- fuel leak — 1
- gearbox — 1
- physical — 1
- suspension — 1

2) Retirement reasons only (exclude time/gap-like values), with counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "time / retired", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE "time / retired" IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT ("time / retired" LIKE '+ %')
  AND "time / retired" !~ '[0-9]'
GROUP BY "time / retired"
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Results (reason => count):
- engine => 4
- overheating => 2
- fuel leak => 1
- gearbox => 1
- physical => 1
- accident => 1
- suspension => 1
- differential => 1

Interpretation
- Among retirement reasons, “engine” occurs 4 times, which is the highest frequency. The next most common, “overheating,” occurs 2 times. Therefore, engine trouble is the most common retirement issue in this dataset.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “issue affect time engine trouble be the most common” as asking whether engine trouble is the most common retirement issue in the "time / retired" field of the t_1971_south_african_grand_prix table. The verification is limited to this specific dataset (1971 South African Grand Prix).
