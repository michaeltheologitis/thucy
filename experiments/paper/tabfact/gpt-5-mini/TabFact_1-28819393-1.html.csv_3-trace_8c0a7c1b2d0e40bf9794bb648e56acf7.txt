Claim to verify: “the % of total vote for 1997 be 0.21.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results.
- Table columns include: year (text), candidates (bigint), total votes (bigint), average votes per candidate (bigint), % of total vote (double precision), average % of vote per candidate (double precision), saved deposits (bigint), number of mps (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve the % of total vote for 1997
SQL:
SELECT "year", "% of total vote" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE "year" = '1997';
Result:
- year = 1997, % of total vote = 0.21

2) Check that 1997 appears only once (uniqueness of the record)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_1997 FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE year = '1997';
Result:
- count_1997 = 1

Conclusion
- The table shows the % of total vote for the year 1997 is 0.21, and there is exactly one record for 1997. The claim is consistent with the data.

Assumptions
- “% of total vote” refers to the column named "% of total vote" in the table public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results.
- “1997” refers to the ‘year’ value stored as text '1997' in that table.
