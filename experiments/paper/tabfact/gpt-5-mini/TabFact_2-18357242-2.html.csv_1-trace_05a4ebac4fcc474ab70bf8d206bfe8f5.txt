Scope and interpretation
- I interpret the claim as: In the available racing results data, the drivers on the Patrick Racing team who have fewer than 2 points and a starting grid position greater than 4 are Ryan Hunter-Reay and Oriol Servià.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact14) hosting the TabFact dataset, public schema.
- Identified relevant table: public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix
  - Columns: driver (text), team (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint), points (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Confirm team naming and presence of Patrick Racing
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix ORDER BY team;
- Result excerpt includes: "patrick racing" (confirming team name used in this table).

2) List Patrick Racing entries with grid and points
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, team, grid, points
  FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix
  WHERE lower(team) = 'patrick racing';
- Result:
  - driver: "oriol servià", team: "patrick racing", grid: 4, points: 0
- Finding: The Patrick Racing entry has grid = 4 (not greater than 4) and points = 0 (< 2). Only Oriol Servià appears for Patrick Racing in this table.

3) Check Ryan Hunter-Reay’s team, grid, and points
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, team, grid, points FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix WHERE driver ILIKE '%Ryan%Hunter%Reay%';
- Result:
  - driver: "ryan hunter - reay", team: "american spirit team johansson", grid: 9, points: 1
- Finding: Ryan Hunter-Reay is not on Patrick Racing in this table; he is listed with American Spirit Team Johansson. He does satisfy points < 2 and grid > 4, but not the team condition.

4) Directly test the combined filter for Patrick Racing
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, team, grid, points
  FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix
  WHERE lower(team) = 'patrick racing' AND points < 2 AND grid > 4;
- Result: 0 rows
- Finding: No Patrick Racing drivers meet both conditions (points < 2 AND grid > 4) in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported. In this dataset:
  - Oriol Servià is on Patrick Racing with 0 points but grid = 4 (not > 4).
  - Ryan Hunter-Reay has 1 point and grid 9, but his team is American Spirit Team Johansson, not Patrick Racing.
  - There are zero drivers on Patrick Racing who have points < 2 and grid > 4.

Assumptions
- "player" refers to "driver" in the race results table.
- "patrick race team" refers to the team recorded as "patrick racing" in the table.
- "fewer than 2 point" means points < 2; "grid larger than 4" means grid > 4.
- The verification is grounded in the single relevant table available: public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix in the TabFact dataset.
