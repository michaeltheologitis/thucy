Claim assessed: "nick price be the only player from zimbabwe"

Scope of verification: The only available authoritative data source is a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) containing a single table: public.t_1996_pga_championship, which lists players, their countries, and results for the 1996 PGA Championship. The claim is interpreted within this dataset’s scope (i.e., whether Nick Price is the only Zimbabwean player in this event’s table).

Evidence from data
1) Distinct country values in the table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY country;
- Result:
  australia; fiji; new zealand; sweden; united states; zimbabwe

2) Distinct players recorded as from Zimbabwe
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT player FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%zimb%' ORDER BY player;
- Result:
  nick price

3) Count of distinct Zimbabwean players
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS zimbabwean_player_count FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%zimb%';
- Result:
  zimbabwean_player_count = 1

Conclusion: Within the 1996 PGA Championship table, Nick Price is the only player whose country is listed as Zimbabwe. This supports the claim in the context of the available data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the participants listed in the available 1996 PGA Championship dataset (public.t_1996_pga_championship), not to all sports or all tournaments globally.
- Matching for Zimbabwe used a case-insensitive substring search (ILIKE '%zimb%'), which is consistent with the observed country value "zimbabwe" in the table.
