Summary conclusion
- Claim interpreted: In the Cube film series table, the only person recorded as "alive after exiting the cube" is male. This is supported by the data: exactly one entry has that status, and that entry’s gender is male.

What data sources were checked
- TabFact database (postgres_tabfact19), public schema.

Schema discovery (tool: schema_query)
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19)
- Table: public.cube_film_series
  - Columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text)
  - No primary keys or foreign keys.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect all entries (names, genders, status)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, gender, status FROM public.cube_film_series;
Result rows:
- kazan | male | alive after exiting the cube
- david worth | male | dead
- quentin | male | dead
- joan leaven | female | dead
- dr helen holloway | female | dead
- rennes | male | dead

2) Count entries by status
Executed SQL:
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.cube_film_series
GROUP BY status
ORDER BY count DESC;
Results:
- dead: 5
- alive after exiting the cube: 1

3) Count entries exactly matching status "alive after exiting the cube"
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.cube_film_series
WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result:
- 1

4) Distinct genders among those with status "alive after exiting the cube"
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT gender
FROM public.cube_film_series
WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result:
- male

Assessment
- There is exactly one person with status "alive after exiting the cube" and that person is male (kazan). This directly supports the claim that the only person with that status in the cube is male.

Assumptions made
- "alive after exist" was interpreted as the dataset’s exact status value "alive after exiting the cube".
- "in the cube" was interpreted as referring to the table public.cube_film_series.
- "only person" was interpreted as uniqueness of the row for that status, which the counts confirm.
