Claim being checked: “Otto Graham has 44 more wins than Brady Quinn.”

Data source discovery:
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks

Schema details (from schema inspection):
- Columns: quarterback (text), uniform no (s) (text), games started (bigint), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), winning pct (double precision)

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Identify the exact rows for the two quarterbacks and their wins
Executed SQL:
SELECT quarterback, wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Graham%' OR quarterback ILIKE '%Quinn%';
Result:
- quarterback: graham , otto — wins: 57
- quarterback: quinn , brady — wins: 3

2) Compute the difference in wins (Otto Graham minus Brady Quinn)
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  (SELECT wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%graham%') AS otto_wins,
  (SELECT wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%quinn%') AS brady_wins,
  (SELECT wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%graham%') -
  (SELECT wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%quinn%') AS otto_minus_brady;
Result:
- otto_wins: 57
- brady_wins: 3
- otto_minus_brady: 54

Conclusion:
- According to the Browns starting quarterbacks table, Otto Graham has 57 wins and Brady Quinn has 3 wins as Browns starters. The difference is 54, not 44. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in the available authoritative source.

Assumptions noted:
- “Wins” are interpreted as wins as the starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, based on the only accessible authoritative dataset (list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks). This does not include wins for other NFL teams or leagues beyond what the table tracks.
- Name matching used case-insensitive substring searches on the quarterback field to locate the records for “graham , otto” and “quinn , brady.”
