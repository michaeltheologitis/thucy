Claim assessed: "fitzroy have a higher score than any of the other team"

Conclusion: The data contradicts this claim. In the only match in the available dataset involving Fitzroy, Fitzroy scored 97 while their opponent (Carlton) scored 106. Additionally, across all teams in the table, other teams achieved higher single‑match totals than Fitzroy’s 97 (e.g., Hawthorn scored 138). Therefore, Fitzroy did not have a higher score than the other team in their match, nor a higher maximum than any other team overall in this dataset.

Key evidence and executed SQL

1) Retrieve the match involving Fitzroy (shows the raw score strings):
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue"
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") = 'fitzroy' OR lower("away team") = 'fitzroy';
Result:
[{"home team":"fitzroy","home team score":"15.7 (97)","away team":"carlton","away team score":"16.10 (106)","date":"7 june 1975","venue":"junction oval"}]

2) Extract numeric totals from the score strings and determine which team had the higher total in that match:
SQL:
SELECT
  "home team",
  "home team score",
  (substring("home team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int AS home_points,
  "away team",
  "away team score",
  (substring("away team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int AS away_points,
  CASE
    WHEN (substring("home team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int > (substring("away team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int THEN "home team"
    WHEN (substring("home team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int < (substring("away team score" from '\\(([0-9]+)\\)'))::int THEN "away team"
    ELSE 'draw'
  END AS winner
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Fitzroy%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Fitzroy%';
Result:
[{"home team":"fitzroy","home team score":"15.7 (97)","home_points":97,"away team":"carlton","away team score":"16.10 (106)","away_points":106,"winner":"carlton"}]
Interpretation: In the Fitzroy match, Carlton’s 106 > Fitzroy’s 97, so Fitzroy did not have the higher score than the other team.

3) Compare Fitzroy’s maximum single‑match total to the maximum of all other teams (to test the stronger reading “higher than any other team” overall):
SQL:
WITH team_points AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, replace(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', '')::int AS points FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, replace(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', '')::int AS points FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
), team_max AS (
  SELECT team, MAX(points) AS team_max FROM team_points GROUP BY team
)
SELECT
  (SELECT team_max FROM team_max WHERE lower(team) = 'fitzroy') AS fitzroy_max,
  (SELECT MAX(team_max) FROM team_max WHERE lower(team) <> 'fitzroy') AS max_other,
  CASE WHEN (SELECT team_max FROM team_max WHERE lower(team) = 'fitzroy') > (SELECT MAX(team_max) FROM team_max WHERE lower(team) <> 'fitzroy') THEN true ELSE false END AS fitzroy_exceeds_all;
Result:
[{"fitzroy_max":97,"max_other":138,"fitzroy_exceeds_all":false}]
Interpretation: Fitzroy’s best is 97; at least one other team’s best is 138 (greater than 97), so Fitzroy does not have a higher score than every other team in the dataset.

Assumptions
- Data source: public.t_1975_vfl_season table in the available postgres_tabfact13 database was treated as the authoritative context for the claim.
- "Score" refers to the total points inside parentheses in the score strings (e.g., "15.7 (97)" → 97).
- Team name matching was done case‑insensitively; the table stores "fitzroy" in lowercase.
- Because this dataset contained only one match involving Fitzroy, we interpreted the claim both in the context of that match (Fitzroy vs Carlton) and, alternatively, as a comparison of Fitzroy’s maximum single‑match score against other teams’ maxima. Both interpretations contradict the claim.
