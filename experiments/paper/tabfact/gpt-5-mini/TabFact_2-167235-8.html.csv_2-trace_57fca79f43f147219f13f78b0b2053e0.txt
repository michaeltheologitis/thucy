Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema). No other data sources were detected.

Relevant schema
- Table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  - Columns (text): name; born - died; term start; term end; political party

Evidence
1) Locate both individuals and their raw term end values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Ahmeti%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%';
- Returned rows:
  {"born - died":"1948 -","name":"ylli bufi","political party":"socialist party of albania","term end":"10 december 1991","term start":"5 june 1991"}
  {"born - died":"1951 -","name":"vilson ahmeti","political party":"non - party","term end":"13 april 1992","term start":"10 december 1991"}

2) Parse the term end values as dates and compare
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT
    v.name AS vilson_name,
    v."term end" AS vilson_term_end_text,
    to_date(v."term end", 'DD Month YYYY') AS vilson_term_end_date,
    y.name AS ylli_name,
    y."term end" AS ylli_term_end_text,
    to_date(y."term end", 'DD Month YYYY') AS ylli_term_end_date,
    (to_date(v."term end", 'DD Month YYYY') > to_date(y."term end", 'DD Month YYYY')) AS vilson_after_ylli
  FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania v
  JOIN public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania y ON true
  WHERE v.name ILIKE 'vilson ahmeti' AND y.name ILIKE 'ylli bufi';
- Result:
  vilson_name: vilson ahmeti; vilson_term_end_text: 13 april 1992; vilson_term_end_date: 1992-04-13
  ylli_name: ylli bufi; ylli_term_end_text: 10 december 1991; ylli_term_end_date: 1991-12-10
  vilson_after_ylli: true

Analysis
- Parsed dates show Ylli Bufi’s term ended on 1991-12-10 and Vilson Ahmeti’s term ended on 1992-04-13. Since 1992-04-13 is after 1991-12-10, the claim is supported by the data.

Conclusion
- The term end for Vilson Ahmeti is after the term end for Ylli Bufi.

Assumptions
- Names were matched case-insensitively using ILIKE.
- The term end text values use a parseable format ‘DD Month YYYY’, handled by to_date().
