Claim to verify: “the indianapolis colt play the new york giant on september 10 at giant stadium , final score 26 - 21”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered one available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9).
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present (columns: date, visiting team, final score, host team, stadium).

Evidence collected:
1) Direct match for the stated matchup, date, stadium, and score
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score"
  FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
  WHERE LOWER("visiting team") = 'indianapolis colts'
    AND LOWER("host team") = 'new york giants'
    AND date ILIKE '%September 10%';
- Result:
  - date: september 10
  - visiting team: indianapolis colts
  - host team: new york giants
  - stadium: giants stadium
  - final score: 26 - 21

2) Cross-check to ensure no other conflicting September 10 entries involving these teams
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score"
  FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
  WHERE (LOWER("visiting team") LIKE '%colts%' OR LOWER("host team") LIKE '%giants%')
    AND date ILIKE '%September 10%';
- Result (1 row):
  - date: september 10
  - visiting team: indianapolis colts
  - host team: new york giants
  - stadium: giants stadium
  - final score: 26 - 21

Assessment:
- Teams: Indianapolis Colts vs. New York Giants — matches.
- Date: September 10 — matches (year not specified in claim; table stores month/day).
- Stadium: Giants Stadium — matches.
- Final score: 26 - 21 — matches.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data in the authoritative table of NBC Sunday Night Football results (2006–present).

Assumptions made:
- The claim’s singular forms (“colt”, “giant”) refer to the teams (Indianapolis Colts, New York Giants).
- The claim omits the year; the data source records this as a September 10 game consistent with the 2006 Sunday Night Football opener.
