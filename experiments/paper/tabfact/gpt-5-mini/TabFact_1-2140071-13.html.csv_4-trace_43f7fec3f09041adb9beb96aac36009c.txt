What was checked
- Claim interpreted as: “Katie Kansa is the coach for episode 10, which premiered on October 11, 2012, and the record has a full-episode external link.” The relevant data source is the TabFact PostgreSQL database, table public.made_tv_series with columns: season, episode, episode summary, premier date, external link, coach.

Evidence from the data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Is there a row for episode 10 with premier date October 11, 2012?
SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary", "external link"
FROM made_tv_series
WHERE episode = 10 AND "premier date" = 'October 11, 2012';
Result: no rows returned.

2) What does the database show for episode 10?
SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary", "external link"
FROM made_tv_series
WHERE episode = 10
ORDER BY season
LIMIT 100;
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 10
- premier date: october 10 , 2012
- coach: chris
- episode summary: shane is made into a tough mudder
- external link: full episode

3) Which episode has premier date October 11, 2012?
SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary", "external link"
FROM made_tv_series
WHERE "premier date" ILIKE '%october 11%';
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 11
- premier date: october 11 , 2012
- coach: katie kansas
- episode summary: shambre is made into a gogo dancer
- external link: full episode

4) Confirm spelling and coach entry containing “katie”
SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "external link"
FROM public.made_tv_series
WHERE lower(coach) LIKE '%katie%';
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 11
- premier date: october 11 , 2012
- coach: katie kansas
- external link: full episode

Findings
- Coach identity: Episode 10’s coach is “chris,” not “Katie Kansa.” The name that appears in the data is “katie kansas,” and it is associated with episode 11, not episode 10.
- Premiere date: Episode 10 premiered on “october 10 , 2012,” not October 11, 2012. October 11, 2012 corresponds to episode 11.
- External link field: For both episode 10 and episode 11, the external link field is “full episode,” indicating that a full-episode link is recorded in the dataset. The table does not provide a URL; it records the presence as the text “full episode.”

Conclusion
- The claim that Katie Kansa was the coach in episode 10 and that it premiered on October 11, 2012 is contradicted by the data. However, the part about having a “full episode” external link is supported by the record for episode 10.

Assumptions/interpretation
- I interpreted “katie kansa” as the coach’s name. The database records the coach as “katie kansas” (with a final “s”).
- I interpreted “episode 10 premier on october 11 , 2012” as a single episode entry with both conditions (episode number = 10 and premiere date = October 11, 2012). The dataset shows that October 11, 2012 corresponds to episode 11, not episode 10.
