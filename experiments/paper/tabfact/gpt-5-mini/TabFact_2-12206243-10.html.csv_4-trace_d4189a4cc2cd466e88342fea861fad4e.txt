Claim to verify: "september 25 game be against the oriole the final score be 4 - 3 , 28324 fan be in attendance"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source with a single relevant table: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text).

Evidence from data:
- Retrieved the September 25 entry from the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season game log.
- Result row:
  - date: "september 25"
  - opponent: "orioles"
  - score: "4 - 3"
  - attendance: 28324

Executed SQL (as run against public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season):
SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE (date ILIKE '%25%' AND (date ILIKE '%Sep%' OR date ILIKE '%Sept%' OR date ILIKE '%September%'));

Returned result:
[{"date":"september 25","opponent":"orioles","score":"4 - 3","attendance":28324}]

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- "against the oriole" → Supported (opponent = "orioles").
- "the final score be 4 - 3" → Supported (score = "4 - 3").
- "28324 fan be in attendance" → Supported (attendance = 28324).

Conclusion: The claim matches the data in the available database for the September 25 game in the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season.

Assumptions:
- The verification is performed within the scope of the available dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays season). The date field does not include a year; we inferred the context from the table.
- Opponent naming uses lowercase plural ("orioles"); this is treated as equivalent to "Oriole/Orioles" in the user claim.
