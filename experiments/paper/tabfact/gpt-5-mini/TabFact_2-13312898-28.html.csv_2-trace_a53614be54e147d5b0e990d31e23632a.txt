Claim to verify: “More players are drafted from USC than from Clemson.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact17 with a public schema containing table public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history.
- Table schema (from schema inspection): round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text).

Interpretation
- Since the accessible dataset is a single-table history of Indianapolis Colts draft picks, I verify the claim within this dataset: comparing the number of Colts draftees from USC vs Clemson.

Evidence
1) Distinct colleges and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT college, COUNT(*) AS drafted_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college
ORDER BY drafted_count DESC, college ASC
LIMIT 200;
Results (excerpt):
- usc — 2
- clemson — 1

2) Direct side-by-side counts (case-insensitive exact match)
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN trim(lower(college)) = 'usc' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS usc_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN trim(lower(college)) = 'clemson' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clemson_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history;
Results:
- usc_count: 2
- clemson_count: 1

Conclusion
- Within the Indianapolis Colts draft history data, more players were drafted from USC (2) than from Clemson (1). The claim holds true in this dataset.

Assumptions
- Scope: Verification is limited to the available dataset (Indianapolis Colts draft history) and not the entire NFL unless otherwise specified.
- Matching logic: College names compared using case-insensitive exact matches to 'usc' and 'clemson'. Variants like 'University of Southern California' would not be counted unless stored as 'usc' in this table.
