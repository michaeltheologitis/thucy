Claim to verify: "on march 19, 1984, plymouth argyle play derby county"

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Available table: public.t_1983_84_fa_cup (covers 1983–84 FA Cup ties)

Schema (from the data source):
- Table public.t_1983_84_fa_cup columns (all text): "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"

Evidence 1 — Directly check Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County fixtures in 1983–84 FA Cup:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
  FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup
  WHERE ("home team" ILIKE '%Plymouth%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%Derby%')
     OR ("home team" ILIKE '%Derby%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%Plymouth%');
- Result rows:
  1) tie no: 3 | home team: plymouth argyle | score: 0 - 0 | away team: derby county | date: 10 march 1984
  2) tie no: replay | home team: derby county | score: 0 - 1 | away team: plymouth argyle | date: 14 march 1984
- Interpretation: In the FA Cup, Plymouth Argyle and Derby County played on 10 March 1984 and 14 March 1984 (replay), not on 19 March 1984.

Evidence 2 — Check for any 19 March 1984 match in the table:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE "date" ILIKE '%19 March 1984%';
- Result: count = 0
- Interpretation: No 1983–84 FA Cup ties in this table are dated 19 March 1984.

Evidence 3 — List all March 1984 ties for context:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "tie no","home team","score","away team","date"
  FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup
  WHERE "date" ILIKE '%1984%' AND ("date" ILIKE '%Mar%' OR "date" ILIKE '%March%')
  ORDER BY "date";
- Returned rows (ordered by stored text):
  - 10 march 1984: notts county 1 - 2 everton
  - 10 march 1984: plymouth argyle 0 - 0 derby county
  - 10 march 1984: birmingham city 1 - 3 watford
  - 11 march 1984: sheffield wednesday 0 - 0 southampton
  - 14 march 1984: derby county 0 - 1 plymouth argyle (replay)
  - 20 march 1984: southampton 5 - 1 sheffield wednesday (replay)
- Interpretation: The table shows March 10, 11, 14, and 20. There is no entry for March 19, 1984.

Conclusion:
- The available authoritative FA Cup data shows Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County occurred on March 10 and March 14, 1984, not on March 19, 1984. Therefore, the specific date claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim within the scope of the available data (1983–84 FA Cup). League fixtures or other competitions are not available in the connected data sources. Dates are matched as stored text in the table.
