Claim to verify
- The VCA has a weight of 40 t (44.1 tons) and mounts a 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer, while the VCTM has a weight of 26 t (28.7 tons) and mounts a 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL instance functions.postgres_tabfact1 (public schema).
- Schema inspection identified one relevant table: public.tam_tank with columns: vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt (all text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve all rows to inspect VCA 155 and VCTM specifications
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
Key returned values (by column):
- Row 1 (weights)
  - "vca 155": 40t (44.1tons)
  - vctm: 26t (28.7tons)
- Row 2 (armament)
  - "vca 155": 155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer
  - vctm: 120 mm (4.72in) mortar

Assessment
- VCA 155 weight: 40 t (44.1 tons) — matches claim.
- VCA armament: 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer — matches claim.
- VCTM weight: 26 t (28.7 tons) — matches claim.
- VCTM armament: 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar — matches claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data returned from public.tam_tank via the executed SQL.

Assumptions
- “VCA” refers to the VCA 155 variant (column name "vca 155").
- The table encodes different attributes by row (Row 1 = weight, Row 2 = armament), inferred from cell contents.
- “tons” interpreted as short tons, consistent with the provided metric-to-imperial conversions in the data.
