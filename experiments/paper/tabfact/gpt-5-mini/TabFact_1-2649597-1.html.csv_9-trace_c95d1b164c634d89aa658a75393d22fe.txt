Summary conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. In 2001, Shane Hall ran 33 races and recorded 6 DNFs, which is about 18.18% of his races—not half.

Evidence from database queries

1) Verify there is a single 2001 record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2001 FROM public."shane_hall" WHERE year = 2001;
- Result:
  count_2001 = 1

2) Retrieve 2001 races and DNFs and check if DNFs equal half of races
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, races, dnf, (dnf * 2 = races) AS dnf_is_exact_half FROM public."shane_hall" WHERE year = 2001;
- Result:
  year = 2001, races = 33, dnf = 6, dnf_is_exact_half = false
- Interpretation:
  Half of 33 would be 16.5, so 6 is not half.

3) Compute DNF rate (percentage)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, races, dnf, ROUND(100.0 * dnf / NULLIF(races,0), 2) AS dnf_rate_pct
  FROM public."shane_hall"
  WHERE year = 2001;
- Result:
  year = 2001, races = 33, dnf = 6, dnf_rate_pct = 18.18
- Interpretation:
  Shane Hall’s DNF rate in 2001 was 18.18%, far from 50%.

Conclusion: The data shows Shane Hall did not have DNFs in half of his races in 2001. He had 6 DNFs out of 33 starts (18.18%).

Assumptions made:
- “half his race” is interpreted as “DNF in half of his races” during the 2001 season.
- The table public."shane_hall" is an authoritative record for Shane Hall’s 2001 season statistics.
