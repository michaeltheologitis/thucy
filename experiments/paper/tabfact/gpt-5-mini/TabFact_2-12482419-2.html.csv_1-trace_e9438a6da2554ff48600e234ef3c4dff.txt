Summary
- Claim: “the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5 be 0.535”. Interpreted as: among seasons in the available dataset where games-behind (gb) equals 5 exactly, the average win fraction is 0.535.
- Data source explored: TabFact database, table public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons (Nashville Sounds seasons). The win % column stores thousandths (e.g., 535 → 0.535), and gb is text (e.g., '-', '5', '3½').

Data discovery and schema confirmation
1) Schema inspection
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons' AND column_name IN ('win %','gb');
Result:
- win %: bigint
- gb: text

2) Sample rows and value formats
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons LIMIT 20;
Observation: win % appears as integers like 454, 576, 535 (thousandths); gb values include '-', whole numbers (e.g., '5'), and half-games (e.g., '3½').

3) Distinct gb values
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT gb FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons ORDER BY gb LIMIT 50;
Observed distinct gb values include: -, 2, 2½, 3½, 5, 7, 9, 9½, 12, 12½, 13, 15, 16, 17, 19, 20, 22½, 23.

Verification steps and evidence
A) Identify seasons with gb exactly equal to '5'
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, record, "win %", ("win %"::numeric)/1000.0 AS win_fraction
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE gb = '5';
Result:
- 2010 — record: 77 - 67 — win % = 535 — win_fraction = 0.535

B) Compute the count and the average win fraction for gb = '5'
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS season_count, avg(("win %")::numeric/1000.0) AS avg_win_fraction
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE trim(gb) = '5';
Result:
- season_count = 1
- avg_win_fraction = 0.535

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one season with gb = 5, and its win fraction is 0.535. Therefore, the average win percentage (as a fraction) for seasons with gb = 5 in this dataset is 0.535. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “gb of 5” is interpreted as rows where gb equals the exact text '5' (not including half-games like '5½' or alternative formats).
- “average win percentage” refers to the mean of the win fraction values across all matching team-seasons in this table, where win % is stored in thousandths (535 → 0.535).
- Scope is limited to the available dataset (Nashville Sounds seasons in public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons).
