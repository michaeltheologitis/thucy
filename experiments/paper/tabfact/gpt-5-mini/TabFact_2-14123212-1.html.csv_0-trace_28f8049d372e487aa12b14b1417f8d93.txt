Summary conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset (public.whlp), there are exactly 6 Class D FM entries with translator-style callsigns; 3 have frequency mhz values in the 100s (100–109.999 MHz) and 3 have frequency mhz values in the 90s (90–99.999 MHz).

Evidence and executed SQL

1) Inspect distribution of the “class” field
- Purpose: Determine whether entries are of a consistent type that could represent translators.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "class", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.whlp
  GROUP BY "class"
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result:
  class d: 6
  Interpretation: All 6 rows are class "d" in this table.

2) List all rows to see callsigns and frequencies
- Purpose: Confirm entries and their frequency mhz values.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "class", "fcc info" FROM public.whlp;
- Result rows:
  1) call sign: w221by, frequency mhz: 92.1, city of license: elgin , illinois, class: d, fcc info: fcc
  2) call sign: w264bf, frequency mhz: 100.7, city of license: englewood , illinois, class: d, fcc info: fcc
  3) call sign: w240bj, frequency mhz: 95.9, city of license: crown point , indiana, class: d, fcc info: fcc
  4) call sign: w276bm, frequency mhz: 103.1, city of license: park forest , illinois, class: d, fcc info: fcc
  5) call sign: w293al, frequency mhz: 106.5, city of license: rochester , indiana, class: d, fcc info: fcc
  6) call sign: w223au, frequency mhz: 92.5, city of license: south bend , indiana, class: d, fcc info: fcc

3) Count entries by frequency ranges (90s vs 100s MHz)
- Purpose: Verify the exact counts in each frequency decade.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ("frequency mhz")::numeric >= 100 AND ("frequency mhz")::numeric <= 109.999) AS cnt_100_109_999,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ("frequency mhz")::numeric >= 90 AND ("frequency mhz")::numeric <= 99.999) AS cnt_90_99_999
  FROM public.whlp;
- Result:
  cnt_100_109_999 = 3
  cnt_90_99_999 = 3

Conclusion based on data: Within public.whlp, there are three entries with frequency mhz in the 100s and three entries with frequency mhz in the 90s, matching the claim.

Assumptions noted for clarity:
- The term “translator” in the claim is interpreted as the entries in public.whlp, which all have class “d” and translator-style callsigns (e.g., W221BY), commonly used for FM translators. The dataset itself does not include a field explicitly labeled “translator,” so this interpretation is based on the structure of the table and values present.
