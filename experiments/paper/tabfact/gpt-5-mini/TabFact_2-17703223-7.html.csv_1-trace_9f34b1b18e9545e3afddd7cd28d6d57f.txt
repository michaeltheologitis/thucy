Claim to verify: “there be only 1 person with a snatch of 153.0 and his total bodyweight be 104.70.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) exposing schema public.

Schema used:
- Table: public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
  Columns:
  - name (text)
  - bodyweight (double precision)
  - snatch (text)
  - clean & jerk (text)
  - total (kg) (text)

Evidence 1: List athlete(s) with snatch = 153.0 (numeric comparison)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch
FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
WHERE regexp_replace(snatch,'[^0-9\.]','','g') ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
  AND (regexp_replace(snatch,'[^0-9\.]','','g'))::numeric = 153.0;
- Result:
  - christian lópez ( gua ), bodyweight: 104.7, snatch: "153.0"

Evidence 2: Count distinct athletes with snatch = 153.0 (numeric comparison)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS distinct_athlete_count
FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
WHERE (NULLIF(trim(snatch), '-'))::numeric = 153.0;
- Result: distinct_athlete_count = 1
- Supporting inspection of snatch values (to justify numeric casting):
  - Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT snatch FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games ORDER BY snatch LIMIT 200;
  - Result sample: "-", "140.0", "150.0", "151.0", "153.0", "157.0", "160.0", "175.0"

Evidence 3: Verify that athlete’s bodyweight equals 104.70 exactly
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch,
       (bodyweight = 104.70) AS bodyweight_equals_104_70
FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
WHERE (CASE WHEN trim(snatch) ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN trim(snatch)::double precision ELSE NULL END) = 153.0;
- Result:
  - name: christian lópez ( gua ), bodyweight: 104.7, snatch: 153.0, bodyweight_equals_104_70: true

Conclusion:
- The database shows exactly one athlete with a snatch of 153.0 kg. That athlete’s recorded bodyweight is 104.7 kg, which equals 104.70 when expressed to two decimal places. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “total bodyweight” is interpreted as the athlete’s bodyweight (kg) field in the table, not the “total (kg)” competition result.
- The only available authoritative dataset is public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games; verification is scoped to this data.
- The snatch column is stored as text; numeric comparisons were performed by safely casting numeric-looking values and treating “-” as missing.
