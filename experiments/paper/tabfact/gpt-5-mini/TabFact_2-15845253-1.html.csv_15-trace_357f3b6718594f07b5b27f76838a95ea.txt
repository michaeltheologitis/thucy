Claim assessed: “9 of the viral disease replicate outside the nucleus.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: Postgres database TabFact (postgres_tabfact3)
- Table used: public.viral_disease
- Relevant column: "replication site" (text)

Schema details (from tool inspection)
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)
- Primary key: none

Evidence
1) Distinct replication sites and counts
SQL:
SELECT "replication site", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "replication site"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "replication site" ASC;
Result:
- replication site = cytoplasm — 14 rows
- replication site = nucleus — 9 rows

2) Direct counts for outside-the-nucleus vs nucleus
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cytoplasm_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';
Result: cytoplasm_count = 14

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nucleus_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
Result: nucleus_count = 9

Conclusion
- The data show 14 entries replicate in the cytoplasm (i.e., outside the nucleus) and 9 replicate in the nucleus. Therefore, the statement that 9 replicate outside the nucleus is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Outside the nucleus” is interpreted as replication site = “cytoplasm.”
- Each row in public.viral_disease represents a distinct viral entity relevant to the claim (family/disease) within this dataset.
