What I checked
- I explored the available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs. This table contains a seasons column listing the seasons each entry participated in.

Schema context
- Table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  Columns: no (text), football club (text), continent (text), associated football club (text), seasons (text), racing drivers (text)

Evidence 1: Do “team brazil”, “team australia”, and “team england” have season 2011?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "football club", seasons
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%'
     OR "football club" ILIKE '%Australia%'
     OR "football club" ILIKE '%England%';
- Result:
  - team brazil — 2011
  - team australia — 2011
  - team england — 2011

Evidence 2: Are these teams among all entries that include season 2011?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "football club", seasons FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE seasons LIKE '%2011%' ORDER BY "football club";
- Result (9 entries):
  - ac sparta prague — 2011
  - rsc anderlecht — 2008 2009 2010 2011
  - team australia — 2011
  - team brazil — 2011
  - team england — 2011
  - team japan — 2011
  - team luxembourg — 2011
  - team netherlands — 2011
  - team new zealand — 2011

Conclusion
- The data shows that “team brazil,” “team australia,” and “team england” all have seasons listed as 2011 and are among the entries that participated in 2011. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “club that participate in the 2011 season” as entries in public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs whose seasons field contains “2011.”
- Matching of team names was case-insensitive substring matching in the "football club" column.
