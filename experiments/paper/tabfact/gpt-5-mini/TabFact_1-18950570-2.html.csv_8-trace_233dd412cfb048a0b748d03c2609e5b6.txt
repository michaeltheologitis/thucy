Claim to verify: “In the period where there are 1,086,000 deaths per year, the CDR is 22.6.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table
  - Key columns: period; live births per year; deaths per year; cbr (crude birth rate); cdr (crude death rate); etc.

Evidence gathered
1) Direct search for an exact 1,086,000 deaths per year match
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, "deaths per year", cdr
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE ("deaths per year")::numeric = 1086000;
- Executed SQL (match count):
  SELECT count(*) AS matches
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE ("deaths per year")::numeric = 1086000;
- Result: 0 rows matched (casting failed to find an exact numeric match, likely due to formatting in the source column).

2) Robust search allowing for formatted numbers (e.g., spaces as thousands separators) and range check around 1,086,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "period", "deaths per year", "cdr"
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE (regexp_replace("deaths per year",'[^0-9.-]','','g'))::numeric BETWEEN 1080000 AND 1090000
  ORDER BY "period";
- Result: 1 matching row
  - period: 1995 - 2000
  - deaths per year: 1 086 000
  - cdr: 6.5

3) Check whether any row has CDR = 22.6
- Executed SQL (exact match count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE cdr = 22.6;
- Result: 0
- Executed SQL (inspect distinct CDR values):
  SELECT DISTINCT cdr FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY cdr LIMIT 100;
- Result (excerpt): 6.4, 6.5, 6.8, 7.4, 8.2, 9, 9.9, 11.1, 12.6, 14, 15.5
- Observation: 22.6 does not appear as a CDR value in the table.

Conclusion
- The period associated with 1,086,000 deaths per year is 1995 - 2000, and the recorded crude death rate (cdr) for that row is 6.5, not 22.6.
- Additionally, no rows in the dataset have cdr = 22.6 at all.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “1086000 death per year” refers to the table’s “deaths per year” value, allowing for thousands separators (e.g., “1 086 000”).
- “cdr” refers to the table’s “cdr (crude death rate)” column.
- The claim pertains to the data contained in public.my_info_table within the discovered TabFact database.
