Claim to verify: “13 viral family have an helical virion shape.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.viral_disease with columns:
  - family (text)
  - baltimore group (text)
  - envelopment (text)
  - virion shape (text)
  - replication site (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct values and counts for virion shape
SQL:
SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY "virion shape" ORDER BY count DESC, "virion shape";
Result:
- icosahedral: 13
- helical: 6
- complex: 2
- helical , bullet shaped: 1
- spherical: 1

Total rows in table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.viral_disease;
Result:
- total_rows: 23

2) Distinct families overall
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count FROM public.viral_disease;
Result:
- distinct_family_count = 23

3) Families and their virion shape(s)
SQL:
SELECT family, STRING_AGG(DISTINCT COALESCE("virion shape", ''), ', ' ORDER BY COALESCE("virion shape", '')) AS virion_shapes
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY family
ORDER BY family;
Result (family -> virion_shapes):
- adenoviridae -> icosahedral
- arenaviridae -> helical
- astroviridae -> icosahedral
- bunyaviridae -> helical
- caliciviridae -> icosahedral
- coronaviridae -> helical
- filoviridae -> helical
- flaviviridae -> icosahedral
- hepadnaviridae -> icosahedral
- hepeviridae -> icosahedral
- herpesviridae -> complex
- orthomyxoviridae -> helical
- papillomaviridae -> icosahedral
- paramyxoviridae -> helical
- parvoviridae -> icosahedral
- picornaviridae -> icosahedral
- polyomaviridae -> icosahedral
- poxviridae -> complex
- reoviridae -> icosahedral
- retroviridae -> icosahedral
- rhabdoviridae -> helical , bullet shaped
- togaviridae -> icosahedral
- unassigned -> spherical

4) Count families with helical virion shape (exact vs. contains)
- Exact match (virion shape = 'helical')
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS count_exact_helical FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'helical';
  Result: count_exact_helical = 6
  SQL (to list families):
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'helical' ORDER BY family;
  Result: arenaviridae, bunyaviridae, coronaviridae, filoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae

- Case-insensitive substring match (virion shape contains 'helical')
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS count_like_helical FROM public.viral_disease WHERE lower("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';
  Result: count_like_helical = 7
  SQL (to list families):
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE lower("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%' ORDER BY family;
  Result: arenaviridae, bunyaviridae, coronaviridae, filoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, rhabdoviridae

Conclusion
- The dataset lists 23 distinct viral families. Only 6 families have virion shape exactly labeled “helical,” and 7 families contain “helical” in their virion shape description (including “helical , bullet shaped” for rhabdoviridae). Both counts are well below 13. Therefore, the claim that 13 viral families have a helical virion shape is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Viral family” corresponds to the family column in public.viral_disease.
- “Helical virion shape” is interpreted primarily via the virion shape column. I reported both exact matches to “helical” and a broader count including any description containing “helical.”
