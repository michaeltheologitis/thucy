Finding: The available data shows exactly 1 viral disease entry with a spherical virion shape.

Evidence from the TabFact (postgres_tabfact19) database, table public.viral_disease:

1) Distinct virion shape values and their counts
- SQL:
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  GROUP BY "virion shape"
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result summary:
  - icosahedral: 13
  - helical: 6
  - complex: 2
  - spherical: 1
  - helical , bullet shaped: 1

2) Direct count of entries with spherical virion shape
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_spherical
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'spherical';
- Result: count_spherical = 1

Conclusion: The claim “only 1 of the viral disease have a spherical virion shape” is supported by the data in the public.viral_disease table.

Assumptions:
- “Viral disease” refers to each row in public.viral_disease.
- “Spherical virion shape” corresponds to the exact string value 'spherical' in the "virion shape" column.
- Verification is limited to the connected TabFact database and its public.viral_disease table.
