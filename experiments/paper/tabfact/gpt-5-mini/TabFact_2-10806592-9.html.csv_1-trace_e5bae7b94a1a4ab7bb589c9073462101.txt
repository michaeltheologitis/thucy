Claim to verify: “there be no home team that score less than 11.” Interpreted as: In the available dataset, no home team’s total points are below 11.

Data source discovery:
- Found one database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public, table: public.t_1938_vfl_season.

Schema (public.t_1938_vfl_season):
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).
- Scores are stored as text in the format goals.behinds (total), e.g., "11.5 (71)"; the number in parentheses is the total points.

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows and table size
- SQL: SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season LIMIT 20;
  Result (6 rows total available):
  1) geelong | 11.23 (89) | hawthorn | 6.13 (49)
  2) fitzroy | 16.12 (108) | south melbourne | 8.8 (56)
  3) st kilda | 14.12 (96) | melbourne | 16.16 (112)
  4) richmond | 15.14 (104) | essendon | 15.9 (99)
  5) footscray | 13.9 (87) | collingwood | 10.5 (65)
  6) north melbourne | 11.5 (71) | carlton | 16.25 (121)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
  Result: total_rows = 6

2) Minimum home-team total points (extract the number inside parentheses and cast to integer)
- SQL: SELECT MIN(CAST(trim(trailing ')' FROM split_part("home team score",'(',2)) AS integer)) AS min_home_points FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
  Result: min_home_points = 71

3) Check for any home scores below 11 points
- SQL: SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","date", CAST(trim(trailing ')' FROM split_part("home team score",'(',2)) AS integer) AS home_points FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season WHERE CAST(trim(trailing ')' FROM split_part("home team score",'(',2)) AS integer) < 11 ORDER BY date;
  Result: No rows returned

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (public.t_1938_vfl_season, 6 matches), no home team has a total score below 11 points. The minimum observed home score is 71. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “score” refers to total points, taken as the integer inside parentheses in the "home team score" field (format goals.behinds (total)).
- Verification is scoped to the discovered dataset (TabFact.public.t_1938_vfl_season), which contains 6 rows.
