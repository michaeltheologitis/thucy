Claim to verify: “the highest attendance be at the target center.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema) with table t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.

Schema (from discovery)
- Table: t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text)

Evidence collection
1) Inspect sample rows and row count
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
ORDER BY game
LIMIT 10;

SELECT count(*) AS total_rows
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season;

Key rows observed (8 total rows):
- game 77: location attendance = "american airlines center 20301"
- game 80: location attendance = "target center 18478"
- Several US Airways Center rows at 18422, etc.; one row missing an attendance number.

2) Compute the maximum attendance and identify its venue
Executed SQL (compute max parsed attendance):
SELECT MAX( (replace(substring(trim("location attendance") FROM '([0-9,]+)$'), ',', '') )::int ) AS max_att
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE substring(trim("location attendance") FROM '([0-9,]+)$') IS NOT NULL;

Result:
- max_att = 20301

Executed SQL (rows at that maximum, extracting venue):
SELECT game, date, team,
       trim(regexp_replace(trim("location attendance"), '([[:space:]]*[0-9,]+)$','')) AS venue,
       (replace(substring(trim("location attendance") FROM '([0-9,]+)$'), ',', '') )::int AS attendance,
       "location attendance"
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE (replace(substring(trim("location attendance") FROM '([0-9,]+)$'), ',', '') )::int = 20301
ORDER BY game;

Result:
- game 77, date: april 5, team: dallas, venue: american airlines center, attendance: 20301

3) Context: full ordered list by attendance and Target Center’s rank
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team,
       trim(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[0-9].*$', '')) AS venue,
       regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]+', '', 'g')::int AS attendance
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]+', '', 'g') <> ''
ORDER BY attendance DESC;

Top results (desc):
- 20301 — american airlines center (game 77)
- 18478 — target center (game 80)
- 18422 — us airways center (multiple games)
- 17781 — new orleans arena
- 15908 — fedexforum

Conclusion
- The highest attendance in the available data is 20301 at American Airlines Center, not at Target Center (18478). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Highest attendance” refers to the maximum attendance value parsed from the "location attendance" field within this specific table.
- Attendance was parsed as the trailing digits in the field; rows without a trailing number were excluded from max computations.
