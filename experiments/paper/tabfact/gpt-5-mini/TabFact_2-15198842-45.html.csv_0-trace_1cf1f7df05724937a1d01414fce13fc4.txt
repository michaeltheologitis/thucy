Claim interpreted: Within the available Atlanta Falcons draft history dataset, the only player recorded with position “defensive tackle” is Corey Peters, and his round-specific pick number is 19.

What I checked
- Verified Corey Peters’ row (name, position, pick).
- Verified how many players are listed as “defensive tackle.”
- Verified whether any “defensive tackle” besides Corey Peters has pick = 19.

Evidence from the database
1) Find Corey Peters and confirm position and pick
SQL executed:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history
WHERE name ILIKE 'corey peter%' OR name ILIKE 'corey peters%';
Result:
- round: 3; pick: 19; overall: 83; name: corey peters; position: defensive tackle; college: kentucky

2) Count how many players have position = 'defensive tackle' and list them
SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_defensive_tackle
FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history
WHERE lower(position) = 'defensive tackle';
Result: 1

SQL executed (list):
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, college
FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history
WHERE lower(position) = 'defensive tackle'
ORDER BY overall;
Result:
- round: 3; pick: 19; overall: 83; name: corey peters; college: kentucky

3) Check for any other defensive tackle with pick = 19
SQL executed:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, college
FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history
WHERE position = 'defensive tackle' AND pick = 19;
Result: 1 row (corey peters, round 3, pick 19, overall 83, kentucky)

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one “defensive tackle,” and it is Corey Peters.
- Corey Peters’ round-specific pick number (pick) is 19.
Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Pick number” refers to the round-specific pick column (pick), not the overall draft position (overall = 83 for Corey Peters).
- “Corey Peter” is interpreted as Corey Peters (the dataset row is stored as “corey peters”).
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history).
