Claim to verify: “In season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the most viewed episode of the season is titled ‘gary and allison brook.’”

Summary of findings:
- The public.gary_unmarried table contains 20 rows, matching the 20 episodes of Season 1 (airing Sep 2008–May 2009).
- The highest “viewers” value in the table is 8.14.
- The episode with 8.14 million viewers is titled “gary and allison brooks” (plural), not “brook.”
- Therefore, the substance of the claim (that this episode is the most viewed of Season 1) is correct, but the episode title is slightly misstated by one letter.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inventory check of episodes (to confirm Season 1 range and presence of the cited title)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "air date", viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried ORDER BY "air date" ASC;
- Result excerpt (showing relevant entries):
  • episode: pilot — air date: september 24 , 2008 — viewers: 6.84
  • episode: gary and allison brooks — air date: november 19 , 2008 — viewers: 8.14
  • episode: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal — air date: may 20 , 2009 — viewers: 5.55
  (Full result contained 20 rows ranging Sep 2008–May 2009.)

2) Identify the most-viewed episodes
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried ORDER BY viewers DESC LIMIT 3;
- Results:
  1) episode: "gary and allison brooks" — viewers: 8.14
  2) episode: "gary goes first" — viewers: 8.03
  3) episode: "gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend" — viewers: 7.85

3) Confirm uniqueness of the maximum viewership and the episode title
- Executed SQL (max value):
  SELECT MAX(viewers) AS max_viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried;
- Result: max_viewers = 8.14

- Executed SQL (episode(s) at max):
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE viewers = (SELECT MAX(viewers) FROM public.gary_unmarried);
- Result: episode = "gary and allison brooks", viewers = 8.14

4) Row count (to corroborate Season 1 scope)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.gary_unmarried;
- Result: count = 20

Conclusion:
- The most viewed Season 1 episode is “gary and allison brooks” with 8.14 million viewers. The user’s title “gary and allison brook” is off by one letter. The underlying claim about which episode was most viewed is supported by the data, but the title is slightly inaccurate.

Assumptions:
- The table public.gary_unmarried represents all episodes of Season 1 (supported by count=20 and air dates from Sep 2008–May 2009). 
- “viewers” represents total U.S. viewers in millions, as commonly reported for TV episode ratings.
