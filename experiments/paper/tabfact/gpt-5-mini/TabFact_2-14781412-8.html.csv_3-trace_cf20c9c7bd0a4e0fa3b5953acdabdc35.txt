Claim interpreted: “The gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every year the event occurred.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact30)
- Table used: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games
  - Columns: year (bigint), location (text), gold (text), silver (text), bronze (text)

Step 1 — Inspect all recorded editions and gold medalists
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
Results:
1) 1982 — New Delhi — gold: nadia al - moutawaa
2) 1986 — Seoul — gold: takashi tomura
3) 1994 — Hiroshima — gold: konoshin kuwahara
4) 1998 — Bangkok — gold: jin kanno
5) 2002 — Busan — gold: mikaela marãda jaworski
6) 2006 — Doha — gold: ali yousuf al - rumaihi
7) 2010 — Guangzhou — gold: ramzy al duhami

Step 2 — Check for any repeated gold medalists across years
2a) Total rows (context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
Result: 7

2b) Look for gold names that occur more than once (duplicates)
Executed SQL:
SELECT gold, COUNT(*) as occurrences, array_agg(year ORDER BY year) as years
FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games
WHERE gold IS NOT NULL AND gold <> ''
GROUP BY gold
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY occurrences DESC, gold;
Result: [] (no duplicates)

2c) Show occurrences for each gold medalist
Executed SQL:
SELECT gold, COUNT(*) AS occurrences
FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games
WHERE gold IS NOT NULL AND gold <> ''
GROUP BY gold
ORDER BY occurrences DESC, gold;
Result: each listed gold medalist has occurrences = 1

Step 3 — Cross-check: editions vs. distinct gold medalists
3a) Count editions
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS editions FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
Result: editions = 7

3b) Count distinct gold medalists
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT gold) AS distinct_gold FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE gold IS NOT NULL;
Result: distinct_gold = 7

Conclusion
- The number of distinct gold medalists equals the number of recorded editions (7), and no gold medalist appears more than once in the table. Based on the available authoritative dataset, the gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has indeed been different in every edition recorded.

Assumptions
- I interpret “equestrian at the Asian Games” as represented by the single table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games, which lists one gold medalist per recorded edition (1982–2010 in this dataset).
- Names are treated as distinct based on the exact text stored; no normalization of spelling/diacritics was applied.
- The verification is bounded by the editions present in the dataset (through 2010).
