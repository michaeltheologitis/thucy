Claim interpreted: “4 of the competitions are senior world championships.” I interpret “senior world championship” as entries where competition = 'world championships' (excluding junior categories).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), public schema.
- Tables: public.luk_melich (year bigint, competition text, venue text, position text, notes text).

Schema inspection evidence:
- Tool: schema_query
- Result summary: Single table public.luk_melich with columns year, competition, venue, position, notes; no keys.

Evidence 1 — Distinct competitions and counts:
Executed SQL:
SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.luk_melich
GROUP BY competition
ORDER BY count DESC, competition;
Result:
- world championships: 3
- olympic games: 2
- european championships: 1
- european junior championships: 1
- european u23 championships: 1
- universiade: 1
- world junior championships: 1

Evidence 2 — Senior World Championships entries (count and details):
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.luk_melich WHERE lower(competition) = 'world championships';
Result: cnt = 3

Executed SQL (details):
SELECT year, venue, position FROM public.luk_melich WHERE lower(competition) = 'world championships' ORDER BY year NULLS LAST, venue, position;
Results:
- 2005 — helsinki , finland — 14th
- 2009 — berlin , germany — 14th
- 2013 — moscow , russia — 3rd

Evidence 3 — All “world”-level competitions (to differentiate junior vs senior):
Executed SQL (rows):
SELECT year, competition FROM public.luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%world%' ORDER BY competition, year;
Results:
- world championships — 2005
- world championships — 2009
- world championships — 2013
- world junior championships — 1998

Executed SQL (grouped counts):
SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%world%' GROUP BY competition ORDER BY count DESC, competition;
Results:
- world championships — 3
- world junior championships — 1

Assessment:
- Senior world championships entries = 3, not 4. Including juniors would total 4 “world”-level entries, but the claim specifies senior.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Senior world championship” corresponds to rows with competition exactly labeled 'world championships'.
- The phrase “4 of the competition be” is interpreted as “there are four entries in the competition column that are senior world championships.”
