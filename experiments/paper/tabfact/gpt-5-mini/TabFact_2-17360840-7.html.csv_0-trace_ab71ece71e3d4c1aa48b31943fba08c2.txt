Assessment
- The only game in the available data with opponent "buffalo sabres" has attendance 15,611, not 10,750.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750” is not supported by the data. The recorded attendance is 15,611 for the Buffalo Sabres game found in this dataset.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (2008–09 Tampa Bay Lightning season table). The opponent name was treated case-insensitively and corrected to the plural form “Buffalo Sabres.” No other tables in the accessible schema included relevant attendance/opponent fields, so verification is limited to this dataset.
