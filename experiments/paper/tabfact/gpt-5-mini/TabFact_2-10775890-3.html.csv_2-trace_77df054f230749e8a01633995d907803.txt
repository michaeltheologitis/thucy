Claim to verify:
On May 7, 1960, the crowd was larger than 23,135 for a match where the away team scored 3.8 (26) and the home team scored 5.12 (42).

Data sources explored
- Discovered one relational data source (TabFact / public schema) with a table named t_1960_vfl_season that appears to list matches, including home/away teams, scores, venue, crowd (attendance), and date.
- Schema inspection shows relevant columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

Evidence from database (with the exact executed SQL)
1) Understand how dates are stored
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_1960_vfl_season ORDER BY date;
Result:
[ { "date": "7 may 1960" } ]

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_count FROM t_1960_vfl_season;
Result:
[ { "distinct_count": 1 } ]
Interpretation: All rows in this table use the lowercase text date "7 may 1960" (likely all matches from that round/day).

2) Inspect all rows (to see matches on that date)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_1960_vfl_season ORDER BY "date";
Result (abridged to show all rows returned by the tool):
[
 {"away team":"richmond","away team score":"3.8 (26)","crowd":9000,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"north melbourne","home team score":"5.12 (42)","venue":"arden street oval"},
 {"away team":"south melbourne","away team score":"6.10 (46)","crowd":23135,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"melbourne","home team score":"16.14 (110)","venue":"mcg"},
 {"away team":"geelong","away team score":"8.7 (55)","crowd":13802,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"fitzroy","home team score":"5.11 (41)","venue":"brunswick street oval"},
 {"away team":"footscray","away team score":"6.17 (53)","crowd":16000,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"hawthorn","home team score":"6.9 (45)","venue":"glenferrie oval"},
 {"away team":"collingwood","away team score":"11.8 (74)","crowd":30000,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"essendon","home team score":"11.10 (76)","venue":"windy hill"},
 {"away team":"carlton","away team score":"7.3 (45)","crowd":18700,"date":"7 may 1960","home team":"st kilda","home team score":"5.11 (41)","venue":"junction oval"}
]
Observation: The match with the specified scores exists and has crowd 9000.

3) Retrieve the specific match with the given scores on that date
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM t_1960_vfl_season
WHERE date = '7 may 1960'
  AND "away team score" = '3.8 (26)'
  AND "home team score" = '5.12 (42)';
Result:
{ "home team": "north melbourne", "home team score": "5.12 (42)", "away team": "richmond", "away team score": "3.8 (26)", "venue": "arden street oval", "crowd": 9000, "date": "7 may 1960" }

4) Confirm uniqueness of that scoreline on that date
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_1960_vfl_season WHERE date = '7 may 1960' AND "home team score" = '5.12 (42)' AND "away team score" = '3.8 (26)';
Result:
count = 1

5) Directly test the crowd against 23,135 for that match
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", crowd, venue, "date",
CASE WHEN crowd > 23135 THEN true ELSE false END AS greater_than_23135
FROM t_1960_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '7 may 1960'
  AND "home team score" = '5.12 (42)'
  AND "away team score" = '3.8 (26)';
Result:
[{"away team":"richmond","away team score":"3.8 (26)","crowd":9000,"date":"7 may 1960","greater_than_23135":false,"home team":"north melbourne","home team score":"5.12 (42)","venue":"arden street oval"}]

Conclusion
- The match in question (North Melbourne vs Richmond at Arden Street Oval on 7 May 1960, scores 5.12 (42) vs 3.8 (26)) had a recorded crowd of 9,000.
- 9,000 is not larger than 23,135. Therefore, the claim that the crowd was larger than 23,135 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to VFL matches on 7 May 1960, which aligns with the table contents.
- Dates are stored in lowercase text ("7 may 1960"); queries used exact string matching to that stored form.
- The provided table is authoritative for the 1960 VFL round covered and contains all matches for that date.
