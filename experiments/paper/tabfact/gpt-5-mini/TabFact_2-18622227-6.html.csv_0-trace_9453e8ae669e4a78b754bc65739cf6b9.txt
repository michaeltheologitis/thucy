Claim: “the australian open and the french open have the same result in 1996 and 1990.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.katrina_adams
- Relevant columns: tournament (text), year columns including "1990" and "1996" (text)

Evidence retrieved (executed SQL and results)
1) SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1990", "1996" FROM public.katrina_adams ORDER BY tournament;
Results (subset relevant to the claim):
- tournament: australian open | 1990: 3r | 1996: a
- tournament: french open    | 1990: 3r | 1996: qf

2) SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1990", "1996" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open');
Results:
- australian open: 1990 = 3r, 1996 = a
- french open:     1990 = 3r, 1996 = qf

Assessment
- 1990 comparison (australian open vs french open): 3r vs 3r → Same (True)
- 1996 comparison (australian open vs french open): a vs qf → Not the same (False)

Conclusion
- The claim states that the Australian Open and the French Open have the same result in both 1996 and 1990. The data shows they match in 1990 but not in 1996. Therefore, the overall claim is not fully correct.

Assumptions
- “Result” refers to the entries in the katrina_adams table for the tournaments “australian open” and “french open,” which record Katrina Adams’s performance (e.g., 3r = third round, qf = quarterfinal, a = absent) by year.
- Tournament names are stored in lowercase as shown in the table.
