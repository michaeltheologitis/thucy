Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the schema to ground the verification in real data.
- Queried the constituency numbers for Datia and Gohad from the available table.
- Computed the numeric difference between the two constituency numbers.

Data discovery and schema
- Available source: PostgreSQL database postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact), schema public.
- Table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  Columns:
  • "constituency number" (text)
  • "name" (text)
  • "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" (text)
  • "district" (text)
  • "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Retrieve constituency numbers for Datia and Gohad
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Datia%' OR "name" ILIKE '%Gohad%';
Results:
- { "name": "gohad", "constituency number": "13" }
- { "name": "datia", "constituency number": "22" }

2) Compute the numeric difference (Datia − Gohad)
Executed SQL:
SELECT
CAST((SELECT "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "name"='datia') AS integer)
-
CAST((SELECT "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "name"='gohad') AS integer)
AS difference;
Result:
- { "difference": 9 }

Conclusion
- Datia’s constituency number is 22 and Gohad’s is 13. The difference (22 − 13) equals 9, confirming the claim that Datia’s constituency number is higher than Gohad’s by 9.

Assumptions
- “Constituency number” refers to the column "constituency number" in public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency.
- The names “datia” and “gohad” in the table match the entities in the claim; the table stores them in lowercase.
- Casting the text-based constituency numbers to integers for arithmetic is appropriate.
