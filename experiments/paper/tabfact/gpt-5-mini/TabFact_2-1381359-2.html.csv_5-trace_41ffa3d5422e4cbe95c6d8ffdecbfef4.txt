Claim to verify: “2010 - 11 detail season have a runner - up of tokai, and a title of 47th.”

Data source discovery:
- Connected source: TabFact Postgres database (postgres_tabfact17)
- Relevant table: public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
  - Columns: title (text), season (text), winner (text), score (text), "runner - up" (text), venue (text), attendance (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate the 2010–11 season entry and check title and runner-up
SQL:
SELECT season, title, "runner - up" FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE season LIKE '%2010%';
Result:
- season: 2010 - 11 details
- title: 47th
- runner - up: waseda

2) Confirm exact match on the season string
SQL:
SELECT title, "runner - up" FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE season = '2010 - 11 details';
Result:
- title: 47th
- runner - up: waseda

3) Check whether any season lists Tokai as runner-up (context for potential confusion)
SQL:
SELECT season, title, winner, "runner - up", score FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE "runner - up" ILIKE '%tokai%';
Result:
- season: 2009 - 10 details; title: 46th; winner: teikyo; runner - up: tokai; score: 14 - 13

Assessment:
- Title for 2010 - 11: 47th — Supported by the data.
- Runner-up for 2010 - 11: Tokai — Contradicted by the data (runner-up is Waseda). Tokai was runner-up in 2009 - 10 (46th), not in 2010 - 11.

Conclusion: The claim mixes one correct detail (title = 47th) with an incorrect one (runner-up = Tokai). Overall, it is not fully accurate.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “2010 - 11 detail season” as the row with season value “2010 - 11 details” in the table.
- Used case-insensitive match for searching runner-up values containing “Tokai.”
