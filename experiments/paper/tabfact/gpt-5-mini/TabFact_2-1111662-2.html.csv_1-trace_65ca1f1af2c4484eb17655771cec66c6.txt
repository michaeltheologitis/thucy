Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad are the athletes associated with the javelin throw event.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.memorial_van_damme with columns (event, record, athlete, nationality, date).

Schema context:
- memorial_van_damme appears to list events and associated athletes/records for the Memorial Van Damme athletics meeting.

Evidence collected:
1) Confirm the presence of a javelin event
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT event FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE '%javelin%';
- Result:
  javelin throw
- Interpretation: The table includes a javelin throw event.

2) Search for rows mentioning Whitbread or Hattestad
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, event, record, nationality, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Whitbread%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Hattestad%';
- Result (one row):
  athlete: "fatima whitbread trine hattestad"
  event: "javelin throw"
  record: "72.18 m ( old design ) 67.76 m ( current design )"
  nationality: "united kingdom norway"
  date: "5 september 1986 25 august 2000"
- Interpretation: The athlete field explicitly contains both names together for the javelin throw event.

3) Retrieve the full javelin row for completeness
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE lower(event) LIKE '%javelin%';
- Result (full row):
  { event: "javelin throw", record: "72.18 m ( old design ) 67.76 m ( current design )", athlete: "fatima whitbread trine hattestad", nationality: "united kingdom norway", date: "5 september 1986 25 august 2000" }
- Interpretation: This confirms that Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad are the athletes associated with the javelin throw event in this table (likely representing successive records under old and current javelin designs).

Conclusion:
- The data directly lists both "fatima whitbread" and "trine hattestad" as the athletes for the "javelin throw" event in the memorial_van_damme table. This supports the claim.

Assumptions noted:
- I interpret the claim as referring to the athletes associated with the javelin throw event as represented in the available TabFact memorial_van_damme table (not necessarily an exhaustive statement about all competitions). The table consolidates multiple athletes and details into a single row for this event.
