Claim being checked: "on march 10, vince carter (43) have high point and alvin williams (9) have high assist."

Data source overview:
- Available dataset: TabFact public schema, table: public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high assists (text)

Step 1 — Check March 10 entry in the 2001–02 Raptors season
Executed SQL:
SELECT "date", team, score, "high points", "high assists"
FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season
WHERE "date" ILIKE '%March 10%';
Result:
- date: march 10; team: orlando; score: l 79 - 92 (ot); high points: vince carter (16); high assists: chris childs (7)
Finding: On March 10 of this season, Vince Carter’s high points were 16 (not 43), and the high assists were by Chris Childs with 7 (not Alvin Williams with 9).

Step 2 — Check if the combination "vince carter (43)" and "alvin williams (9)" occurs on any date in this season (to identify possible date confusion)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent_team, score, "high points", "high assists"
FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season
WHERE "high points" = 'vince carter (43)'
  AND "high assists" = 'alvin williams (9)';
Result:
- date: march 5; opponent_team: houston; score: l 109 - 112 (ot); high points: vince carter (43); high assists: alvin williams (9)
Executed SQL (count confirmation):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season
WHERE "high points" = 'vince carter (43)'
  AND "high assists" = 'alvin williams (9)';
Result: match_count = 1
Finding: The exact stat combination appears on March 5 (vs. Houston), not March 10.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data for March 10. While the combination did occur on March 5, it did not occur on March 10 in the 2001–02 season data.

Assumptions:
- “On March 10” is interpreted within the available 2001–02 Toronto Raptors season dataset.
- “High point” and “high assist” refer to the table’s “high points” and “high assists” leader entries for that game.
- The “team” column represents the opponent for that game.
