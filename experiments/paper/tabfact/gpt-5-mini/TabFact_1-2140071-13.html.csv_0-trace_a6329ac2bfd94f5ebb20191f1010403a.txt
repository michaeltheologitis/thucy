Overview
- Interpreted claim: “Katie Kansa(s) — coach — 1 episode.” I searched authoritative tabular data for any coach named like “Katie Kansas/Kansa/Katie” and verified the number of episodes they appear in.

Data source exploration
- Available source discovered: TabFact (postgres_tabfact31) database, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.made_tv_series (columns: season, episode, episode summary, premier date, external link, coach). This appears to catalog coaches for episodes of the TV series “Made.”

Evidence
1) Retrieve any rows where coach resembles “kansa/kansas/katie”
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, coach, "episode summary"
FROM public.made_tv_series
WHERE coach ILIKE '%kansa%' OR coach ILIKE '%kansas%' OR coach ILIKE '%katie%'
ORDER BY season, episode;

Result:
- season: 13, episode: 11, coach: katie kansas, episode summary: shambre is made into a gogo dancer

2) Count distinct episodes per matching coach
Executed SQL:
SELECT coach, COUNT(DISTINCT (season, episode)) AS distinct_episode_count
FROM public.made_tv_series
WHERE coach ILIKE '%kansa%' OR coach ILIKE '%kansas%' OR coach ILIKE '%katie%'
GROUP BY coach
ORDER BY distinct_episode_count DESC, coach;

Result:
- coach: katie kansas, distinct_episode_count: 1

Conclusion
- The data shows a coach named “katie kansas” appears in exactly 1 distinct episode (Season 13, Episode 11) of the Made TV series. This supports the claim “katie kansa coach 1 episode.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the MTV series “Made,” given the table name made_tv_series.
- Case-insensitive substring matching is appropriate for handling the query text “kansa/kansas/katie.”
- An episode is uniquely identified by the (season, episode) pair in this dataset.
