Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that the 2nd leg score for the year 2004 was “4 - 1.” Within the accessible data environment, the relevant dataset is the TabFact PostgreSQL database’s public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty table, which has a “2nd leg” column for each year.

Data source consulted: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4) → public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty

Evidence:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "2nd leg" FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty WHERE year = 2004;

- Result:
  2nd leg
  4 - 1

Conclusion: The table records the 2nd leg score for 2004 as “4 - 1,” matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the “2nd leg” value for the year 2004 in the available copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty table.
- Formatting differences like “4-1” vs “4 - 1” are considered equivalent.
