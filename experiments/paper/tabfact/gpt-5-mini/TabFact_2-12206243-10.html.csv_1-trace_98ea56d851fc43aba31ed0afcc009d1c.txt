Claim to verify: “on september 22 23 , 3380 crowd witness a win against the yankee of 8 - 1”

Summary conclusion:
- Date/opponent: A Blue Jays vs. Yankees game did occur on September 22 (1997 season data).
- Score: The score was “8 - 1” in that game, but this table formats scores as opponent-first. So Yankees 8, Blue Jays 1. It was not a Blue Jays win.
- Attendance: 23,380 (not 3,380).

Evidence from the data (with exact executed SQL):
1) How the Yankees are labeled in the data
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY opponent;
- Result includes: “yankees”

2) All Yankees games around that date (chronology and the Sept 22 line with attendance)
- SQL (chronological listing for Yankees games by parsing date text as 1997 dates):
  SELECT date, score, attendance, to_date(initcap(date) || ' 1997','FMMonth DD YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Yankees%'
  ORDER BY parsed_date;
- Relevant returned rows:
  • september 19 — score: 3 - 0 — attendance: 31,195
  • september 20 — score: 4 - 3 (11) — attendance: 38,332
  • september 21 — score: 5 - 4 (10) — attendance: 40,038
  • september 22 — score: 8 - 1 — attendance: 23,380

3) The specific September 22 game details (outcome, attendance, record after the game)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
  FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%september 22%'
    AND lower(opponent) LIKE '%yankee%';
- Result:
  • date: september 22
  • opponent: yankees
  • score: 8 - 1
  • loss: hentgen (15 - 10)
  • attendance: 23380
  • record: 72 - 84
- Interpretation: “loss: hentgen” indicates the losing pitcher was Blue Jays’ Pat Hentgen; the record became 72–84, meaning Toronto lost that game. Thus the 8–1 score is Yankees 8, Blue Jays 1.

4) How we know the score ordering is opponent-first (using prior games in the same series)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
  FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Yankee%'
    AND (date ILIKE '%September 19%' OR date ILIKE '%September 20%' OR date ILIKE '%September 21%')
  ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  • Sept 19: score 3 - 0, loss: gooden (8 - 5), record: 72 - 81 → Blue Jays loss (losses increased to 81) → score reads Yankees 3, Blue Jays 0.
  • Sept 20: score 4 - 3 (11), loss: janzen (1 - 1), record: 72 - 82 → Blue Jays loss → score reads Yankees 4, Blue Jays 3.
  • Sept 21: score 5 - 4 (10), loss: almanzar (0 - 1), record: 72 - 83 → Blue Jays loss → score reads Yankees 5, Blue Jays 4.
- Therefore the “score” field is opponent runs first, Blue Jays runs second. By the same convention, Sept 22’s “8 - 1” is Yankees 8, Blue Jays 1.

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- “on september 22” — Supported (the game occurred on Sept 22).
- “against the yankee” — Supported (opponent is “yankees”).
- “win … of 8 - 1” — Contradicted. The Blue Jays lost; the 8–1 line is Yankees 8, Blue Jays 1.
- “3380 crowd” — Contradicted. The recorded attendance is 23,380.

Final determination: The core outcome (win) and the attendance figure are incorrect according to the data. The date and opponent are correct.

Assumptions made:
- The available table (t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season) represents the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season and the date “september 22” is in 1997.
- The “record” column is the Blue Jays’ record after the game, allowing inference of win/loss.
- The “score” field is formatted as “opponent_runs - blue_jays_runs,” as evidenced by the series on Sept 19–21 combined with record changes.
