Claim interpreted: “There were 2 Zakspeed chassis made/used in 1987.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table found: public.zakspeed with columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint).

Evidence
1) Retrieve the 1987 Zakspeed entry
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1987;
Result:
- year: 1987
- chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871
- engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c
- tyres: g
- points: 2
Interpretation: The chassis field for 1987 lists two chassis models: “zakspeed 861” and “zakspeed 871”.

2) Count the number of chassis models listed for 1987
SQL:
SELECT year, chassis, (length(lower(coalesce(chassis,''))) - length(replace(lower(coalesce(chassis,'')),'zakspeed',''))) / length('zakspeed') AS zakspeed_count FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1987;
Result:
- year: 1987
- chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871
- zakspeed_count: 2
Interpretation: There are two occurrences of the substring “zakspeed” in the chassis field, confirming two chassis models noted for 1987.

Conclusion
- The database shows that Zakspeed used two chassis models in 1987: Zakspeed 861 and Zakspeed 871. This supports the claim that there were 2 Zakspeed chassis in 1987.

Assumptions
- “make” is interpreted as “chassis models used/made that season,” not the number of physical individual chassis constructed.
- The public.zakspeed table is treated as authoritative per the data-grounding instructions.
