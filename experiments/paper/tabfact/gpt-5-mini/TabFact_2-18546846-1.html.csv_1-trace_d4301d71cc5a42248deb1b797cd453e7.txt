Claim interpreted: “The 49ers’ first opponent of the season was the Brooklyn Dodgers.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, record)

Evidence from data:
- The 1947 San Francisco 49ers season table shows their Week 1 (first) opponent as the Brooklyn Dodgers, on August 31, 1947. The 49ers won 23–7, moving to a 1–0 record.

Executed SQL and results:
1) Check that a Week 1 row exists
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = 1;
Result:
cnt = 1

2) Retrieve Week 1 opponent and date
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = 1;
Result:
week = 1, date = "august 31 , 1947", opponent = "brooklyn dodgers"

3) Retrieve the full Week 1 row for context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = 1;
Result (week, date, opponent, result, score, record):
1 | august 31 , 1947 | brooklyn dodgers | w | 23 - 7 | 1 - 0

Conclusion: The data confirms that the San Francisco 49ers’ first opponent in the 1947 season was the Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC), and the 49ers won 23–7.

Assumptions:
- “49ers” refers to the San Francisco 49ers (AAFC/NFL).
- “First opponent of the season” refers to Week 1 of the 1947 season, as represented in the available table.
- “Brooklyn Dodger” is interpreted as the AAFC football team “Brooklyn Dodgers,” not the MLB baseball team.
