Claim to verify: “Jerry Mitchell [has] been nominated for a Drama Desk Award 3 times.”

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database ‘postgres_tabfact19’ (TabFact). Only one table detected: public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical with columns (year, award, category, nominee, result). This table records awards/nominations for the musical La Cage aux Folles.

Evidence gathered
1) Find all entries for nominee Jerry Mitchell in the available table.
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE nominee ILIKE 'Jerry Mitchell';
   - Result rows:
     • 2005 | tony award | best choreography | jerry mitchell | won
     • 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding choreography | jerry mitchell | won

2) Count Jerry Mitchell’s Drama Desk entries and list their result types.
   - Executed SQL (count):
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Jerry Mitchell%' AND award ILIKE '%Drama Desk%';
   - Returned: {count: 1}
   - Executed SQL (distinct results):
     SELECT DISTINCT result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Jerry Mitchell%' AND award ILIKE '%Drama Desk%';
   - Returned: [{result: "won"}]

Analysis
- Within the only accessible dataset (awards for La Cage aux Folles), Jerry Mitchell appears exactly once in connection with the Drama Desk Award, and that entry is a win. There is no evidence in this dataset of three Drama Desk nominations for Jerry Mitchell.
- While Jerry Mitchell may have other Drama Desk nominations across his career, those would fall outside the scope of the single available table. Based strictly on the available data, the specific claim of “3 times” is not supported.

Conclusion
- The data shows 1 Drama Desk record (a win) for Jerry Mitchell related to La Cage aux Folles, not 3 nominations.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Assumed the claim refers to Jerry Mitchell (choreographer/director). The available data only covers the La Cage aux Folles musical’s awards. If the intent was to count all-career Drama Desk nominations, the accessible data is insufficient; however, the claim of “3” is not supported by the evidence we do have. If the intent was limited to La Cage aux Folles, the claim is contradicted (only 1 record, and it is a win).
