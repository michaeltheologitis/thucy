Claim to verify: “multiple people be prison escapist and each leave the cube alive.”

Data source explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL TabFact database (public schema) with one relevant table: cube_film_series(name, occupation, gender, "prison connection", "played by", status).

Evidence from the data
1) Distinct values for prison connection and status
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "prison connection" FROM public.cube_film_series ORDER BY "prison connection";
  Results:
  - centre pãnitentiaire de rennes (france)
  - holloway women 's prison (uk)
  - kazan prison (russia)
  - leavenworth prison (usa)
  - san quentin state prison (usa)

- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT status FROM public.cube_film_series ORDER BY status;
  Results:
  - alive after exiting the cube
  - dead

2) Who “left the cube alive”
- SQL:
  SELECT name, occupation, gender, "prison connection", "played by" FROM cube_film_series WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
  Result:
  - name: kazan | occupation: autistic savant | gender: male | prison connection: kazan prison (russia) | played by: andrew miller

- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_alive_after_exiting_the_cube FROM cube_film_series WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
  Result: 1

3) How many characters have a prison connection, and what are their outcomes?
- SQL (list):
  SELECT name, "prison connection" FROM cube_film_series WHERE "prison connection" IS NOT NULL;
  Results:
  - kazan — kazan prison (russia)
  - david worth — leavenworth prison (usa)
  - quentin — san quentin state prison (usa)
  - joan leaven — leavenworth prison (usa)
  - dr helen holloway — holloway women's prison (uk)
  - rennes — centre pãnitentiaire de rennes (france)

- SQL (statuses):
  SELECT name, "prison connection", status FROM cube_film_series WHERE "prison connection" IS NOT NULL;
  Results:
  - kazan — kazan prison (russia) — alive after exiting the cube
  - david worth — leavenworth prison (usa) — dead
  - quentin — san quentin state prison (usa) — dead
  - joan leaven — leavenworth prison (usa) — dead
  - dr helen holloway — holloway women's prison (uk) — dead
  - rennes — centre pãnitentiaire de rennes (france) — dead

Assessment
- Multiple characters do have a prison connection (6 in total), satisfying the “multiple people be prison escapist” interpretation.
- However, only one character (Kazan) is “alive after exiting the cube.” The phrase “each leave the cube alive” is contradicted by the data, since 5 of the 6 prison-connected characters are listed as dead.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate overall because the requirement that each of the multiple prison-connected individuals leaves the cube alive is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “prison escapist” as characters with a listed “prison connection.”
- Interpreted “leave the cube alive” as status = “alive after exiting the cube.”
- Limited to the available cube_film_series table in the discovered TabFact database.
