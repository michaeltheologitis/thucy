Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact7 (TabFact), schema: public
- Table: t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
- Columns: date (text), score (text), set 1 (text), set 2 (text), set 3 (text), total (text)

Context and formatting check
1) Table size
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification;
Result: total_rows = 6

2) Distinct date strings
SQL:
SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
GROUP BY date
ORDER BY cnt DESC, date
LIMIT 200;
Results:
- 13 jul (2)
- 14 jul (2)
- 15 jul (2)

3) Distinct examples of the "set 2" values
SQL:
SELECT "set 2", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
GROUP BY "set 2"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "set 2";
Results include: '25 - 10' (2), '16 - 25' (1), '17 - 25' (1), '19 - 25' (1), '25 - 16' (1)

Direct verification of the claim
4) Check for a row on 15 jul with set 2 = '16 - 25'
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE "date" = '15 jul' AND "set 2" = '16 - 25';
Result: No rows returned.

5) Identify where set 2 = '16 - 25' actually occurs
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE "date" = '14 jul' AND "set 2" = '16 - 25';
Result: 1 row returned
- date: 14 jul
- score: 1 - 3
- set 1: 25 - 22
- set 2: 16 - 25
- set 3: 15 - 25
- total: 70 - 97

Additional context (full table view for clarity)
SQL:
SELECT date, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", score, total
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
ORDER BY date, "set 1";
Key rows for 15 jul:
- 15 jul: set 1 = '16 - 25', set 2 = '19 - 25', set 3 = '18 - 25', score = '0 - 3', total = '53 - 75'
- 15 jul: set 1 = '25 - 23', set 2 = '25 - 16', set 3 = '25 - 14', score = '3 - 0', total = '75 - 53'
