Summary of data sources and schema consulted:
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database postgres_tabfact7, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.tsuki_no_koibito with columns ["Unnamed: 0" text, "episode title" text, "romanized title" text, "translation of title" text, "broadcast date" text, "ratings" text].

Goal interpreted: Verify whether the row with romanized title "suki to ietara iinoni" has the 2nd most recent broadcast date among all rows in tsuki_no_koibito.

Executed SQL and results:
1) Query to inspect sample rows and date formats:
SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date" FROM tsuki_no_koibito LIMIT 50;
Returned sample rows:
- romanized title: omae ga hosii, broadcast date: may 10 , 2010
- romanized title: arienai kisu, broadcast date: may 17 , 2010
- romanized title: fukusyū no puropōzu, broadcast date: may 24 , 2010
- romanized title: konna ni suki dattanda…, broadcast date: may 31 , 2010
- romanized title: suki to ietara iinoni, broadcast date: june 7 , 2010
- romanized title: saishūshōjomakuwakare, broadcast date: june 14 , 2010

2) Main query to rank episodes by broadcast date (most recent first):
SQL:
SELECT row_number() OVER (ORDER BY to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\s+,', ',', 'g')), 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC) AS recency_rank, "romanized title", "broadcast date"
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\s+,', ',', 'g')), 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC;
Returned rows (ordered by broadcast date descending):
1. recency_rank: 1, romanized title: saishūshōjomakuwakare, broadcast date: june 14 , 2010
2. recency_rank: 2, romanized title: suki to ietara iinoni, broadcast date: june 7 , 2010
3. recency_rank: 3, romanized title: konna ni suki dattanda…, broadcast date: may 31 , 2010
4. recency_rank: 4, romanized title: fukusyū no puropōzu, broadcast date: may 24 , 2010
5. recency_rank: 5, romanized title: arienai kisu, broadcast date: may 17 , 2010
6. recency_rank: 6, romanized title: omae ga hosii, broadcast date: may 10 , 2010

Finding:
- The row with romanized title "suki to ietara iinoni" has recency_rank = 2, i.e., it has the 2nd most recent broadcast date in the table.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the tsuki_no_koibito table in the discovered data source and the romanized title column is the identifier for the episode. The text dates were normalized using initcap and a small cleanup of the comma spacing to parse as 'Month DD, YYYY'.
