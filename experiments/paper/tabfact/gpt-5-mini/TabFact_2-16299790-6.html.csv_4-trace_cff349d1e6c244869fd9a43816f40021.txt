Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the relevant schema to ground the verification.
- Queried the tournament table to retrieve Robert Allenby’s recorded result and placement.

Data sources explored
- postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
  - Table: t_2002_u_s_open_golf

Schema inspected
- Table columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)
- This table records players’ placement, name, nationality, aggregate score (as a string showing round-by-round and total), and score relative to par for the 2002 U.S. Open.

Evidence from data
- Retrieved row for player matching Robert Allenby:
  - place: t5
  - player: robert allenby
  - score: 74 + 70 + 67 = 211
  - to par: + 1

Executed SQL (evidence)
SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Robert Allenby%';

Assessment
- The data shows Robert Allenby with a total of 211 (as presented in the score field: 74 + 70 + 67 = 211) and a placement of T5 (tie for 5th), which directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2002 U.S. Open golf results represented in the available table (t_2002_u_s_open_golf).
- The “score” field’s aggregate (211) is the basis for the stated tie for 5th place in that dataset.
