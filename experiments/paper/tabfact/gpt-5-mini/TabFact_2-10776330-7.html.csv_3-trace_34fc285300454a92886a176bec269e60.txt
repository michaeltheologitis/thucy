Data source exploration
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database (public schema) with one relevant table: public.t_1961_vfl_season. Columns include: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), and "date" (text).

Goal
- Verify whether the Lake Oval venue recorded lower crowd participation than the Glenferrie Oval venue (within the available dataset).

Method
- Compute the number of matches and average crowd per venue across the table, and then compare Lake Oval vs Glenferrie Oval.

Evidence
1) Distinct venues with number of matches and average crowd
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches, ROUND(AVG(crowd),2) AS avg_crowd
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY matches DESC, venue;

Result (venue — matches — avg_crowd):
- arden street oval — 1 — 13000.00
- glenferrie oval — 1 — 15000.00
- kardinia park — 1 — 18683.00
- lake oval — 1 — 14500.00
- mcg — 1 — 49678.00
- victoria park — 1 — 28290.00

2) Focus on Lake Oval and Glenferrie Oval (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches, ROUND(AVG(crowd),2) AS avg_crowd
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) IN ('lake oval','glenferrie oval')
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY venue;

Result (venue — matches — avg_crowd):
- glenferrie oval — 1 — 15000.00
- lake oval — 1 — 14500.00

Findings
- Glenferrie Oval average crowd: 15,000 (from 1 recorded match in this dataset).
- Lake Oval average crowd: 14,500 (from 1 recorded match in this dataset).
- Therefore, Lake Oval recorded lower crowd participation than Glenferrie Oval in the available data.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the evidence in the dataset: Lake Oval has lower recorded crowd numbers than Glenferrie Oval.

Assumptions and scope
- Interpreted “crowd participation” as average match attendance per venue as recorded in this table.
- Results reflect only the matches contained in public.t_1961_vfl_season (1961 VFL season); no broader seasons or competitions are included here.
- Venue matching performed case-insensitively on the venue names provided.
