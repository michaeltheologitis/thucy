Claim to verify: "6 game have an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 new york jet season"

Summary conclusion: The data show that all 16 games in the 1993 New York Jets season had attendance greater than 7,000. Therefore, the claim is not supported.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) How many games had attendance > 7000?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS games_over_7000 FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE (regexp_replace(attendance::text, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int > 7000;
- Result: {"games_over_7000":16}

2) List the games with attendance > 7000 (week, date, opponent, game site, attendance)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE (regexp_replace(attendance::text, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int > 7000 ORDER BY week;

3) Total number of games in the season table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
- Result: {"total_games":16}

Additional context (in case the intended threshold was 70,000)
- Verified column types:
  SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='t_1993_new_york_jets_season' AND table_schema='public';
  Result:
  [{"column_name":"week","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"date","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"opponent","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"result","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"game site","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"attendance","data_type":"bigint"}]
- Count of games with attendance > 70000:
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000;
  Result: [{"count":7}]
- Weeks with attendance > 70000:
  SQL:
  SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000 ORDER BY week;
  Result: [{"attendance":70314,"week":2},{"attendance":72593,"week":5},{"attendance":71541,"week":8},{"attendance":71659,"week":9},{"attendance":71306,"week":10},{"attendance":73233,"week":16},{"attendance":70817,"week":17}]

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: there were 16 games with attendance over 7,000, not 6.

Assumptions
- The table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season fully enumerates the 1993 New York Jets regular-season schedule and recorded attendances. No additional postseason games are present in this table.
- The threshold stated in the claim is 7,000; the additional 70,000 analysis is provided only as context.
