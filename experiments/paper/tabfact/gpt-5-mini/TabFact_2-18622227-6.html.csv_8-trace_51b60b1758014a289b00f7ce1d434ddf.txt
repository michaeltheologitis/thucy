Claim interpreted: The US Open result in 1990 and 1999 are different (within the available dataset). I interpret this as referring to the Katrina Adams tournament results table discovered in the data source.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.katrina_adams (columns include: tournament, 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999)

Step 1 — Identify the exact tournament row name
- SQL executed:
  SELECT tournament FROM public.katrina_adams ORDER BY tournament;
- Result (excerpt):
  - australian open
  - french open
  - grand slam tournaments
  - us open
  - wimbledon
- Finding: The tournament is listed exactly as "us open".

Step 2 — Retrieve 1990 and 1999 results for "us open"
- SQL executed:
  SELECT tournament, "1990", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament ILIKE 'us open';
- Returned row:
  {"tournament":"us open", "1990":"3r", "1999":"1r"}
- Finding: 1990 = 3r; 1999 = 1r. These values are different.

Assessment:
- The data shows different results for the US Open between 1990 and 1999 in this table (3rd round vs 1st round). The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the "us open" row in the public.katrina_adams table (i.e., Katrina Adams' results by year).
