Summary of verification:
- Data source explored: postgres_tabfact32 (public schema). Available table: t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b with columns [goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team].
- The table contains goalkeeper statistics. I searched for a name matching “Zapata” and/or starting with “Mig…”. I found a row for “miguel zapata” (Atlético Ciudad) with 28 matches and 17 goals, average 0.61 (which equals 17/28).
- Interpretation: In this dataset, the subject is a goalkeeper; the “goals” column represents goals conceded. The numeric statement “28 matches” and “17 goals” is supported. The phrasing “he score only 17 goal” is misleading if interpreted as goals scored.

Conclusion:
- The numbers (28 matches and 17 goals) match the data for Miguel Zapata in this dataset. However, as a goalkeeper stat, those 17 are goals conceded, not goals scored. Therefore, the claim’s numbers are correct, but the wording about “scoring” is inaccurate.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) Count potential matches by name
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE lower(goalkeeper) LIKE '%zapata%'
   OR lower(goalkeeper) LIKE 'mig%';
Result:
- match_count = 1

2) Retrieve matching row(s)
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, team, matches, goals, average
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE lower(goalkeeper) LIKE '%zapata%'
   OR lower(goalkeeper) LIKE 'mig%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata
- team: atlético ciudad
- matches: 28
- goals: 17
- average: 0.61

Assumptions made:
- “migues zapata” refers to “Miguel Zapata” in the table t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b.
- The “goals” column for goalkeepers represents goals conceded (supported by average = 17/28 ≈ 0.61).
