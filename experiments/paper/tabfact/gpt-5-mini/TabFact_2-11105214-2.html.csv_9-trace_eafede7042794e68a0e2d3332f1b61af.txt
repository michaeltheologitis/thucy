Claim to verify: “0.17 be the highest swing to gain point in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007.”

Findings grounded in data:
- The maximum “swing to gain” recorded in the dataset is 4.91, not 0.17.
- The constituency associated with the maximum swing is “paisley south,” with “labour” as the 2003 winning party.
- A value of 0.17 does exist in the dataset (for “galloway & upper nithsdale,” 2003 winning party “conservative”), but it is far from the maximum and outside the top values.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) Maximum swing to gain
SQL:
SELECT MAX("swing to gain") AS max_swing FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
Result:
max_swing = 4.91

2) Row(s) at the maximum swing
SQL:
SELECT constituency, "winning party 2003", "swing to gain"
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE "swing to gain" = (SELECT MAX("swing to gain") FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007);
Result:
- constituency: paisley south, winning party 2003: labour, swing to gain: 4.91

3) Context: Top 10 highest swings
SQL:
SELECT constituency, "winning party 2003", "swing to gain"
FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
ORDER BY "swing to gain" DESC
LIMIT 10;
Result (descending):
1. paisley south — labour — 4.91
2. west renfrewshire — labour — 4.41
3. linlithgow — labour — 3.56
4. aberdeen central — labour — 2.96
5. glasgow govan — labour — 2.92
6. western isles — labour — 2.91
7. dundee west — labour — 2.13
8. kilmarnock & loudoun — labour — 1.92
9. cumbernauld & kilsyth — labour — 1.07
10. tweeddale , ettrick & lauderdale — liberal democrats — 1.01

4) Check for 0.17 specifically
SQL:
SELECT constituency, "winning party 2003", "swing to gain"
FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE "swing to gain" = 0.17;
Result:
- galloway & upper nithsdale — conservative — 0.17

Conclusion:
- The statement is contradicted by the data: the highest “swing to gain” is 4.91, not 0.17.

Assumptions made:
- “swing to gain point” refers to the “swing to gain” measure in the table scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 within the available TabFact database.
