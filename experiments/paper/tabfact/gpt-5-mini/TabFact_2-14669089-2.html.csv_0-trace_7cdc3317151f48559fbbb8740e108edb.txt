Data sources explored:
- postgres_tabfact17.public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa (columns: name, city, years as tallest, metres, feet, floors)

What I checked:
- Whether the record for “kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building” exists
- Its floor count
- Its years listed as tallest

Evidence found:
- Matching record shows:
  - name: kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building
  - city: johannesburg
  - floors: 31
  - years as tallest: 1970 - 1973

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT name, city, floors, "years as tallest" FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE name ILIKE '%Egoli%' OR name ILIKE '%Kwadukuza%' OR name ILIKE '%Trust%';

Assessment of the claim:
- “...have 31 floor”: Supported. The table lists floors = 31.
- “...be the tallest from year 1970 - 1973”: Supported. The table’s “years as tallest” field shows 1970 - 1973 for this entry, and this table specifically covers tallest buildings in Africa.

Conclusion: The claim matches the authoritative dataset.

Assumptions:
- The comma-separated name "kwadukuza egoli hotel tower 1 , trust bank building" represents the same building known by multiple names.
- “be the tallest” refers to tallest in Africa, consistent with the table’s domain.
