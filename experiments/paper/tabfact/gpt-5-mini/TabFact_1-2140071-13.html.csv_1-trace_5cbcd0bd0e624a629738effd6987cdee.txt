Interpretation of the claim: The statement appears to assert that 13 is the only season listed in the dataset we have access to (public.made_tv_series).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.made_tv_series

Schema overview (public.made_tv_series):
- season (bigint)
- episode (bigint)
- episode summary (text)
- premier date (text)
- external link (text)
- coach (text)

Evidence collected:
1) List distinct seasons present
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.made_tv_series ORDER BY season ASC;
Result:
- season = 13

2) Count unique seasons
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS unique_season_count FROM public.made_tv_series;
Result:
- unique_season_count = 1

3) Sanity check: counts of rows per condition
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE season IS NULL) AS season_null_count,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE season = 13) AS season_13_count
FROM public.made_tv_series;
Results:
- total_rows = 15
- season_null_count = 0
- season_13_count = 15

Conclusion:
- The only season present in the table is 13. There are no other season values and no NULL seasons. This fully supports the claim that 13 is the only season listed.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the seasons listed in the accessible dataset (public.made_tv_series). The phrasing “13 be the only season list” is interpreted as “13 is the only season listed.”
