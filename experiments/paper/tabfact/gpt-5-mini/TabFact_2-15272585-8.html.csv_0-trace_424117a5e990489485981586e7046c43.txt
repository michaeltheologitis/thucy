Summary
- Claim: “galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court.”
- Interpretation: Count of matches that Galina Voskoboeva played on hard surfaces (including indoor hard).
- Result: The data shows 3 matches on hard surfaces.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data environment: TabFact PostgreSQL database (accessed as postgres_tabfact10), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.galina_voskoboeva (columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct surfaces with counts
SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- surface = "hard (i)" → count = 2
- surface = "clay" → count = 2
- surface = "hard" → count = 1

2) Identify surface values considered “hard” (case-insensitive substring match)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT surface FROM galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface ILIKE '%hard%';
Result:
- hard
- hard (i)

3) Count matches on any hard surface (including indoor hard)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS hard_match_count FROM galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface ILIKE '%hard%';
Result:
- hard_match_count: 3

Conclusion
- The table lists 1 match on “hard” and 2 matches on “hard (i)” (indoor hard), totaling 3 matches on hard courts. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “game” is interpreted as “match.”
- “hard tennis court” includes both outdoor and indoor hard surfaces (e.g., “hard (i)”).
