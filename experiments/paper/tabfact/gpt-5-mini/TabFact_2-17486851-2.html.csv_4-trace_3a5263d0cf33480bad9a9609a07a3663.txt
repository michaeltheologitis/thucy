Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season transfer table, the player who moved to Trofense in the summer window is Zé Carlos, not Paulo Costa. Additionally, the only Paulo Costa entry shows a move to Anorthosis Famagusta in the winter window.

Data source explored: TabFact (public schema). Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) To find any summer moves to Trofense:
SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window", "transfer fee", type FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE "moving to" ILIKE '%Trofense%' AND "transfer window" ILIKE '%Summer%';
Result:
- name: zé carlos; moving to: trofense; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: free; type: contract termination.

2) To find any entries for a player named Paulo Costa:
SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window" FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE '%Paulo Costa%';
Result:
- name: paulo costa; moving to: anorthosis famagusta; transfer window: winter.

Assessment:
- The data shows that the summer move to Trofense was by Zé Carlos, not Paulo Costa.
- The only Paulo Costa record indicates a winter move to Anorthosis Famagusta, not to Trofense.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the transfer records available in the TabFact database (APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season table).
- Matching for names and clubs was done case-insensitively using substring matching (ILIKE with wildcards).
