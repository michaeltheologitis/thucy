Data sources discovered:
- postgres_tabfact19 (TabFact). Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (columns: game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance).

Evidence 1: Distinct scorelines and their frequencies
SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
GROUP BY result
ORDER BY count DESC, result;
Key returned rows:
- 0 - 0 — 5
- 5 - 0 — 1

Evidence 2: Exact count of 0 - 0 results
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_0_0 FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '0 - 0';
Result: count_0_0 = 5

Evidence 3: Exact count (and details) of 5 - 0 results
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_5_0 FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '5 - 0';
Result: count_5_0 = 1

SQL (details):
SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '5 - 0';
Returned row: {game: 35, date: '7 march 2009', opponent: 'aldershot town', venue: 'home', result: '5 - 0', attendance: 12465}

Conclusion:
- The claim that 5 games ended 0 - 0 is supported by the data.
- The claim that 3 games ended 5 - 0 is contradicted by the data; only 1 such game is present.

Assumptions:
- “game list” refers to all fixtures in public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season.
- Results were matched exactly as stored (e.g., '0 - 0', '5 - 0').
