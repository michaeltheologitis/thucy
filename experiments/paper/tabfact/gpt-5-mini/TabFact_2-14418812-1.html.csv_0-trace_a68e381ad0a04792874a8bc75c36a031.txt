Interpretation
- Within the available data, there is a confirmed instance where the New York Jets played at 1:00 pm on a Sunday, November 27 (context: the 1977 Pittsburgh Steelers season table, which implies the year is 1977).

Assumptions
- Because the user did not specify a year and the only accessible data is a historical table for the 1977 Steelers season, I interpret the claim as asking whether such a scheduling statement is true in the available data. If the user intended a different year (e.g., a recent or upcoming season), that cannot be verified from the provided data source.
