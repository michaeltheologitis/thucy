Claim interpreted: “The average win percentage of a season with a GB of 5 is 535.”

What I checked
- Identify a dataset containing seasons with a GB (games behind) field and win percentage.
- Find all seasons where gb = 5 and compute the average of the win percentage field.
- Verify how the win percentage is stored (e.g., 535 meaning 0.535/53.5%).

Data sources discovered
- Database: postgres_tabfact33 (TabFact)
- Table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
  Columns: year, record, win %, league, division, gb, post - season record, post - season win %, mlb affiliate

Evidence
1) Distinct GB values and their counts (to confirm presence and frequency of gb = '5')
SQL used:
SELECT gb, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
GROUP BY gb
ORDER BY cnt DESC, gb;
Result (excerpt): includes "5", cnt = 1 (there is exactly one season with gb = '5').

2) Retrieve the season(s) with gb = '5' and the stored win % value
SQL used:
SELECT year, "win %" FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';
Result: year = 2010, win % = 535

3) Compute the average win % (as stored and with common conversions)
SQL used:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, AVG("win %") AS avg_stored, AVG("win %")/1000.0 AS avg_decimal, AVG("win %")/10.0 AS avg_percentage FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';
Result: row_count = 1, avg_stored = 535.0, avg_decimal = 0.535, avg_percentage = 53.5

4) How the win % column is encoded (validation)
SQL used:
SELECT year, gb, "win %", ("win %"::numeric)/1000 AS win_decimal, ROUND(("win %"::numeric)/1000*100,1) AS win_percent FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons ORDER BY year LIMIT 10;
Observation: Values like 535 correspond to 0.535 (53.5%), confirming the encoding.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one season with gb = '5' (year 2010), with a stored “win %” of 535. Therefore, the average win percentage among seasons with GB = 5 equals 535 (which corresponds to 0.535 or 53.5%). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (Nashville Sounds seasons) as the scope for “season.”
- “535” denotes the stored representation of win percentage in thousandths (0.535 = 53.5%).
