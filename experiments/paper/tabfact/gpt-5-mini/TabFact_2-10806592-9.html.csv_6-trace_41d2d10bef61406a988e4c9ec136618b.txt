Claim interpreted: In the available dataset (1938 VFL season table), the statement “there be no home team that score more than 11” is taken to mean “no home team scored more than 11 goals.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5) with table public.t_1938_vfl_season containing match results with Australian rules football scoring.

Schema summary (from schema tool)
- Table public.t_1938_vfl_season columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
- Score format: goals.behinds (total points) e.g., 11.23 (89)

Evidence: score format check
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season LIMIT 5;
- Returned examples:
  - geelong — 11.23 (89) vs hawthorn — 6.13 (49)
  - fitzroy — 16.12 (108) vs south melbourne — 8.8 (56)
  - st kilda — 14.12 (96) vs melbourne — 16.16 (112)
  - richmond — 15.14 (104) vs essendon — 15.9 (99)
  - footscray — 13.9 (87) vs collingwood — 10.5 (65)
- Parsing confirmation (goals/behinds/points):
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "home team","home team score",
         split_part("home team score",'.',1)::int AS home_goals,
         split_part(split_part("home team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int AS home_behinds,
         split_part(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',1)::int AS home_total_points,
         (split_part("home team score",'.',1)::int*6 + split_part(split_part("home team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) AS home_computed_total,
         "away team","away team score",
         split_part("away team score",'.',1)::int AS away_goals,
         split_part(split_part("away team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int AS away_behinds,
         split_part(split_part("away team score",'(',2),')',1)::int AS away_total_points,
         (split_part("away team score",'.',1)::int*6 + split_part(split_part("away team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) AS away_computed_total
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  LIMIT 5;
  Result: Computed totals match stored totals, confirming goals.behinds (points) format.

Context size
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
- Result: total_rows = 6

Core verification: any home team scoring more than 11 goals?
- SQL executed (count > 11 goals):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_with_home_goals_gt_11
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team score" IS NOT NULL
    AND (split_part(trim("home team score"), '.', 1))::int > 11;
  Result: matches_with_home_goals_gt_11 = 4

- SQL executed (maximum home goals):
  SELECT MAX((split_part(trim("home team score"), '.', 1))::int) AS max_home_goals
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team score" IS NOT NULL;
  Result: max_home_goals = 16

- SQL executed (list home teams with > 11 goals):
  SELECT "home team", "home team score",
         split_part(split_part("home team score",' ',1),'.',1) AS home_goals_text,
         CAST(split_part(split_part("home team score",' ',1),'.',1) AS integer) AS home_goals
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE CAST(split_part(split_part("home team score",' ',1),'.',1) AS integer) > 11
  ORDER BY home_goals DESC, "date";
  Results:
  - fitzroy — 16.12 (108) — home_goals = 16
  - richmond — 15.14 (104) — home_goals = 15
  - st kilda — 14.12 (96) — home_goals = 14
  - footscray — 13.9 (87) — home_goals = 13

Conclusion
- The data show four matches where the home team scored more than 11 goals (max 16). Therefore, the claim “there be no home team that score more than 11” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “score more than 11” as “scored more than 11 goals,” based on the goals.behinds (total) formatting of the score fields in this dataset. If interpreted as total points, the claim would also be false, since all totals exceed 11 points in this table.
- Verification is scoped to the available table public.t_1938_vfl_season in the connected TabFact database.
