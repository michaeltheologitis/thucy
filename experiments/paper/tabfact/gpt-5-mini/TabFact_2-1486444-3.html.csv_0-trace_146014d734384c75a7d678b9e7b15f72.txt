What I checked
- The claim: “At the Shooto 2003 event on March 18th in Tokyo, Japan, he battled fighter Rumina Sato.” I interpreted “he” as Joachim Hansen, since the only available dataset is a table of Joachim Hansen’s fights.

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL source (public schema) with a single relevant table: joachim_hansen_fighter, containing columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.

Evidence from the data
1) Search by opponent name (Rumina Sato)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Rumina Sato%';
- Result (1 row):
  res: win
  record: 5 - 1 - 1
  opponent: rumina sato
  method: tko (punches)
  event: shooto 2003: 3 / 18
  round: 1
  time: 2:09
  location: tokyo , japan

2) Search by event string (Shooto 2003: 3/18)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT event, location, opponent, res, method, round, time
  FROM joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE event ILIKE '%shooto 2003: 3 / 18%';
- Result (1 row):
  event: shooto 2003: 3 / 18
  location: tokyo , japan
  opponent: rumina sato
  res: win
  method: tko (punches)
  round: 1
  time: 2:09

Assessment
- The table shows Joachim Hansen fought Rumina Sato at an event labeled “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” with location “tokyo , japan.” This matches the claim’s event (Shooto 2003), date (March 18), location (Tokyo, Japan), and opponent (Rumina Sato). The data supports that the bout occurred and provides additional details (result and method).

Assumptions
- “He” refers to Joachim Hansen, inferred from the dataset being a table of Joachim Hansen’s fights.
- The event label “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” corresponds to March 18, 2003, consistent with the claim’s wording.
- Only the provided authoritative data source was used for verification.
