Claim: "episode 11 have 2.77 million US viewer"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact" with table public.list_of_white_collar_episodes (episodes of the TV show White Collar). This table includes a column "no in season" (episode number within season) and "us viewers (million)" (U.S. viewership in millions).

Schema inspection (summary):
- Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text). No separate season-number column is present.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check the episode with episode-in-season number 11
SQL:
SELECT "no in season", title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in season" = 11;
Result:
- no in season: 11 | title: family business | us viewers (million): 2.77

2) Independently find any episode(s) with ~2.77M U.S. viewers
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE ABS("us viewers (million)" - 2.77) <= 0.01;
Result:
- no in series: 57 | no in season: 11 | title: family business | us viewers (million): 2.77

3) Interpretation check (if "episode 11" were meant as overall series episode #11)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 11;
Result: 0

Conclusion:
- In the authoritative White Collar episodes table, the episode with "no in season" = 11 (title "Family Business") has U.S. viewership of 2.77 million. Thus, the claim is supported when "episode 11" refers to the 11th episode within its season.

Assumptions:
- "Episode 11" is interpreted as the 11th episode within a season ("no in season" = 11) of White Collar, since this is the only available dataset. There is no separate season-number column in the dataset to provide additional season context.
