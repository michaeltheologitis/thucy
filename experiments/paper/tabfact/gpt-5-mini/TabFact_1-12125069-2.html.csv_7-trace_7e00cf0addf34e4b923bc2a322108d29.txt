Claim being checked: "kenny rogers be the losing pitcher when attendance be 38109"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season with columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)

Step 1: Find the game(s) with attendance = 38109 and check the listed losing pitcher.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", attendance, location
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE attendance = 38109;

Result:
- Date: may 20
  Winning team: texas
  Score: 7 - 3
  Winning pitcher: kenny rogers
  Losing pitcher: brandon backe
  Attendance: 38109
  Location: arlington

Interpretation: In the only game with attendance 38109, Kenny Rogers was the winning pitcher, not the losing pitcher. The losing pitcher was Brandon Backe.

Step 2 (corroboration): Check if any game in this table lists Kenny Rogers as the losing pitcher.
Executed SQL (returned 0 rows):
1) SELECT "date", attendance, "losing pitcher", "winning pitcher", "winning team", score, location
   FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
   WHERE "losing pitcher" ILIKE '%Kenny Rogers%'
   ORDER BY "date";
2) SELECT "date", attendance, "losing pitcher", "winning pitcher", "winning team", score, location
   FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
   WHERE "losing pitcher" ILIKE '%Rogers%'
   ORDER BY "date";

Conclusion: The data directly contradicts the claim. For the game with attendance 38109, Kenny Rogers was the winning pitcher; the losing pitcher was Brandon Backe. No entries in this table list Kenny Rogers as a losing pitcher.

Assumptions:
- The table public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season accurately reflects the 2005 Texas Rangers season game log and includes the relevant attendance, pitcher decisions, and game details.
- Name matching used case-insensitive search; pitcher names appear in the designated columns as plain text.
