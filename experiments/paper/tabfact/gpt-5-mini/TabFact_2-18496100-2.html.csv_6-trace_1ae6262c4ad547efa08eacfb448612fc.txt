Claim interpreted: The statement says that “Mehgaon tie with Datia to have the highest number of electorate in 2009.” I verify this against the available electoral dataset.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  - Key columns: name, district, number of electorates (2009), etc.

Evidence collected:
1) Full constituency list with 2009 electorate counts (excluding the aggregate total row), sorted high→low
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "constituency number", "name", "number of electorates (2009)" FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "constituency number" != 'total :' AND "name" != 'total :' ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC;
- Returned (top to bottom):
  - mehgaon — 210649
  - lahar — 205839
  - bhind — 197183
  - ater — 177334
  - gohad — 166893
  - datia — 143593
  - bhander — 139600
  - sewda — 130161

2) Maximum electorate count and which constituency(ies) have it
- SQL executed to get max (excluding aggregate/total rows):
  SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") AS max_electorates
  FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  WHERE "constituency number" ~ '^[0-9]+' AND "number of electorates (2009)" IS NOT NULL;
- Result: 210649
- SQL executed to list constituency(ies) at that maximum:
  SELECT "constituency number", "name", "reserved for ( sc / st / none)", "district", "number of electorates (2009)"
  FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  WHERE "constituency number" ~ '^[0-9]+'
    AND "number of electorates (2009)" = 210649;
- Result: constituency number 12; name: mehgaon; district: bhind; reserved: none; electorate (2009): 210649.

3) Direct comparison of Mehgaon and Datia electorate counts (2009)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "name", "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower("name") IN ('mehgaon','datia');
- Results:
  - mehgaon: 210649
  - datia: 143593

Conclusion:
- Mehgaon has the highest electorate count in 2009 with 210,649.
- Datia has 143,593, which is significantly lower and not tied with Mehgaon. There is no tie for the highest; Mehgaon stands alone at the top.

Answer: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Highest number of electorate in 2009” refers to the column “number of electorates (2009)” in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table.
- Aggregate/total rows (where fields equal 'total :') are excluded from constituency comparisons.
- Name matching is case-insensitive (e.g., 'mehgaon' vs 'Mehgaon').
