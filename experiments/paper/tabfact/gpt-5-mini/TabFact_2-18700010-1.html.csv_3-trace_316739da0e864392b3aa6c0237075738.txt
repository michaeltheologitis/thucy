Claim to verify: “the player with the highest number of total goal be ian robin.”

Data source discovery:
- Accessible data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23), public schema.
- Available table: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season.

Relevant schema (public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season):
- Columns: name (text), position (text), league apps (text), league goals (bigint), fa cup apps (bigint), fa cup goals (bigint), league cup apps (text), league cup goals (bigint), total apps (text), total goals (bigint).

Evidence 1 — Identify the top scorer by total goals:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY "total goals" DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1;
- Result:
  [{"name":"ian robins","total goals":27}]
- Interpretation: The player with the highest total goals is “Ian Robins” with 27.

Evidence 2 — Alternate confirmation by max filter (returns all ties, if any):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, position, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "total goals" = (SELECT MAX("total goals") FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season);
- Result:
  - name: "ian robins"; position: "fw"; total goals: 27
- Interpretation: Confirms the top scorer is Ian Robins.

Evidence 3 — Search for the claimed name variant:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
  WHERE name ~* 'ian.*robins?' OR name ~* 'robins?.*ian';
- Result:
  - name: "ian robins"; total goals: 27
- Interpretation: The dataset contains “Ian Robins.” The pattern also matches the misspelled/shortened “Ian Robin.”

Evidence 4 — Verify the total goals breakdown for the top scorer:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "league goals", "fa cup goals", "league cup goals", "total goals",
         ("league goals" + "fa cup goals" + "league cup goals") AS sum_parts,
         (("league goals" + "fa cup goals" + "league cup goals") - "total goals") AS diff,
         (("league goals" + "fa cup goals" + "league cup goals") = "total goals") AS matches_total
  FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
  WHERE name = 'ian robins';
- Result:
  [{"name":"ian robins","league goals":25,"fa cup goals":0,"league cup goals":2,"total goals":27,"sum_parts":27,"diff":0,"matches_total":true}]
- Interpretation: The total goals value (27) is internally consistent with component goals.

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows the top scorer (highest “total goals”) is Ian Robins with 27 total goals. The claim’s name “ian robin” appears to be a minor misspelling/variant of “Ian Robins.” Substantively, the claim is correct that the top scorer is Ian Robins.

Assumptions made:
- “Total goal” was interpreted as the “total goals” column in the available table.
- The claim refers to the only accessible dataset (1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season), since no other data sources are available via tools.
- Name matching was treated case-insensitively, and “ian robin” was interpreted as a misspelling of “Ian Robins.”
