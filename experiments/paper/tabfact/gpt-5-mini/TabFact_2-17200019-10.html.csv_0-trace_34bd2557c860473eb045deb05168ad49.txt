Claim interpreted: “There are 4 players who scored 3 goals in total, and all 4 are in league 4.” Using the only available dataset (public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season), where columns represent per-competition goal counts (league, title playoff, super cup) and total.

Data context (schema)
- Table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
- Columns: player (text), league (bigint), "title playoff" (bigint), "super cup" (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence
1) Count players with total = 3
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_players_with_total_3
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE total = 3;
Result: 5 players

List and breakdown:
SQL:
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE total = 3
ORDER BY player;
Results:
- dmitri bulykin: league=3, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=3
- jan polák: league=2, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=3
- jelle van damme: league=3, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=3
- lucas biglia: league=2, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=3
- matías suárez: league=1, title playoff=0, super cup=1, total=3

2) Check if any player has total = 3 and league = 4
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE total = 3 AND league = 4;
Result: 0 players

3) For reference, who has league = 4?
SQL (rows):
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE league = 4
ORDER BY player;
Results:
- roland juhász: league=4, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=4
- stanislav vlček: league=4, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=4
- thomas chatelle: league=4, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=4

SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE league = 4;
Result: 3 players

4) Alternate reading (if “all 3 goals were league goals”): total = 3 AND league = 3
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_players
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE total = 3 AND league = 3;
Result: 2 players

SQL (names):
SELECT player
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE total = 3 AND league = 3
ORDER BY player;
Results: dmitri bulykin; jelle van damme

Conclusion
- The data shows 5 players with total = 3 (not 4).
- None of those players have league = 4.
- Players with league = 4 all have total = 4, and there are only 3 of them.
- Even under an alternate interpretation (“all 3 goals were in the league”), only 2 players match.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “score 3 goal total” was interpreted as each player’s total column equals 3.
- “be in league 4” was interpreted as the league goals column equaling 4 (since this table’s “league” is a goal count by competition, not a league identifier).
