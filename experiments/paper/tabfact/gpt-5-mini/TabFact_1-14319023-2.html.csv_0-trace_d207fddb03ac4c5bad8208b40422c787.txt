Interpretation of the request
- I interpret your question as: In which year of the Indonesian National Badminton Championships did the girls singles champion be Lindaweni Fanetri and the mixed doubles champions be Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto?

Findings
- The data shows this occurred in 2007.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify rows where the girls singles champion’s name contains “Fanetri” to see the corresponding mixed doubles entry.
SQL executed:
SELECT year, "girls singles", "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls singles" ILIKE '%Fanetri%';
Result:
- year = 2007, girls singles = 'lindaweni fanetri', mixed doubles = 'wifqi windarto debby susanto'

2) Verify specifically that the girls singles is Lindaweni Fanetri and the mixed doubles contains both Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto (case-insensitive).
SQL executed:
SELECT year FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls singles" ILIKE 'lindaweni fanetri' AND "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%wifqi windarto%' AND "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%debby susanto%';
Result:
- year = 2007

Conclusion
- Year: 2007.

Assumptions
- “girl single” refers to the “girls singles” category in the Indonesian National Badminton Championships table found in the available data.
- Name matching is done case-insensitively because names in the table are stored in lowercase.
