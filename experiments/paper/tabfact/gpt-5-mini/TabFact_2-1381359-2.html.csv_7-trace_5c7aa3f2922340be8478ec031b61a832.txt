Claim to verify: “meiji be the looser in the game that have a title of 32nd with hosei as the runner - up.”

Data sources discovered
- Accessible relational database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19)
- Relevant table: public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship (columns: title, season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue, attendance)

Evidence 1: What happened in the edition titled “32nd”?
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, season, winner, "runner - up", score
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE title ILIKE '%32nd%';

Result:
- title: 32nd; season: 1995 - 6 details; winner: meiji; runner - up: waseda; score: 43 - 9

Finding: For the 32nd edition, Meiji is recorded as the winner and Waseda as the runner-up. This contradicts both parts of the claim (Meiji being the loser and Hosei being the runner-up).

Evidence 2: When is Hosei a runner-up (or winner)?
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, season, winner, "runner - up", score
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE winner ILIKE '%hosei%'
   OR "runner - up" ILIKE '%hosei%';

Results:
1) title: 30th; season: 1993 - 4 details; winner: meiji; runner - up: hosei; score: 41 - 12
2) title: 37th; season: 2000 - 1 details; winner: kanto gakuin university; runner - up: hosei; score: 42 - 15

Finding: Hosei appears as runner-up in the 30th and 37th editions, not the 32nd.

Evidence 3: Meiji’s wins (sanity check)
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, season, winner, "runner - up", score FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE winner ILIKE '%Meiji%';

Results:
- 30th: winner meiji; runner - up hosei; score 41 - 12
- 32nd: winner meiji; runner - up waseda; score 43 - 9
- 33rd: winner meiji; runner - up waseda; score 32 - 22

Finding: Confirms Meiji won the 32nd edition (runner-up Waseda), not a loser.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. In the edition titled “32nd,” Meiji is the winner and Waseda is the runner-up. Hosei is runner-up in other editions (30th, 37th), not the 32nd.

Assumptions
- “the game that have a title of 32nd” refers to the record with title = “32nd” in the public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship table.
- “runner - up” corresponds to the table’s "runner - up" column and “looser” means the losing team of the final (runner-up).
