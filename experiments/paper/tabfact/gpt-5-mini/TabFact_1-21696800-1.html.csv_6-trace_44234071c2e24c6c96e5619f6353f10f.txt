Claim to verify: "there be 6 episode number for episode direct by wayne rose"

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Finding: One accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact28). Only one relevant table was discovered: public.smallville_season_9 with columns: "no", "title", "directed by", "written by", "us air date", "production code", "us viewers (million)".

Step 2: Check for episodes directed by Wayne Rose in the available dataset
Approach: Query the smallville_season_9 table for rows where the "directed by" column matches Wayne Rose. Because director fields can include multiple names or formatting, I attempted both exact and case-insensitive substring matches.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Exact-match count
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" = 'Wayne Rose';
Result: cnt = 0

2) Case-insensitive substring match (to capture entries where the field contains the name among others)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%wayne rose%';
Result: count = 1

3) List matching episode numbers and titles
SQL executed:
SELECT "no", title FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%wayne rose%' ORDER BY "no";
Result: one row — no = 178, title = echo

Interpretation of evidence
- Within the only available dataset (Smallville Season 9), Wayne Rose is credited as director on exactly 1 episode, not 6. The episode identified is overall series episode number 178, titled "echo".

Conclusion
- The numeric claim that there are 6 episodes directed by Wayne Rose is not supported by the data available here. The data shows 1 such episode in this dataset.
- Part that is true: There is at least one episode directed by Wayne Rose in Smallville Season 9.
- Part that is false: The count is not 6; it is 1 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available data source (Smallville Season 9) since no other TV-episode tables are accessible.
- The column "no" is the overall series episode number, not the season-specific episode index.
- Director names may be stored with multiple names in one field; therefore, a case-insensitive substring match (ILIKE '%wayne rose%') was used to capture such cases.
