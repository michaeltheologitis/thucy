Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources to locate authoritative records about any “Hurricanes” team with season-by-season results.
- Identified a table named dundee_hurricanes that stores seasonal performance, including division, wins/losses/ties, final position, and promotion notes.
- Queried the 2007 season to calculate win percentage and check promotion status.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table dundee_hurricanes.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Table dundee_hurricanes(season bigint, division text, wins bigint, losses bigint, ties bigint, final position text, notes text).

Executed SQL and results
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT season, division, wins, losses, ties, "final position", notes,
         (wins + losses + ties) AS total_games,
         (wins::numeric / NULLIF((wins + losses + ties),0)) AS win_pct1,
         ((wins + 0.5 * ties)::numeric / NULLIF((wins + losses + ties),0)) AS win_pct2
  FROM dundee_hurricanes
  WHERE season = 2007;
- Returned row (season 2007):
  - season: 2007
  - division: bafl division 2 north
  - wins: 9
  - losses: 1
  - ties: 0
  - final position: 1 / 6
  - notes: promoted to division 1 north
  - total_games: 10
  - win_pct1 (wins / total games): 0.9
  - win_pct2 ((wins + 0.5*ties) / total games): 0.9

Assessment of the claim
- Claim part 1: “the hurricane only win 50% of their game in 2007”
  - Evidence shows 9 wins, 1 loss, 0 ties over 10 games. Win rate is 90% by both standard measures. This contradicts the 50% assertion.
- Claim part 2: “and do not get promote to a higher division”
  - Evidence notes: “promoted to division 1 north.” This directly contradicts the claim—they were promoted.

Conclusion
- Both core elements of the claim are contradicted by the data in the dundee_hurricanes table for 2007.

Assumptions
- “the hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes recorded in the dundee_hurricanes table.
- “win 50% of their game” is interpreted as wins divided by total games (and also checked using the common alternative that counts ties as half-wins), both yielding 90% for 2007.
- “promote to a higher division” corresponds to promotion status indicated in the notes field and the move from “bafl division 2 north” to “division 1 north.”
