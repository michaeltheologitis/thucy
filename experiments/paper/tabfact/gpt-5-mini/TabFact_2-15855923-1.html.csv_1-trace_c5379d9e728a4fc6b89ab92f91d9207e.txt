What I checked
- I first explored the available data sources and found a single PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact18 with one table in the public schema: public.kwak_tae_hwi (columns: date TEXT, venue TEXT, score TEXT, result TEXT, competition TEXT).

Evidence from the data
- I queried the table for any row where the competition mentions “2014 World Cup qualification”.

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi
WHERE competition ILIKE '%2014 World Cup qualification%';

Result:
- date: june 8 , 2012; venue: doha , qatar; score: 2 - 1; result: 4 - 1; competition: 2014 world cup qualification

Assessment
- The row matching “2014 world cup qualification” shows score = 2 - 1. Therefore, the claim that “the score of the 2014 world cup qualification be 2 - 1” is supported by the table’s “score” field.
- Note: The same row lists result = 4 - 1, which appears to be the final match score. The claim uses the term “score” (not “result”), and in this dataset the “score” column value is 2 - 1, so the claim aligns with the data as structured here.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the instance of “2014 world cup qualification” present in this table.
- “Score” is interpreted as the value from the table’s “score” column, not the “result” (final score) column.
