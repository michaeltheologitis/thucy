Summary conclusion
- The claim is incorrect for the available dataset: the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team lost 2 games in November and 1 game in September (not 1 in November and 2 in September).

Evidence from data
Data source: TabFact database, public schema, table t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

1) Full table excerpt to inspect dates and results
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, record FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team ORDER BY game;
Result:
[ {"date":"sept 20","game":1,"opponent":"ole miss","record":"0 - 1","result":"loss"},
  {"date":"sept 27","game":2,"opponent":"cincinnati","record":"1 - 1","result":"win"},
  {"date":"oct 4","game":3,"opponent":"xavier","record":"2 - 1","result":"win"},
  {"date":"oct 11","game":4,"opponent":"9 georgia","record":"3 - 1 , 20","result":"win"},
  {"date":"oct 18","game":5,"opponent":"10 vanderbilt","record":"4 - 1 , 14","result":"win"},
  {"date":"oct 25","game":6,"opponent":"michigan state","record":"5 - 1 , 13","result":"win"},
  {"date":"nov 1","game":7,"opponent":"18 alabama","record":"5 - 2","result":"loss"},
  {"date":"nov 8","game":8,"opponent":"west virginia","record":"6 - 2","result":"win"},
  {"date":"nov 15","game":9,"opponent":"evansville","record":"7 - 2","result":"win"},
  {"date":"nov 22","game":10,"opponent":"tennessee","record":"7 - 3","result":"loss"} ]

2) Count of losses in September
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sept_losses FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'sept%' AND lower(result) = 'loss';
Result:
[{"sept_losses":1}]

3) Count of losses in November
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nov_losses FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'nov%' AND lower(result) = 'loss';
Result:
[{"nov_losses":2}]

Assessment
- September losses = 1
- November losses = 2
- The claim states the reverse, so it is contradicted by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions
- "Wildcat(s)" was interpreted as the Kentucky Wildcats football team for the 1947 season because that is the only relevant dataset available in the connected data source.
- Month filtering used the month abbreviations present in the data (e.g., "sept", "nov").
