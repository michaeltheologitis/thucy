Claim to verify: “wrestling be the sport with the latest date in 2008.”

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Public schema tables: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date text, site text, sport text, "winning team" text, series text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify whether wrestling appears in the table and its date(s)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT sport FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series ORDER BY sport;
Result (distinct sports): football; m basketball; m cross country; m golf; softball; volleyball; w basketball; w cross country; w gymnastics; w soccer; w swimming; wrestling

SQL:
SELECT date, sport, site, "winning team", series
FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE sport ILIKE '%wrestling%';
Result:
- date: december 9 , 2007; sport: wrestling; site: ames; winning team: iowa; series: iowa state 16 - 5
Interpretation: The only wrestling row is dated in 2007, not 2008.

2) List all rows in 2008 and inspect their dates and sports
SQL:
SELECT * FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE date LIKE '%2008%';
Results:
- {date: "february 22 , 2008", site: "ames", sport: "w gymnastics", winning team: "iowa state", series: "iowa state 18 - 5"}
- {date: "march 7 , 2008", site: "iowa city", sport: "w gymnastics", winning team: "iowa", series: "iowa state 18 - 7"}
- {date: "april 1 , 2008", site: "ames", sport: "softball", winning team: "iowa", series: "iowa state 18 - 9"}

3) Parse 2008 dates to determine the latest date and which sport it corresponds to
SQL:
SELECT date, sport, to_date(initcap(date), 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE date LIKE '%2008%'
ORDER BY parsed_date;
Results:
- date: "february 22 , 2008"; sport: "w gymnastics"; parsed_date: 2008-02-22
- date: "march 7 , 2008"; sport: "w gymnastics"; parsed_date: 2008-03-07
- date: "april 1 , 2008"; sport: "softball"; parsed_date: 2008-04-01

SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT sport, to_date(initcap(date), 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  WHERE date LIKE '%2008%'
)
SELECT max(parsed_date) AS max_date FROM parsed;
Result:
- max_date: 2008-04-01

SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT sport, to_date(initcap(date), 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  WHERE date LIKE '%2008%'
)
SELECT sport FROM parsed WHERE parsed_date = (SELECT max(parsed_date) FROM parsed);
Result:
- sport: softball

Conclusion based on data
- Wrestling does not have any entries in 2008 in this table (only an entry on December 9, 2007).
- The latest date in 2008 is 2008-04-01, and the sport on that date is softball.
- Therefore, the claim that wrestling is the sport with the latest date in 2008 is not supported by the data and is contradicted by it.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series).
- Assumed the date text uses a "Month Day , Year" format; used initcap(...) with to_date('FMMonth DD , YYYY') for parsing.
