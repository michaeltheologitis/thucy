Summary
Claim: "there be no director that direct more than one episode."
Interpretation: In the available TV-episode dataset, no director appears as directing more than one episode.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL instance via postgres_tabfact28 (TabFact).
- Relevant table identified: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (episode-level data for the TV series "Republic of Doyle"). Key columns: title (text), "directed by" (text), and others.

Evidence
1) Distinct director values and their episode counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
GROUP BY "directed by"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "directed by";

Result (excerpt):
- mike clattenburg: 2
- robert lieberman: 2
- steve dimarco: 2
- jerry ciccoritti: 1
- larry mclean: 1
- phil earnshaw: 1
- steve scaini: 1

2) Directors with more than one episode
Executed SQL:
SELECT "directed by" AS director, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
WHERE "directed by" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("directed by") <> ''
GROUP BY "directed by"
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY cnt DESC, director;

Results:
- mike clattenburg — 2
- robert lieberman — 2
- steve dimarco — 2

Conclusion
The data shows multiple directors who directed two episodes each. Therefore, the claim that no director directed more than one episode is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Scope: Verified against the available dataset public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (Republic of Doyle). No other TV episode tables were discovered.
- Director parsing: Treated each row’s "directed by" field as a single director identifier as stored. The distinct values observed appear to be single names per row (no multi-name entries to split).
