Summary
I verified the claim against the TabFact PostgreSQL database, specifically the public table t_1990_91_fa_cup, which contains columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", and "date".

Evidence from data
- Query intent: Find any row(s) where the home team is Woking and check the tie number and score.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower("home team") = 'woking';

- Result:
  - tie no: 5
  - home team: woking
  - score: 0 - 1
  - away team: everton

Assessment
- The data shows that for the home team "woking", the tie number is 5 and the score is 0 - 1. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "woking" as a case-insensitive match for the value in the "home team" column.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1990–91 FA Cup dataset represented by table t_1990_91_fa_cup.
