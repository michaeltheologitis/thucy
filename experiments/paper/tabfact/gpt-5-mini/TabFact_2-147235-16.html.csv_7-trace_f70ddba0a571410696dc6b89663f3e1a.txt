Claim to verify: “斤 and 担 / 擔 both have the same relative value.”

Step 1 — Explore available data sources
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with a public schema.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.chinese_units_of_measurement with columns: jyutping (text), character (text), portuguese (text), relative value (text), metric value (text), imperial value (text).

Step 2 — Retrieve entries for 斤 and 担/擔
Query 1 (exact SQL executed):
SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value"
FROM chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character IN ('斤', '担', '擔');
Returned rows:
[{"character":"斤","imperial value":"~1.3333lb","jyutping":"gan1","metric value":"604.78982 g","relative value":"1"}]
Interpretation: Table contains a row for 斤 with relative value = 1; no separate rows returned for '担' or '擔' individually.

Query 2 (to find combined entry for 担/擔) — exact SQL executed:
SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value"
FROM chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character LIKE '%担%' OR character LIKE '%擔%';
Returned rows:
[{"character":"担 / 擔","imperial value":"~133.3333lb","jyutping":"daam3","metric value":"60.478982 kg","relative value":"100"}]
Interpretation: The table stores 担 and 擔 together as “担 / 擔” with relative value = 100.

Step 3 — Cross-check relative and metric values’ ratio
Query 3 (exact SQL executed):
WITH vals AS (
 SELECT character, "metric value" as metric,
 regexp_replace("metric value",'[^0-9.]','','g')::numeric as num,
 CASE 
  WHEN "metric value" ILIKE '%kg' THEN regexp_replace("metric value",'[^0-9.]','','g')::numeric * 1000
  WHEN "metric value" ILIKE '%g' THEN regexp_replace("metric value",'[^0-9.]','','g')::numeric
  ELSE NULL END as grams
 FROM chinese_units_of_measurement
 WHERE character IN ('斤','担 / 擔')
)
SELECT v.character, v.metric, v.grams, v.grams / (SELECT grams FROM vals WHERE character='斤') as ratio_to_jin
FROM vals v;
Returned rows:
[{"character":"斤","grams":604.78982,"metric":"604.78982 g","ratio_to_jin":1.00000000000000000000},
 {"character":"担 / 擔","grams":60478.982000,"metric":"60.478982 kg","ratio_to_jin":100.0000000000000000}]
Interpretation: 担 / 擔 is 100× 斤 by metric mass as well.

Assessment
- From the “relative value” column: 斤 = 1; 担 / 擔 = 100. They do not have the same relative value. 担 / 擔 is 100 times a 斤.
- Metric and imperial values corroborate this 100× relationship.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. 斤 and 担 / 擔 do not have the same relative value; 担 / 擔 = 100 × 斤.

Assumptions
- The table consolidates simplified and traditional forms into a single entry “担 / 擔”. This combined row is used to represent both characters the user referenced.
