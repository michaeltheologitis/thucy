Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and schema.
- Queried the only available table (public.uruguayan_air_force) for Beechcraft entries and specifically for the B58 Baron to check model and in-service counts.

What the data shows
- The dataset is a single table named public.uruguayan_air_force containing aircraft inventory-style fields (aircraft, origin, type, versions, in service). This implies the counts refer to the Uruguayan Air Force, not the United States.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Broad search for Beechcraft and B58
Executed SQL:
SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service"
FROM public.uruguayan_air_force
WHERE LOWER(aircraft) LIKE '%beechcraft%'
   OR LOWER(versions) LIKE '%beechcraft%'
   OR LOWER(aircraft) LIKE '%b58%'
   OR LOWER(versions) LIKE '%b58%';

Results (aircraft | versions | in service):
- beechcraft twin bonanza | d50 | 1
- beechcraft b58 baron | b - 58 | 2

2) Targeted lookup of Beechcraft B58 Baron
Executed SQL:
SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%Beechcraft B58 Baron%';

Returned row:
- aircraft: beechcraft b58 baron
- versions: b - 58
- in service: 2

Assessment of the claim
- “with 2 in service … the Beechcraft represent the B58 model aircraft”: Supported by the data. The entry is “beechcraft b58 baron” (B58 model) and shows “in service: 2”.
- “by the US”: Not supported by the available data. The table is explicitly about the Uruguayan Air Force; the “in service: 2” pertains to Uruguay, not the United States.

Conclusion
- The data confirms that there are 2 Beechcraft B58 Baron aircraft in service in the Uruguayan Air Force. It does not provide evidence that these are “by the US.” Therefore, the claim mixes a correct count/model with an incorrect operator.

Assumptions made
- I interpreted the operator context from the table name (uruguayan_air_force) because the table lacks an explicit “country/operator” column. I assumed “in service” refers to that operator.
