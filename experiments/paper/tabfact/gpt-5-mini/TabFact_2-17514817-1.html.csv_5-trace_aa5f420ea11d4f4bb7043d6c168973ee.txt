Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Good Old Boy beer did not win a single award between 1995 and 2009.”

Finding: The data shows multiple awards for Good Old Boy within 1995–2009, contradicting the claim.

Data source discovery
- Discovered PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.west_berkshire_brewery with columns: year, beer name, prize, category, competition.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve all awards entries for Good Old Boy (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE LOWER(TRIM("beer name")) = LOWER(TRIM('Good Old Boy'));
Results (5 rows):
- 1995 | good old boy | overall winner | beer of the festival | camra white horse branch beer festival
- 2002 | good old boy | gold medal | best bitter | siba south east region beer competition
- 2002 | good old boy | second reserve champion | overall | siba south east region beer competition
- 2005 | good old boy | silver medal | best bitter | siba south east region beer competition
- 2009 | good old boy | gold medal | in category | camra london and south east regional competition

2) Count awards for Good Old Boy between 1995 and 2009 inclusive (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 AND lower(trim("beer name")) = lower('Good Old Boy');
Result: count = 5

Conclusion
- There are 5 documented awards for Good Old Boy in the period 1995–2009 (inclusive), so the claim that it did not win a single award in that time frame is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Between 1995 and 2009” interpreted as inclusive of both endpoints.
- Beer name matched case-insensitively with trimmed whitespace to avoid casing discrepancies in the source data.
