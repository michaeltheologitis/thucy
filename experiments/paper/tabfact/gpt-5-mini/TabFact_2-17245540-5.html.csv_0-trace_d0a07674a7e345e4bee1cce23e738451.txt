Summary
- Claim interpreted: “Gene Borek is from the United States.”
- Data environment explored: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact), public schema, containing a tournament table t_1973_u_s_open_golf with columns: place, player, country, score, to par.

Evidence
1) Search for “Borek” in the player column and report their country
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%borek%';

Result (as returned by the database):
- place: t6
- player: gene borek
- country: united states
- score: 77 + 65 = 142
- to par: e

Assessment
- The table explicitly lists a player named “gene borek” with country recorded as “united states.” This directly supports the claim that Gene Borek is from the United States.

Conclusion
- The available data supports the claim without contradiction.

Assumptions
- The phrase “be from the united state” is taken to mean nationality/country equals United States.
- The “country” column in this tournament table reflects the person’s country/nationality.
