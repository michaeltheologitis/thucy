Claim to verify: "there be only 3 highest rank list in the table"

How I interpreted the claim
- The table identified by the schema contains a column named "highest rank". I interpret the claim as asserting either:
  1) There are exactly 3 distinct values in the "highest rank" column; or
  2) There are exactly 3 rows associated with the highest-rank category.

Data source discovery and schema grounding
- Available data source: postgres_tabfact4 (public schema).
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.list_of_sumo_record_holders with columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), "highest rank" (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Total number of rows in the table
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
- Result:
  total_rows = 12

2) Count of distinct values in the "highest rank" column
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "highest rank") AS distinct_highest_rank_count FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
- Result:
  distinct_highest_rank_count = 2

3) Distinct "highest rank" values with their frequencies
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "highest rank", COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  GROUP BY "highest rank"
  ORDER BY frequency DESC, "highest rank" ASC;
- Result:
  - ōzeki: 6
  - sekiwake: 6

Assessment against the claim
- Interpretation (1): The claim that there are only 3 distinct "highest rank" values is contradicted. The data show exactly 2 distinct values (ōzeki and sekiwake).
- Interpretation (2): If the claim intends that there are only 3 rows at the highest rank category, the data also contradict this, as each of the two categories appears 6 times. Without an explicit ordering between these textual ranks in the data, we cannot define a single "highest" category from the table alone. However, under any tie-based interpretation, counts are not equal to 3.

Conclusion
- The table contains 12 rows with exactly 2 distinct values in "highest rank" (each occurring 6 times). The claim that there are only 3 "highest rank" entries/lists is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and interpretations
- "the table" refers to public.list_of_sumo_record_holders in the discovered postgres_tabfact4 database.
- "highest rank list" refers to the "highest rank" column, either as the number of distinct values or the count of rows having the top rank category. The data does not include a numeric or ordered ranking scale, so "top" cannot be derived from the table itself; counts are reported directly from the textual categories.
