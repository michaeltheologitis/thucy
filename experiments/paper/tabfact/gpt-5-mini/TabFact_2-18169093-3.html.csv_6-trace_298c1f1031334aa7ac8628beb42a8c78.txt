Claim to verify: “in the 1981 open championship there be 8 player that tie for 9th and 2 that tie for 3.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1981_open_championship.

Schema details (from public.t_1981_open_championship):
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text).
- No explicit year column (1981 is implied by the table name). No explicit tie flag; ties are encoded in the place text (e.g., ‘t9’ for tie for 9th).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Overview of places and counts to see tie distributions
SQL:
SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY place;
Result (as returned):
- place = t1 -> player_count = 2
- place = t3 -> player_count = 6
- place = t9 -> player_count = 8

(Alternative ordering by numeric position for confirmation)
SQL:
SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS player_count, substr(place, 2)::INT AS pos
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY pos;
Result (as returned):
- place = t1 -> player_count = 2 (pos = 1)
- place = t3 -> player_count = 6 (pos = 3)
- place = t9 -> player_count = 8 (pos = 9)

2) Direct counts for the specific positions in the claim
- For tie for 9th:
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't9';
Result: 8

- For tie for 3rd:
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't3';
Result: 6

Assessment of the claim:
- “8 player that tie for 9th”: Supported by the data (count = 8 for place = 't9').
- “2 that tie for 3”: Contradicted by the data (count = 6 for place = 't3', not 2).

Conclusion: One part of the claim is correct (tie for 9th = 8 players), but the other part is incorrect (tie for 3rd = 6 players, not 2).

Assumptions made:
- The place column encodes ties using a lowercase ‘t’ followed by the numeric finishing position (e.g., 't3' means tie for 3rd). This interpretation is consistent with the observed data.
- The year 1981 is inferred from the table name t_1981_open_championship.
- The TabFact database is treated as authoritative for this verification task.
