Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and schema.
- Queried the relevant table to find any character identified as a DEA agent and checked their listed final episode.

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact22 (public schema)
  - Tables: list_of_csi_miami_characters(character text, position text, actor text, "first episode" text, "final episode" text, duration text, "final episode count" bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the DEA agent entry and its final episode
- SQL:
  SELECT character, "final episode", position
  FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters
  WHERE position ILIKE '%DEA%' OR character ILIKE '%DEA%';
- Result:
  - character: bob keaton
  - final episode: vengeance
  - position: dea agent

2) Confirm details for the matched character
- SQL:
  SELECT character, position, "final episode"
  FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters
  WHERE lower(character) = 'bob keaton';
- Result:
  - character: bob keaton
  - position: dea agent
  - final episode: vengeance

Conclusion
- The table of CSI: Miami characters shows that the character who is a DEA agent (Bob Keaton) has the final episode titled "vengeance." This supports the claim that the final episode for the DEA agent is titled "Vengeance."

Assumptions
- Interpreted "dea agent" as referring to the CSI: Miami character whose position is listed as "dea agent."
- Interpreted "final episode" as the value in the "final episode" column of the characters table.
