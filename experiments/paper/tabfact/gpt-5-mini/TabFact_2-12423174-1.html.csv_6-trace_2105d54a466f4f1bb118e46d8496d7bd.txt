Claim to verify: “the young african score zero point in the 1971 african cup of champion club.”

Summary conclusion: The 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs was a knockout competition decided by two-legged aggregate scores (not a points-based league). Young Africans appear in the dataset and won their tie 2–0 on aggregate. The claim that they “scored zero point” is not applicable to this format and contradicted by the match data showing they advanced.

Data sources inspected
- Database: postgres_tabfact12
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs with columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify Young Africans’ matches in 1971
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" 
  FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Young Africans%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Young Africans%';
- Result:
  - team 1: young africans | agg: 2 - 0 | team 2: lavori publici | 1st leg: 2 - 0 | 2nd leg: 0 - 0
- Interpretation: Young Africans defeated Lavori Publici 2–0 on aggregate (won the first leg 2–0, drew the second leg 0–0).

2) Confirm the competition format (aggregate ties, not points)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;
- Sample results illustrating format (two legs + aggregate, including a penalty shootout when tied):
  - al - merrikh vs tele sc asmara — 1st leg 2–1, 2nd leg 0–1, agg 2–2 (5–4 pen)
  - canon yaoundé vs as solidarité — 1st leg 7–3, 2nd leg 2–1, agg 9–4
  - young africans vs lavori publici — 1st leg 2–0, 2nd leg 0–0, agg 2–0
- Interpretation: The dataset records knockout ties decided by aggregate score (and penalties if needed). There is no evidence of a league table or points being used in this competition.

Assessment
- The competition did not use a points system; therefore, stating any team “scored zero point” is not meaningful in this context.
- Moreover, Young Africans won their tie 2–0 on aggregate, which contradicts the notion of poor performance implied by “zero point.” They progressed from at least one round.

Final judgment: The claim is inaccurate based on the available, authoritative dataset.

Assumptions
- “Young African” refers to Young Africans SC (Tanzania).
- “Score zero point” is interpreted as accumulating zero points in a competition; in this knockout format, points are not applicable.
- Matching used case-insensitive search for “Young Africans.”
