Claim to verify: “Among the players in DF position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact20 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
  - Key columns: name (text), position (text), league goals (bigint)

Evidence
1) Identify all DF players and their league goals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position = 'df' ORDER BY "league goals" DESC, name ASC;
- Result (name — league goals):
  1) dave sutton — 6
  2) keith hanvey — 2
  3) malcolm brown — 2
  4) fred robinson — 1
  5) bernard purdie — 0
  6) chris topping — 0
  7) jim branagan — 0
- Note: The tool first checked how position values are stored (lowercase) via:
  SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY position;

2) Confirm the maximum league goals among DF players and who holds it
- Executed SQL (max goals among DF):
  SELECT MAX("league goals") AS max_goals FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(position) = 'df';
- Result: max_goals = 6
- Executed SQL (player(s) with that max):
  SELECT name, position, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(position) = 'df' AND "league goals" = 6;
- Result: dave sutton, df, 6

3) Directly confirm Dave Sutton’s row
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, position, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE '%Dave%Sutton%';
- Result: name = dave sutton, position = df, league goals = 6

Conclusion
- Dave Sutton, a DF, has 6 league goals, which is the highest among all DF-position players in this dataset (next highest is 2). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the dataset at hand (Huddersfield Town F.C. 1979–80 season table).
- “DF” corresponds to defenders stored as 'df' in the position column; case-insensitive matching was applied where relevant.
- “League goal” refers to the “league goals” column in this table.
