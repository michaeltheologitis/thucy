Data sources discovered
- TabFact PostgreSQL instance with one relevant table: public.olga_govortsova.

Step 1: Inspect Olga Govortsova’s Grand Slam results in the available table
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;

Result (relevant rows):
- {tournament: "australian open", 2007: "a", 2008: "1r", 2009: "1r", 2010: "1r", 2011: "1r"}
- {tournament: "french open", 2007: "a", 2008: "3r", 2009: "3r", 2010: "2r", 2011: "2r"}
- {tournament: "wimbledon", 2007: "2r", 2008: "1r", 2009: "2r", 2010: "1r", 2011: "1r"}
- {tournament: "us open", 2007: "2r", 2008: "2r", 2009: "1r", 2010: "1r", 2011: "1r"}
(Additional rows in the table concern other tournaments and summary lines.)

Step 2: Compute the deepest Grand Slam round recorded in this table (2007–2011)
Executed SQL:
WITH gs AS (
  SELECT tournament, '2007' AS year, lower("2007") AS result FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2008', lower("2008") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2009', lower("2009") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2010', lower("2010") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2011', lower("2011") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
), mapped AS (
  SELECT *,
    CASE
      WHEN result IN ('w','winner','win','w/o') THEN 8
      WHEN result IN ('f') THEN 7
      WHEN result IN ('sf') THEN 6
      WHEN result IN ('qf') THEN 5
      WHEN result IN ('4r') THEN 4
      WHEN result IN ('3r') THEN 3
      WHEN result IN ('2r') THEN 2
      WHEN result IN ('1r') THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END AS depth
  FROM gs
)
SELECT max(depth) AS max_depth FROM mapped;

Result:
- max_depth = 3

Executed SQL to list which events hit that maximum:
WITH gs AS (
  SELECT tournament, '2007' AS year, lower("2007") AS result FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2008', lower("2008") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2009', lower("2009") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2010', lower("2010") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
  UNION ALL SELECT tournament, '2011', lower("2011") FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
), mapped AS (
  SELECT *,
    CASE
      WHEN result IN ('w','winner','win','w/o') THEN 8
      WHEN result IN ('f') THEN 7
      WHEN result IN ('sf') THEN 6
      WHEN result IN ('qf') THEN 5
      WHEN result IN ('4r') THEN 4
      WHEN result IN ('3r') THEN 3
      WHEN result IN ('2r') THEN 2
      WHEN result IN ('1r') THEN 1
      ELSE 0 END AS depth
  FROM gs
)
SELECT tournament, year, result FROM mapped WHERE depth = (SELECT max(depth) FROM mapped) ORDER BY tournament, year;

Result:
- {tournament: "french open", year: "2008", result: "3r"}
- {tournament: "french open", year: "2009", result: "3r"}

Conclusion from available data (2007–2011): The furthest Grand Slam round recorded for Olga Govortsova in this dataset is the third round (3R), achieved at the French Open in 2008 and 2009.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The only accessible dataset covers results labeled by year columns 2007–2011. No data beyond 2011 is available here, so “ever” is interpreted within the scope of this table.
- Round codes were mapped as: 1R<2R<3R<4R<QF<SF<F<W. Values not matching these codes were treated as non-round entries.
