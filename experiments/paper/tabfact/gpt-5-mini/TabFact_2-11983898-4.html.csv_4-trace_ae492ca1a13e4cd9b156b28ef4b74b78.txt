Claim to verify:
"Federico Delbonis was the opponent in the final of the 28 July 2013 tournament, which did not have a clay surface."

What the data shows (from public.fabio_fognini):
- For date 28 July 2013: the tournament is "atp vegeta croatia open umag , umag , croatia"; surface is "clay"; opponent in the final is "tommy robredo".
- For date 21 July 2013: the tournament is "international german open , hamburg , germany"; surface is "clay"; opponent in the final is "federico delbonis".

Assessment of the claim’s components:
- Opponent on 28 July 2013: Data shows Tommy Robredo, not Federico Delbonis. This part is false.
- Surface on 28 July 2013: Data shows clay. The claim says it was not clay. This part is false.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL:
1) Identify available 2013 dates in the table
Query:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.fabio_fognini WHERE date ILIKE '%2013%';
Result:
[ { "date": "14 july 2013" }, { "date": "21 july 2013" }, { "date": "28 july 2013" } ]

2) Retrieve tournament, surface, and opponent for 28 July 2013
Query:
SELECT tournament, surface, "opponent in the final" FROM public.fabio_fognini WHERE date = '28 july 2013';
Result:
[ { "opponent in the final": "tommy robredo", "surface": "clay", "tournament": "atp vegeta croatia open umag , umag , croatia" } ]

3) Cross-check the row where Federico Delbonis was the final opponent in 2013
Query:
SELECT tournament, surface, "opponent in the final" FROM public.fabio_fognini WHERE date = '21 july 2013';
Result:
[ { "tournament": "international german open , hamburg , germany", "surface": "clay", "opponent in the final": "federico delbonis" } ]

Conclusion:
Both key elements of the claim are contradicted by the data: the 28 July 2013 final opponent was Tommy Robredo (not Federico Delbonis), and the surface was clay (not non-clay).

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to the Fabio Fognini results contained in the available table public.fabio_fognini.
- The date provided by the user ("28 July 2013") was matched to the text-stored date value "28 july 2013" case-insensitively.
