Claim: “The Denver Broncos and the Chicago Bears play at the RCA Dome, ending in the Broncos’ favor with a score of 23–8.”

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (public schema) containing: nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present — NBC Sunday Night Football game results from 2006–present.

Step 1 — Understand table structure (sample rows)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "final score", "host team", stadium
FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
LIMIT 10;
Observation: Final score is stored as text in the format “visiting score - host score”; team and stadium names are lowercase.

Step 2 — Direct check for Broncos vs Bears at RCA Dome
Executed SQL:
SELECT "date", "visiting team", "host team", "final score", "stadium"
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "stadium" ILIKE 'RCA Dome'
  AND (
    ("visiting team" ILIKE '%Denver Broncos%' AND "host team" ILIKE '%Chicago Bears%')
    OR ("visiting team" ILIKE '%Chicago Bears%' AND "host team" ILIKE '%Denver Broncos%')
  );
Result: No rows. There is no Broncos vs Bears game at the RCA Dome in this dataset.

Step 3 — Confirm how RCA Dome appears and list SNF games at RCA Dome
Executed SQL (distinct name check):
SELECT DISTINCT "stadium" FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present WHERE "stadium" ILIKE '%RCA%';
Result: rca dome

Executed SQL (all RCA Dome games):
SELECT "date", "visiting team", "host team", "final score", "stadium"
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "stadium" ILIKE 'rca dome';
Results:
- november 26 — philadelphia eagles @ indianapolis colts — 21 - 45 — rca dome
- january 6 — kansas city chiefs @ indianapolis colts — 8 - 23 — rca dome
Observation: None involve Denver or Chicago.

Step 4 — Search for a 23–8 (or 8–23) score in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", "final score", stadium
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "final score" IN ('23 - 8', '8 - 23')
ORDER BY date;
Results:
- january 6 — kansas city chiefs @ indianapolis colts — 8 - 23 — rca dome
Executed SQL (counts):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_23_8 FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present WHERE "final score" = '23 - 8';
Result: 0
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_8_23 FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present WHERE "final score" = '8 - 23';
Result: 1
Observation: The only 23–8-equivalent score at the RCA Dome is Chiefs @ Colts (Colts won 23–8), not Broncos vs Bears.

Step 5 — Check whether Broncos vs Bears appears at all in this SNF dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE ("visiting team" = 'Denver Broncos' AND "host team" = 'Chicago Bears')
   OR ("visiting team" = 'Chicago Bears' AND "host team" = 'Denver Broncos');
Result: 0
Observation: Broncos vs Bears does not occur in this table (SNF 2006–present).

Step 6 — Context: Broncos and Bears do appear individually, but not vs each other nor at RCA Dome
Executed SQL (Broncos in SNF dataset):
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", "final score", stadium
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "visiting team" = 'denver broncos' OR "host team" = 'denver broncos'
ORDER BY date;
Results include games at gillette stadium and invesco field at mile high, not rca dome.

Executed SQL (Bears in SNF dataset):
SELECT date, "visiting team" AS visiting_team, "host team" AS host_team, "final score" AS final_score, stadium
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "visiting team" ILIKE '%Chicago Bears%' OR "host team" ILIKE '%Chicago Bears%'
ORDER BY date;
Results include games at soldier field and giants stadium, not rca dome.

Conclusion
- The NBC Sunday Night Football dataset (2006–present) contains no game where the Denver Broncos played the Chicago Bears at the RCA Dome.
- The only SNF game at the RCA Dome with a 23–8-equivalent score is Kansas City Chiefs @ Indianapolis Colts (8–23), with the Colts winning — not the Broncos over the Bears.
- Therefore, based on the authoritative data available, the claim is contradicted.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset of NBC Sunday Night Football games (2006–present). If the claim refers to a non-SNF game or a different era, it would fall outside this data; however, the venue (RCA Dome — Indianapolis) hosting Broncos vs Bears would itself be atypical, further undermining the claim within reasonable expectations.
