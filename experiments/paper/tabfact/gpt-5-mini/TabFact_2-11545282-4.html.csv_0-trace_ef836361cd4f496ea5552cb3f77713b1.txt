Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources.
- Identified a Utah Jazz all-time roster table.
- Queried for players with the last name “Dawkins” and reviewed their seasons with the Jazz to check for overlap.

Data source discovery
- Available DB: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)

Schema used
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence 1: Retrieve Jazz players with last name Dawkins
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '% Dawkins';
- Result:
  - darryl dawkins — center — 1987 - 88
  - paul dawkins — guard — 1979 - 80

Evidence 2: Confirm no additional variants of the name and list seasons
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower(player) LIKE '%dawkins%';
- Result:
  - darryl dawkins — 1987 - 88
  - paul dawkins — 1979 - 80

Analysis
- The Utah Jazz all-time roster lists exactly two players with the surname Dawkins: Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins.
- Their listed seasons with the Jazz are 1979–80 (Paul) and 1987–88 (Darryl), which do not overlap.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported: the Jazz have two players with the last name Dawkins, and their tenures with the team do not overlap.

Assumptions
- "The jazz" refers to the NBA’s Utah Jazz.
- "Time on the team" is interpreted as the seasons listed in the "years for jazz" field in the utah_jazz_all_time_roster table.
