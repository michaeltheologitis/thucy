Claim to verify: "tommy smith have he highest number of league goal"

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact27 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (contains per-player stats including “league goals” for Huddersfield Town’s 1979–80 season)

Evidence collected
1) All players’ league goals ordered descending
SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY "league goals" DESC, name ASC;
Key results (top and relevant rows):
- ian robins — 25
- peter fletcher — 17
- steve kindon — 14
- …
- tommy smith — 0

2) Maximum league goals and the player(s) who achieved it
SQL:
SELECT MAX("league goals") AS max_league_goals FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;
Result: max_league_goals = 25

SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "league goals" = 25;
Result: name = ian robins, league goals = 25

3) Tommy Smith’s league goals
SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE lower(name) = lower('Tommy Smith');
Result: name = tommy smith, league goals = 0

Conclusion
- In the only available dataset (Huddersfield Town 1979–80 season), Tommy Smith scored 0 league goals, while the top scorer was Ian Robins with 25. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “highest number of league goal” as “the most league goals” within the scope of the available dataset (the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town season).
- Interpreted “tommy smith” as the row labeled “tommy smith” in this table. No other Tommy Smith entries exist in this dataset.
