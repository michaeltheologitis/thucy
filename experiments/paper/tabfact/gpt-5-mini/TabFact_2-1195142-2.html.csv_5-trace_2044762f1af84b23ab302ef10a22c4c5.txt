Conclusion: No. William Ivey Long did not win the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography. The 2005 winner in that category was Jerry Mitchell. In 2005, William Ivey Long was a nominee for Drama Desk Outstanding Costume Design (and for the Tony Award for Best Costume Design), not a choreography award winner.

Evidence from the database
1) Who won Drama Desk Outstanding Choreography in 2005?
- Result row:
  - year: 2005, award: drama desk award, category: outstanding choreography, nominee: jerry mitchell, result: won
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE year = 2005
  AND award ILIKE 'Drama Desk Award%'
  AND category ILIKE '%choreograph%';

2) Was William Ivey Long listed in 2005 and for what?
- Result rows:
  - 2005, tony award, best costume design, william ivey long, nominated
  - 2005, drama desk award, outstanding costume design, william ivey long, nominated
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE year = 2005
  AND (
    award ILIKE '%William Ivey Long%'
    OR category ILIKE '%William Ivey Long%'
    OR nominee ILIKE '%William Ivey Long%'
    OR result ILIKE '%William Ivey Long%'
);

How this supports the verdict
- The 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography entry shows Jerry Mitchell as the winner, not William Ivey Long.
- William Ivey Long appears in 2005 award records as a nominee for Outstanding Costume Design (Drama Desk) and Best Costume Design (Tony), not for choreography and not as a winner.

Assumptions
- The queryable awards table (la_cage_aux_folles_musical) is authoritative for the relevant 2005 Drama Desk/Tony outcomes associated with La Cage aux Folles.
- The misspelling “willam ivey long” refers to William Ivey Long, the costume designer.
