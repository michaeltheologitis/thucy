Claim to verify: "only 1 person have be a member of the socialist party of albania"

Summary conclusion: The available data show multiple prime ministers affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania—far more than one. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public containing table list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Findings: Table public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania with columns (all text): name, born - died, term start, term end, political party.

Evidence 1: Distribution of political party values in the prime ministers table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "political party", COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  GROUP BY "political party"
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result (party: count):
  - socialist party of albania: 8
  - democratic party of albania: 2
  - party of labour of albania: 1
  - prime ministers 1991 onwards: 1
  - non - party: 1
- Interpretation: Rows associated with the Socialist Party of Albania appear 8 times in the prime ministers list.

Evidence 2: Count of distinct prime ministers affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania
- Executed SQL (as-is names, listing distinct rows):
  SELECT DISTINCT name, "political party" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" ILIKE '%socialist%';
- Returned 8 rows corresponding to these names (including repeat terms denoted in parentheses): bashkim fino; edi rama; fatos nano (2nd time); fatos nano (3rd time); ilir meta; pandeli majko (1st time); pandeli majko (2nd time); ylli bufi.

- Executed SQL (normalize away parenthetical term markers to count distinct people):
  SELECT DISTINCT split_part(name, ' (', 1) AS base_name FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" ILIKE '%socialist%';
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT split_part(name, ' (', 1)) AS distinct_base_names_count FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" ILIKE '%socialist%';
- Result: 6 distinct individuals: bashkim fino, edi rama, fatos nano, ilir meta, pandeli majko, ylli bufi.

Assessment
- Even restricting to the prime ministers dataset, there are at least six distinct individuals affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania, not just one. The claim is therefore contradicted by the authoritative data available.

Conclusion
- Verdict: The claim is inaccurate according to the data on Albanian prime ministers.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The discovered data source contains a table of Albanian prime ministers, not all citizens or all politicians. I interpreted the claim in the context of this available, authoritative dataset: among prime ministers of Albania, more than one person (specifically six distinct individuals) are associated with the Socialist Party of Albania. This suffices to refute the claim as stated, which asserts “only 1 person.”
