Claim assessed: "the zakspeed 891 chassis have multiple yamaha v8 engine"

Data sources explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact22 (TabFact), schema: public
- Identified relevant table: public.zakspeed (columns: year, chassis, "engine (s)", tyres, points)

Evidence gathered
1) Query to find entries for the 891 chassis:
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)" FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis = '891' OR chassis LIKE '%891%';
   Result:
   - year: 1989, chassis: zakspeed 891, engine(s): yamaha v8

Findings
- The data explicitly shows that the Zakspeed 891 (1989) used a Yamaha V8 engine.
- The dataset provides a single engine descriptor for the 891 entry: "yamaha v8". It does not list multiple engine types or versions for that chassis, nor does it provide counts that would substantiate “multiple” engines.

Conclusion
- Supported: Zakspeed 891 used a Yamaha V8 engine.
- Not supported by the data: the qualifier "multiple" (the table does not indicate more than one distinct Yamaha V8 engine for the 891 chassis).

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “have multiple yamaha v8 engine” as asserting more than one engine type or unit associated with the 891 chassis. The available table does not provide engine counts or multiple engine listings per chassis entry.
