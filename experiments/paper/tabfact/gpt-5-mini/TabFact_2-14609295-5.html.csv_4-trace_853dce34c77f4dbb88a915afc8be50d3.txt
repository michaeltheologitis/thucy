Summary conclusion: The earliest year in the available data with a win–loss record of 18-12 is 1980. No earlier year matches this record.

Data sources discovered:
- postgres_tabfact33, schema public, table: vcu_rams_men_s_basketball

Schema inspected:
- vcu_rams_men_s_basketball(year bigint, record text, seed bigint, region text, results text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all rows whose record is 18-12 (ignoring spaces around the dash), ordered by year ascending
- SQL:
  SELECT year, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE record ~ '^[[:space:]]*18[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*12[[:space:]]*$' ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result:
  [{"year":1980, "record":"18 - 12"}]

2) Compute the earliest year among those matches
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_year FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE record ~ '^[[:space:]]*18[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*12[[:space:]]*$';
- Result:
  [{"earliest_year":1980}]

3) Double-check allowing either hyphen or en dash and optional spaces, and count matches
- SQL (list matches):
  SELECT year, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE record ~ '^18\s*[\-–]\s*12$' ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result:
  [{"year":1980, "record":"18 - 12"}]
- SQL (count matches):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE record ~ '^18\s*[\-–]\s*12$';
- Result:
  [{"match_count":1}]

Interpretation:
- The only row with a record of 18-12 occurs in year 1980, making 1980 the earliest such year in this dataset.

Assumptions made:
- “Record of 18 - 12” refers to the win–loss string in the record column of public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball.
- Optional spaces around the dash and either a hyphen or en dash were treated as equivalent formatting variations.
- The claim pertains to the VCU Rams men’s basketball dataset that is the only available source here.
