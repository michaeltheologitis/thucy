Claim to verify: “there be 2 instance where there be a tie for most rebound by detroit piston player during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21), schema: public
- Relevant table (schema tool output): t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
  - Description indicates per-game season data for the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons

Step 1 — Inspect the period covered and the “high rebounds” formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "high rebounds", score
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
ORDER BY game;
Key returned rows (game | date | high rebounds):
- 62 | march 1  | greg monroe , charlie villanueva (9)
- 63 | march 2  | greg monroe (11)
- 64 | march 6  | greg monroe , rodney stuckey (7)
- 65 | march 9  | greg monroe (10)
- 66 | march 11 | greg monroe (10)
- 67 | march 12 | austin daye , ben gordon , greg monroe (6)
- 68 | march 16 | greg monroe (10)
- 69 | march 18 | chris wilcox (12)
- 70 | march 20 | greg monroe (10)
- 71 | march 23 | greg monroe (12)
- 72 | march 25 | chris wilcox , greg monroe (8)
- 73 | march 26 | greg monroe (13)
Observation: The available rows cover games 62–73 (March 2011). In “high rebounds,” multiple names separated by commas indicate a tie for team-high rebounds in that game.

Step 2 — Count games with any tie for team-high rebounds
Executed SQL (count ties by detecting a comma in the field):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tie_count FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%';
Result: tie_count = 4

Executed SQL (list the specific tie games):
SELECT game, date, "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%' ORDER BY game;
Returned rows:
- game 62 | march 1  | greg monroe , charlie villanueva (9)
- game 64 | march 6  | greg monroe , rodney stuckey (7)
- game 67 | march 12 | austin daye , ben gordon , greg monroe (6)
- game 72 | march 25 | chris wilcox , greg monroe (8)

Step 3 — Distinguish two-player ties vs three-player ties (for completeness)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (length(coalesce("high rebounds",'')) - length(replace(coalesce("high rebounds",''),',',''))) = 1) AS exactly_two_tied,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (length(coalesce("high rebounds",'')) - length(replace(coalesce("high rebounds",''),',',''))) >= 2) AS three_or_more_tied
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
Results:
- exactly_two_tied = 3
- three_or_more_tied = 1

Conclusion
- Within the available “period” (games 62–73, March 2011), there are 4 instances where Detroit Pistons players tied for most rebounds in a game. If “tie” is restricted to exactly two players, there are 3 such instances. Either way, the claimed “2 instances” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “This period” refers to the period represented by the available rows in the table (games 62–73, March 2011), as no broader season data is present in the accessible source.
- A tie for team-high rebounds is identified by multiple player names separated by commas in the “high rebounds” field.
- The table t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season is authoritative for this verification task.
