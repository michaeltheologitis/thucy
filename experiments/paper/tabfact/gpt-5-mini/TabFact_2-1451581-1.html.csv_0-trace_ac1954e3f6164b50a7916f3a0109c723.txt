Claim to verify: "shanghai pudong international airport rank 3rd with a total cargo load of 2939157 metric tonne"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema), containing table: world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic.

Schema confirmation:
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result:
- rank — bigint
- airport — text
- code (iata / icao) — text
- total cargo (metric tonnes) — bigint
- % change — text

Evidence query 1 (targeted check of rank and cargo for Shanghai Pudong):
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, "total cargo (metric tonnes)" FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic WHERE airport ILIKE '%Shanghai Pudong%';
Result:
- rank: 3
- total cargo (metric tonnes): 2939157

Evidence query 2 (full row for additional context):
Executed SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public."world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic"
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Shanghai Pudong%';
Result:
{"rank": 3, "airport": "shanghai pudong international airport", "code (iata / icao)": "pvg / zspd", "total cargo (metric tonnes)": 2939157, "% change": "5.3%"}

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists "shanghai pudong international airport" with rank = 3 and total cargo (metric tonnes) = 2,939,157. This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- The claim refers to the same scope as the dataset "world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic" (global busiest airports by cargo traffic). The dataset does not specify a year in the schema; verification is tied to this dataset’s snapshot. The phrase "metric tonne" is interpreted as the unit matching the column "total cargo (metric tonnes)".
