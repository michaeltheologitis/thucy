Data sources discovered:
- public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (public schema). Columns: year (bigint), record (text), seed (bigint), region (text), results (text).

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1996;
- Result:
  year: 1996
  seed: 12
  region: southeast
  results: l 51 - 58

Assessment:
- The data shows that in 1996 the VCU Rams men’s basketball team was a 12-seed in the Southeast region (and lost 51–58). The claim that they were the 2-seed in the Southeast region is contradicted by the data. While the region (Southeast) matches, the seed (2 vs. 12) does not.

Assumptions:
- “They” refers to the VCU Rams men’s basketball team, as the only available authoritative data source pertains to that team.
- The table’s year/seed/region fields correspond to NCAA tournament year, seed, and region.
