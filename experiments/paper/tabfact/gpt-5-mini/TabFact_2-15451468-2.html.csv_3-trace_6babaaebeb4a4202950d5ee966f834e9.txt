Claim interpreted: “62936 be the highest attendance for the whole week.” Given the available data source (a single table of the 1970 New York Giants season with one game per week), I interpret this as: Is 62,936 the highest attendance across all weeks (i.e., the season) in the available dataset?

Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_1970_new_york_giants_season with columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance.

Evidence from data:
1) Maximum attendance across the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM t_1970_new_york_giants_season;
- Result: 69126

2) Top 5 games by attendance (to show relative position of 62936)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance
  FROM t_1970_new_york_giants_season
  ORDER BY attendance DESC NULLS LAST
  LIMIT 5;
- Results (descending attendance):
  1. week: 3, date: 1970 - 10 - 04, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 14 - 10, game site: tulane stadium, attendance: 69126
  2. week: 7, date: 1970 - 11 - 01, opponent: new york jets, result: w 22 - 10, game site: shea stadium, attendance: 63903
  3. week: 6, date: 1970 - 10 - 25, opponent: st louis cardinals, result: w 35 - 17, game site: yankee stadium, attendance: 62984
  4. week: 8, date: 1970 - 11 - 08, opponent: dallas cowboys, result: w 23 - 20, game site: yankee stadium, attendance: 62938
  5. week: 1, date: 1970 - 09 - 19, opponent: chicago bears, result: l 24 - 16, game site: yankee stadium, attendance: 62936

Conclusion:
- The highest attendance in the dataset is 69,126, not 62,936. The value 62,936 is present (week 1) but is not the maximum.

Assumptions:
- “Whole week” is interpreted as “across all weeks (the entire season) in the available t_1970_new_york_giants_season table,” since no broader league-wide weekly attendance data is available in the connected data source.
