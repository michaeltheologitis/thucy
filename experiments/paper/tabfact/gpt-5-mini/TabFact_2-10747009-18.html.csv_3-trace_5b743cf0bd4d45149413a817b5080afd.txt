Claim assessed: "prince park have footscray as its home team"

Summary of findings based on available data (TabFact, public.t_1927_vfl_season):
- The venue appears in the data as "princes park".
- In the 1927 VFL season data available, the only match recorded at "princes park" lists Carlton as the home team, not Footscray.
- Footscray’s recorded home match in this dataset was played at "western oval".

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify exact venue naming in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season ORDER BY venue;
Result (subset): includes "princes park".

2) Which home teams played at "princes park" (and how many matches)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", COUNT(*) AS matches_at_princes_park
FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) = 'princes park'
GROUP BY "home team"
ORDER BY matches_at_princes_park DESC, "home team";
Result: carlton — 1

3) Check explicitly if Footscray was ever the home team at "princes park"
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season WHERE lower(venue) = 'princes park' AND lower("home team") = 'footscray';
Result: cnt = 0

4) Show the full record(s) at "princes park"
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season WHERE lower(venue) = 'princes park';
Result: Date: 10 september 1927; Home team: carlton; Home team score: 15.16 (106); Away team: st kilda; Away team score: 7.9 (51); Venue: princes park; Crowd: 24000

5) Where did Footscray play as the home team?
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") = 'footscray'
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY match_count DESC, venue;
Result: western oval — 1

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows Carlton, not Footscray, as the home team at Princes Park for the recorded match. No evidence supports Footscray being the home team at Princes Park in this data. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions:
- "prince park" refers to the venue recorded as "princes park" in the dataset.
- Verification is limited to the available 1927 VFL season table; no other seasons or sources are present in the connected data.
