Summary conclusion
- The data shows that the largest goal differential (interpreting “point gap” as the absolute difference in goals scored between the two teams in a game) occurred once, not twice. Therefore, there was no tie for the largest point gap within the available season dataset.

What data was examined
- Database: postgres_tabfact12
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season (columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record)
- Scope note: The table contains 14 games (appears to cover a portion of the 2003–04 season rather than the full season).

Method
- Parsed the score text of the form "X - Y" to extract visitor and home goals.
- Computed absolute goal differential per game as abs(visitor_goals − home_goals).
- Identified the maximum differential and counted how many games reached that maximum.

Findings supported by executed SQL
1) Inspect score format and sample rows
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  LIMIT 10;
- Result (sample) confirms score format like "4 - 1", "1 - 3", etc.

2) Count total games in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: 14 games.

3) Compute maximum goal differential and how many games reached it
- SQL executed:
  WITH diffs AS (
    SELECT abs((split_part(score,' - ',1)::int) - (split_part(score,' - ',2)::int)) AS diff
    FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  )
  SELECT max(diff) AS max_diff, count(*) FILTER (WHERE diff = (SELECT max(diff) FROM diffs)) AS games_with_max
  FROM diffs;
- Result: max_diff = 6; games_with_max = 1.

4) Distribution of goal differentials
- SQL executed:
  SELECT abs( (CAST(split_part(replace(score,' ',''),'-',1) AS integer)) - (CAST(split_part(replace(score,' ',''),'-',2) AS integer)) ) AS diff, count(*) AS games
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  GROUP BY diff
  ORDER BY diff DESC;
- Result (diff, games): (6, 1), (3, 4), (2, 2), (1, 3), (0, 4).

5) List the game(s) with the maximum differential
- SQL executed:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision,
      (CAST(trim(split_part(score, '-') , '99') AS int))
    )
  )
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, diff
  FROM parsed
  JOIN (SELECT max(diff) AS max_diff FROM parsed) m ON parsed.diff = m.max_diff
  ORDER BY date;
  [Note: The actual executed version included parsing steps as shown in the tool output.]
- Actual executed SQL (as run by the tool):
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision,
      (CAST(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)) AS int)) AS visitor_goals,
      (CAST(trim(split_part(score, '-', 2)) AS int)) AS home_goals,
      abs((CAST(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)) AS int)) - (CAST(trim(split_part(score, '-', 2)) AS int))) AS diff
    FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  ), m AS (
    SELECT max(diff) AS max_diff FROM parsed
  )
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, diff
  FROM parsed JOIN m ON parsed.diff = m.max_diff
  ORDER BY date;
- Result: january 5, nashville, 0 - 6, detroit, joseph (diff = 6).

Conclusion
- The largest point gap (goal differential) in the available season dataset is 6, and it occurred once. There was no tie for the largest point gap occurring twice. The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Point gap” is interpreted as game goal differential (absolute difference in goals scored by the two teams).
- “During the season” is interpreted as “within the set of games provided by the available table,” which contains 14 games for the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings (likely a partial season segment). All conclusions are based strictly on this dataset.
