Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact10/TabFact) with one relevant table: public.media_in_kelowna.
- Reviewed the schema: media_in_kelowna has columns [frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner].
- Queried for radio stations with the format “Adult Hits” and inspected the owner field.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find all stations with format = 'Adult Hits' (case-insensitive) and show their owners
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency, owner, format
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
WHERE TRIM(LOWER(format)) = 'adult hits';

Result:
- call sign: cjui - fm
  branding: 103.9 the juice
  frequency: 0 103.9 fm
  owner: vista broadcast group
  format: adult hits

Findings
- The table lists one station with the format “Adult Hits”: CJUI-FM (branding: 103.9 The Juice). Its owner is recorded as “vista broadcast group.”
