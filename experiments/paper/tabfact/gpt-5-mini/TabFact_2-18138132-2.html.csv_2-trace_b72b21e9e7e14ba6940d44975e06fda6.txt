Claim interpreted: “Facebook by Matchbox was released on 2010-12-16.”

Evidence from data
- Data source: TabFact database (public schema), table: list_of_zune_applications
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, developer, "release date", version
  FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
  WHERE title ILIKE 'facebook' AND developer ILIKE 'matchbox';
- Returned row:
  - title: facebook
  - developer: matchbox
  - release date: 2010 - 12 - 16
  - version: 1.4

Assessment
- The table contains an entry for title “facebook” by developer “matchbox” with release date “2010 - 12 - 16”. This matches the claim exactly, including the date.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the application listing in the list_of_zune_applications table (i.e., a Zune app entry).
- Case-insensitive matching was used for title and developer. The date is treated as stored text and compared verbatim.
