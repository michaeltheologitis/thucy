Scope and data sources explored:
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL source (TabFact, public schema). The only relevant table is public.brian_watts with columns: tournament, wins, top - 5, top - 25, events, cuts made.

Goal interpreted:
- Verify whether any tournament listed for Brian Watts shows a nonzero value in the wins column (i.e., whether any tournament resulted in a win).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Inspect all rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.brian_watts;
Result:
- {"tournament": "masters tournament", "wins": 0, "top - 5": 0, "top - 25": 0, "events": 2, "cuts made": 1}
- {"tournament": "us open", "wins": 0, "top - 5": 0, "top - 25": 1, "events": 2, "cuts made": 1}
- {"tournament": "the open championship", "wins": 0, "top - 5": 1, "top - 25": 2, "events": 7, "cuts made": 4}
- {"tournament": "pga championship", "wins": 0, "top - 5": 0, "top - 25": 0, "events": 6, "cuts made": 4}
- {"tournament": "totals", "wins": 0, "top - 5": 1, "top - 25": 3, "events": 17, "cuts made": 10}

2) Count rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.brian_watts;
Result:
- total_rows: 5

3) Count rows where wins > 0
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_wins_gt_0 FROM public.brian_watts WHERE wins > 0;
Result:
- rows_with_wins_gt_0: 0

4) Sum of wins across all rows
SQL:
SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.brian_watts;
Result:
- total_wins: 0

5) List tournaments with wins > 0
SQL:
SELECT tournament, wins FROM public.brian_watts WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY wins DESC, tournament;
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion:
- The data shows wins = 0 for every tournament listed. There are no tournaments with wins > 0. This supports the claim that none of the tournaments resulted in a win for Brian Watt(s).

Assumptions:
- “brian watt” refers to the golfer represented by the table public.brian_watts. The row labeled "totals" is a summary, not a tournament; including or excluding it does not change the finding (wins = 0).
