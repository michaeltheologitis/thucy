Claim interpreted: “The Dolphins won 9 of their final 10 games.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Available relevant table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (game-by-game results for the 1983 Miami Dolphins)

Evidence
1) Full season game list (ordered by week)
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week ASC;
Key rows (Weeks 7–16, i.e., the final 10 games):
- Week 7: result = w 32 - 14
- Week 8: result = w 21 - 7
- Week 9: result = w 30 - 14
- Week 10: result = w 20 - 17
- Week 11: result = l 17 - 6
- Week 12: result = w 37 - 0
- Week 13: result = w 38 - 14
- Week 14: result = w 24 - 17
- Week 15: result = w 31 - 24
- Week 16: result = w 34 - 14
This shows 9 wins and 1 loss over the final 10 games.

2) Direct computation of wins in the final 10 games
SQL executed:
SELECT week, result, date, opponent FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week DESC LIMIT 10;
(returns Weeks 16→7 with one loss at Week 11 and nine wins)

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lower(result) LIKE 'w%') AS wins, COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM (
  SELECT result
  FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  ORDER BY week DESC
  LIMIT 10
) AS last10;
Result: wins = 9, total_games = 10

3) Season coverage check
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result: {"game_count":16}

SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(week) AS min_week, MAX(week) AS max_week FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result: {"min_week":1, "max_week":16}

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT week) AS distinct_week_count, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE week IS NULL) AS null_week_count FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result: {"distinct_week_count":16, "null_week_count":0}

Conclusion
- The data for the 1983 Miami Dolphins shows they won 9 of their final 10 games. This directly supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions
- “Dolphins” refers to the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- Due to available data, the claim was evaluated for the 1983 season (the only season table accessible).
- “Final 10 games” refers to the last 10 listed by week (Weeks 7–16) in the regular season table.
- A “victory” is identified where the result field begins with 'w' (case-insensitive).
