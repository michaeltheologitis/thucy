Claim to verify: “the final episode have the second least view and air may 6.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact31)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.gary_unmarried (episode text, air date text, timeslot text, 18 - 49 text, viewers double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the final (latest) episode by air date
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "air date", viewers,
       to_date(initcap(replace("air date", ',', '')), 'Month DD YYYY') AS air_date_parsed
FROM public.gary_unmarried
ORDER BY air_date_parsed DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- episode = "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal", air date = may 20 , 2009, viewers = 5.55
Interpretation: The final episode by air date is “gary fixes allison’s garbage disposal,” aired May 20, 2009.

2) Rank episodes by viewers (ascending) to determine least/second-least
SQL executed:
SELECT
  episode,
  "air date",
  viewers,
  to_date(initcap(replace("air date", ',', '')), 'Month DD YYYY') AS air_date_parsed,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY viewers ASC) AS rank_asc,
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY viewers ASC) AS dense_rank
FROM public.gary_unmarried
ORDER BY viewers ASC NULLS LAST;
Key rows (lowest viewers):
- rank_asc=1: “gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal” — viewers=5.55 — air date=may 20 , 2009
- rank_asc=2: “gary meets the gang” — viewers=6.44 — air date=november 5 , 2008
- rank_asc=3: “gary and his half brother” — viewers=6.66 — air date=may 6 , 2009
Interpretation: The final episode has the lowest (not second lowest) viewership. The episode that aired on May 6, 2009 ranks third-lowest by viewers and is not the final episode.

3) Confirm the final episode’s viewer-rank explicitly
SQL executed:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT episode, viewers, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY viewers ASC) AS rank_asc
  FROM public.gary_unmarried
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE episode = 'gary fixes allison ''s garbage disposal';
Result:
- episode = “gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal”, viewers = 5.55, rank_asc = 1
Interpretation: The final episode is the single lowest-viewed episode.

4) Show the episode that aired on May 6 for completeness
(Already visible in ranking above, but included in the date-sorted list as well.)
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "air date", viewers,
       to_date(initcap(replace("air date", ' , ', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY') AS air_date_parsed
FROM public.gary_unmarried
ORDER BY air_date_parsed DESC;
Relevant row from result (newest → oldest):
- “gary and his half brother” — may 6 , 2009 — viewers=6.66 (appears before the final May 20 episode in chronological order)
Interpretation: May 6, 2009 corresponds to “gary and his half brother,” not the final episode.

Findings
- Air date claim: False. The final episode aired May 20, 2009, not May 6, 2009 (SQL 1).
- Viewership rank claim: False. The final episode had the least viewers, not the second least (SQL 2 and 3).

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data in public.gary_unmarried.

Assumptions made
- “Final episode” means the episode with the latest original air date in the gary_unmarried table.
- “View” refers to the numeric “viewers” measure in millions.
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the TV series represented by the available table (Gary Unmarried).
