Summary:
- Claim interpreted: For the 1983 season, the Air Force–Navy score is “TBD”.
- Evidence from the authoritative dataset shows the Air Force–Navy score for 1983 is 44 - 17, not TBD.

Data source explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
- Table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy
- Columns: season (bigint), trophy winner (text), air force - navy score (text), air force - army score (text), army - navy score (text)

Executed SQL and results:
1) Query to retrieve the specific score
SQL:
SELECT "air force - navy score" FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 1983;
Result:
{"air force - navy score": "44 - 17"}

2) Query to show the full 1983 record for context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 1983;
Result:
- season: 1983
- trophy winner: air force
- air force - navy score: 44 - 17
- air force - army score: 41 - 20
- army - navy score: 42 - 13

Conclusion:
- The data clearly indicates the Air Force–Navy score in the 1983 season was 44 - 17. Therefore, the claim that it is “TBD” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- “1983 season” refers to the row where season = 1983 in the commander_in_chief_s_trophy table.
- “Air Force - Navy score” corresponds to the column named exactly "air force - navy score" in that table.
- The provided dataset is authoritative and complete within its scope, per instructions.
