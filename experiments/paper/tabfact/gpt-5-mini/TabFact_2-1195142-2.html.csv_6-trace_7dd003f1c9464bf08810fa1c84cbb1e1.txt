Answer: No. In the available data, the 2005 Best Costume Design nominee did not win.

What I checked
- I first discovered the available data sources and found a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical table that records awards, categories, nominees, and results for the musical “La Cage aux Folles.”
- I queried all 2005 entries in this table where the category mentions “Costume” to see the nominee(s) and whether they won.

Evidence from the data
- The table shows two 2005 nominations related to costume design, both with result = "nominated" (i.e., not a win):
  - 2005 | tony award | best costume design | william ivey long | nominated
  - 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding costume design | william ivey long | nominated

Executed SQL (exact queries)
1) Listing 2005 costume-related entries:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND category ILIKE '%Costume%';

2) Confirmation (same filter to verify no winning result was present):
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE year = 2005
  AND category ILIKE '%costume%';

Conclusion
- There are no 2005 entries for costume-related categories with a winning result. Therefore, the proposition that the 2005 nominee for Best Costume Design won is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (awards for the musical “La Cage aux Folles”).
- Treated “Best Costume Design” as any category containing the word “Costume.”
- Interpreted year = 2005 as the year field in the table, which reflects the awards year for these entries.
