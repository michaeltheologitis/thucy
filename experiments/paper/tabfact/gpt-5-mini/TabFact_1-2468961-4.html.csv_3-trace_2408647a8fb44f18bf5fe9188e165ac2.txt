Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Howard Adler and Robert Griffard wrote the episode that originally aired on April 29, 1994. I searched authoritative data available to me and found a structured episode list for the TV series “Step by Step.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes (columns include: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, production code).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Identify the episode aired on April 29, 1994 and its writing credits.
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%April%' AND "original air date" ILIKE '%29%' AND "original air date" ILIKE '%1994%'
ORDER BY "no in series";
Result:
- no in series: 67
- no in season: 21
- title: the case of the missing diary
- written by: howard adler & robert griffard
- original air date: april 29 , 1994

2) Explicitly confirm both writers’ names appear for that date.
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%April 29%' AND "written by" ILIKE '%Howard Adler%' AND "written by" ILIKE '%Robert Griffard%';
Result:
- match_count: 1

Findings:
- The “Step by Step” episode that originally aired on April 29, 1994 is titled “the case of the missing diary.”
- Its “written by” credit is “howard adler & robert griffard,” confirming both writers.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the TV series “Step by Step,” as that is the relevant and available episode dataset with air dates and writer credits in the accessible data source.
