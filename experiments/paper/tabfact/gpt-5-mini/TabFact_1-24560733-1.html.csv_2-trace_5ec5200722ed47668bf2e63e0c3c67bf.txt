Claim interpreted: The (Kentucky) Wildcats lost 1 game in September and 2 games in November. Data source exploration found one relevant table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team in the TabFact database, which contains the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football schedule and results.

What the data shows:
- Losses identified in the table occur on these dates:
  • sept 20 — loss (vs. ole miss)
  • nov 1 — loss (vs. 18 alabama)
  • nov 22 — loss (vs. tennessee)
- This corresponds to 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) Inspect dates and results for all games
Query:
SELECT game, date, result FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team ORDER BY game;
Result (abridged to relevant fields):
[ {"game":1, "date":"sept 20", "result":"loss"},
  {"game":2, "date":"sept 27", "result":"win"},
  {"game":3, "date":"oct 4", "result":"win"},
  {"game":4, "date":"oct 11", "result":"win"},
  {"game":5, "date":"oct 18", "result":"win"},
  {"game":6, "date":"oct 25", "result":"win"},
  {"game":7, "date":"nov 1", "result":"loss"},
  {"game":8, "date":"nov 8", "result":"win"},
  {"game":9, "date":"nov 15", "result":"win"},
  {"game":10, "date":"nov 22", "result":"loss"} ]

2) Count losses in September
Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sept_losses FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'sept%' AND lower(result) = 'loss';
Result:
[{"sept_losses":1}]

3) Count losses in November
Query:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nov_losses FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'nov%' AND lower(result) = 'loss';
Result:
[{"nov_losses":2}]

Conclusion: The data confirms 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team.

Assumptions made:
- “the wildcat” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team represented in the available dataset (1947 season). If a different team/season was intended, results could differ.
- Month identification is based on the date text prefixes ('sept' for September, 'nov' for November) present in the dataset.
