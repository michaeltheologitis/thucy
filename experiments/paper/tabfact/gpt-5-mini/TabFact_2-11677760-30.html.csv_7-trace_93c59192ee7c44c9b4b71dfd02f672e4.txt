Claim interpreted: Whether a college in Kansas (specifically any college whose name contains “Kansas,” e.g., University of Kansas) has a player who attended St. Anthony High School.

Data discovery
- Available source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22) database
- Relevant table: public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
- Columns: player (text), height (text), school (text), hometown (text), college (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Direct check for any player whose high school mentions “St. Anthony” and whose college mentions “Kansas”
- Executed SQL (returned 0):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
  WHERE school ILIKE '%St. Anthony%'
    AND college ILIKE '%Kansas%';
  Result: match_count = 0

2) Broader matching for high school name variants (St., St, Saint; optional possessive)
- Executed SQL (returned 0):
  SELECT count(*) AS school_st_anthony_count
  FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
  WHERE school ~* '(^|[^A-Za-z0-9])(st\.?|saint)\s+anthony(''s)?([^A-Za-z0-9]|$)';
  Result: school_st_anthony_count = 0

3) Sanity check: confirm the dataset does have entries for colleges containing “Kansas”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, school, college
  FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
  WHERE college ILIKE '%Kansas%'
  ORDER BY player;
  Result rows:
  - perry ellis — wichita heights high school — kansas

Findings
- Within this dataset, there are no entries for any player whose high school matches variants of “St. Anthony.”
- The dataset does include at least one player who went to a college labeled “Kansas” (Perry Ellis), but his high school is Wichita Heights High School, not St. Anthony.
- Therefore, in the available data, there is no evidence that a player from St. Anthony High School attended a college with “Kansas” in its name.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative dataset, the claim that a Kansas college (e.g., University of Kansas) “got a player that attended St. Anthony High School” is not supported.

Assumptions
- “Kansas college” was interpreted as any college with the substring “Kansas” in the college column (e.g., University of Kansas, Kansas State). The queries used case-insensitive substring matching.
- “St. Anthony High School” was matched using several common variants: “St. Anthony,” “St Anthony,” and “Saint Anthony,” with an optional possessive and allowing for trailing descriptors like “High School.”
- Scope is limited to the USA Today All-USA High School Basketball Team dataset available in the connected database.
