What I checked
- I explored the available TabFact database and identified a relevant table: alex_bogdanovic, which includes columns for date, tournament, and surface.

Key evidence from the data
1) Inspection of sample rows (to understand date format and find the relevant entry):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", score FROM alex_bogdanovic LIMIT 50;
- Returned rows include:
  • date: 26 april 2004 | tournament: glasgow , great britain f1 | surface: carpet

2) Direct check of the surface for the specified date:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT surface FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE date = '26 april 2004';
- Result: surface = carpet

3) Context (tournament name on that date):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, tournament, surface FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE date = '26 april 2004';
- Result: date = 26 april 2004; tournament = glasgow , great britain f1; surface = carpet

Conclusion
- In the available data, the tournament that took place on 26 april 2004 is recorded with surface = carpet. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the tournament entry recorded for 26 april 2004 in the alex_bogdanovic table (TabFact database). The date is matched exactly as stored (lowercase month name).
