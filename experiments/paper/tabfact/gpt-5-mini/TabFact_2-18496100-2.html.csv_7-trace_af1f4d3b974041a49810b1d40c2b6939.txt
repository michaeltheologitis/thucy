Claim assessed: "gohad have 16732 more electorate in 2009 than bhander"

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency, with column "number of electorates (2009)"

Evidence retrieved
1) Enumerated constituency rows and 2009 electorates
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "name", "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency;
- Result excerpt:
  - gohad — 166893
  - bhander — 139600
  (Other rows present; a final "total :" row appears to be a sum and is not a constituency.)

2) Direct retrieval of the two constituencies
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower(name) IN ('gohad','bhander') ORDER BY lower(name);
- Results:
  - bhander — 139600
  - gohad — 166893

3) Computed the difference (gohad − bhander)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT (SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower(name)='gohad') - (SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower(name)='bhander') AS gohad_minus_bhander, abs((SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower(name)='gohad') - (SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower(name)='bhander')) AS absolute_difference;
- Result:
  - gohad_minus_bhander: 27293
  - absolute_difference: 27293

Analysis
- Gohad 2009 electorate: 166,893
- Bhander 2009 electorate: 139,600
- Difference (Gohad − Bhander): 166,893 − 139,600 = 27,293
- The claim states the difference is 16,732; this is not supported by the data. The actual difference is larger by 10,561.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the database evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "electorate in 2009" as the value in column "number of electorates (2009)" of table public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency.
- Matched constituency names case-insensitively and ignored the "total :" summary row, which is not a constituency.
