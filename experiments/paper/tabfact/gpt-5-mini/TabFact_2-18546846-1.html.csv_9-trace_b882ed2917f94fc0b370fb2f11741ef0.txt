Claim to verify: "the 49ers play the los angeles dones 1 time in the 1947 season"

Data source consulted: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema, table: t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season.

Step 1 — Retrieve the full 1947 schedule for grounding
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
ORDER BY week;

Result excerpt (relevant entries shown among full schedule):
- Week 2 — date: september 7 , 1947 — opponent: los angeles dons — result: w — score: 17 - 14 — record: 2 - 0
- Week 9 — date: november 2 , 1947 — opponent: los angeles dons — result: w — score: 26 - 16 — record: 6 - 2 - 1

Step 2 — Count how many times the opponent is Los Angeles Dons
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
WHERE opponent = 'los angeles dons';

Result: count = 2

Step 3 — List just the games vs. Los Angeles Dons for clarity
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Dons%';

Result:
- Week 2 — September 7, 1947 — Result: W — Score: 17 - 14
- Week 9 — November 2, 1947 — Result: W — Score: 26 - 16

Conclusion: The data shows the San Francisco 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons twice in the 1947 season, not once.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "los angeles dones" as a misspelling of "Los Angeles Dons" (AAFC team). The opponent field in the data is lowercase "los angeles dons"; queries included exact and case-insensitive matches to confirm counts and listings.
