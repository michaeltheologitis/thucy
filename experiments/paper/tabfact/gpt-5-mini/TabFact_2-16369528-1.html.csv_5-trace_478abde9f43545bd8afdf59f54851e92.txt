Claim (interpreted): After 2005, the only Lifetime Achievement winners in the Ned Kelly Awards during years when both Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote were listed as 'na' were Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day.

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: ned_kelly_awards
  - Columns: year; best teenage / young adult; reader 's vote; best non - fiction; lifetime achievement

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Inspect rows after 2005 including the relevant columns.
SQL:
SELECT "year", "best non - fiction", "reader 's vote", "lifetime achievement"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "year" > 2005
ORDER BY "year";
Result:
- 2006 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: andrew rule and john silvester
- 2007 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: sandra harvey and lindsay simpson
- 2008 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: marele day
- 2009 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: shane maloney
- 2010 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: peter doyle
- 2011 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: na

2) Directly list Lifetime Achievement winners where both Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote are 'na' and year > 2005.
SQL:
SELECT year, "lifetime achievement"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE (year)::integer > 2005
  AND "best non - fiction" = 'na'
  AND "reader 's vote" = 'na'
ORDER BY (year)::integer;
Result:
- 2006 — andrew rule and john silvester
- 2007 — sandra harvey and lindsay simpson
- 2008 — marele day
- 2009 — shane maloney
- 2010 — peter doyle
- 2011 — na

Assessment:
- The named individuals (Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day) do appear as Lifetime Achievement recipients after 2005 in years where Best Non-Fiction and Reader's Vote are 'na'.
- However, they are not the only such recipients. The data clearly shows additional Lifetime Achievement winners under the same conditions: Shane Maloney (2009) and Peter Doyle (2010).
- Therefore, the exclusivity claim is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim that only Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day meet these conditions is incorrect.

Assumptions and clarifications:
- 'na' in the table denotes that no winner/award was recorded for that category in that year.
- "After the year 2005" is interpreted as strictly greater than 2005 (i.e., 2006 onward).
- Spelling was normalized based on the database (e.g., 'john silvester' vs. user 'john silverster').
