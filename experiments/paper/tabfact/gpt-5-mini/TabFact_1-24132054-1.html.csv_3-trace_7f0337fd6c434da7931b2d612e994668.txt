Summary
- Claim: “the tv series dexter have 11 episode in its third season.”
- Data source discovered: a single PostgreSQL dataset with a table named public.dexter_season_3.
- Finding: The table contains 10 rows (episodes) with the highest listed episode number being 11; episode number 9 is missing from the data. The dataset does not provide evidence that there are 11 episodes.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: A public schema containing one dataset named "dexter_season_3".

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result (key details): Table public.dexter_season_3 with columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text). No keys or FKs.

Evidence 1: Count episodes and check max episode number
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count, MAX("no in season") AS max_no_in_season FROM public.dexter_season_3;
- Result:
  - episode_count = 10
  - max_no_in_season = 11

Evidence 2: List episodes by in-season number
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title FROM public.dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season";
- Result (episode number — title):
  1 — our father
  2 — finding freebo
  3 — the lion sleeps tonight
  4 — all in the family
  5 — turning biminese
  6 — sãí se puede
  7 — easy as pie
  8 — the damage a man can do
  10 — go your own way
  11 — i had a dream
- Note: No row with "no in season" = 9 returned by the dataset.

Conclusion
- The accessible, authoritative dataset lists only 10 episodes for Dexter’s third season. Although the maximum in-season number is 11, the data does not include an 11th distinct episode entry (episode number 9 is missing). Therefore, the claim that season 3 has 11 episodes is not supported by the evidence available here.

Assumptions
- Each row in public.dexter_season_3 corresponds to one episode of Dexter season 3.
- The dataset is complete within its scope, and the column "no in season" correctly reflects episode numbering.
