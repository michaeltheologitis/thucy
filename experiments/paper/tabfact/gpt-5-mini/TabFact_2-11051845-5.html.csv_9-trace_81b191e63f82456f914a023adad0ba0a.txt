Claim to verify: “spiral galaxy have the second highest declination ( j2000 ) in the list.”

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21), schema public, with one table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.

Step 2 — Inspect schema
Tool: schema_query
Answer summary: The table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 has columns:
- ngc number (bigint)
- object type (text)
- constellation (text)
- right ascension ( j2000 ) (text)
- declination ( j2000 ) (text)
- apparent magnitude (double precision)

Step 3 — Retrieve rows to examine declination (J2000) values and object types
Tool: nl_query_traceable
Executed SQL 1:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000;
Result: count = 5

Executed SQL 2:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "right ascension ( j2000 )", "declination ( j2000 )" FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 LIMIT 10;
Results (all 5 rows):
- ngc number: 5408; object type: irregular galaxy; right ascension ( j2000 ): 14h03 m21.0s; declination ( j2000 ):  degree22′44″
- ngc number: 5457; object type: spiral galaxy; right ascension ( j2000 ): 14h03 m12.5s; declination ( j2000 ):  degree20′53″
- ngc number: 5466; object type: globular cluster; right ascension ( j2000 ): 14h05 m27.4s; declination ( j2000 ):  degree32′04″
- ngc number: 5474; object type: spiral galaxy; right ascension ( j2000 ): 14h05 m01.5s; declination ( j2000 ):  degree39′45″
- ngc number: 5477; object type: irregular galaxy; right ascension ( j2000 ): 14h05 m33.1s; declination ( j2000 ):  degree27′40″

Executed SQL 3 (to view constellation and exact declination strings):
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "constellation", "declination ( j2000 )"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
ORDER BY "ngc number";
Results:
- 5408 | irregular galaxy | centaurus   |  degree22′44″
- 5457 | spiral galaxy    | ursa major  |  degree20′53″
- 5466 | globular cluster | boötes      |  degree32′04″
- 5474 | spiral galaxy    | ursa major  |  degree39′45″
- 5477 | irregular galaxy | ursa major  |  degree27′40″

Executed SQL 4 (to confirm raw storage of declination text):
SELECT "ngc number", "declination ( j2000 )", length("declination ( j2000 )") AS decl_len
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
ORDER BY "ngc number";
Results:
- 5408 | " degree22′44″" | 13
- 5457 | " degree20′53″" | 13
- 5466 | " degree32′04″" | 13
- 5474 | " degree39′45″" | 13
- 5477 | " degree27′40″" | 13

Findings from the data
- The column “declination ( j2000 )” is stored as text and, in this dataset, each value is missing the degree magnitude and sign. Every value begins with a space followed by the literal word “degree”, then shows only minutes and seconds (e.g., “ degree20′53″”).
- Because the degree component (and sign) are absent, it is not possible to compute or rank actual declinations from this column. Any determination of which entry has the highest or second-highest declination would require the missing degree values and sign.
- Therefore, based strictly on the accessible data, we cannot verify whether a spiral galaxy has the second highest declination in this list.

Conclusion
- The claim is unsupported by the available evidence, because the key field needed to evaluate it (complete declination values with degrees and sign) is incomplete in the dataset.

Assumptions made
- “the list” refers to the only accessible table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.
- The intended interpretation of the claim is that, among all rows in this table, the entry with the second highest declination (J2000) is of type “spiral galaxy.” Given the incomplete declination data, this cannot be verified from the dataset.
