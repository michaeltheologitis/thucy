Summary of findings:
- The data source contains a table of men’s team lineups for the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials with columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city.
- A search shows a single relevant row where Brendan Melnyk appears as lead. In that row, Ted Appelman is listed as the skip, and Tom Appelman is listed as the third / vice skip.
- Therefore, the statement “brendan melnyk be lead and ted appelman be third / vice skip” is partly incorrect: Brendan Melnyk is indeed the lead, but Ted Appelman is not the third / vice skip; he is the skip. The third / vice skip is Tom Appelman.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Verified table structure
- SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials';
- Result:
  - skip (text)
  - third / vice skip (text)
  - second (text)
  - lead (text)
  - city (text)

2) Targeted retrieval by lead name (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
SELECT "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead", "city"
FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE lead ILIKE 'Brendan Melnyk';
- Result:
  - skip: ted appelman
  - third / vice skip: tom appelman
  - second: bradon klassen
  - lead: brendan melnyk
  - city: edmonton

3) Broad search for any Appelman or Melnyk in the lineup (confirmation)
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Melnyk%'
   OR "skip" ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR "skip" ILIKE '%Melnyk%'
   OR "second" ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR "second" ILIKE '%Melnyk%'
   OR "lead" ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR "lead" ILIKE '%Melnyk%';
- Result (single row):
  - city: edmonton; lead: brendan melnyk; second: bradon klassen; skip: ted appelman; third / vice skip: tom appelman

Conclusion:
- Correct: Brendan Melnyk is the lead.
- Incorrect: Ted Appelman is not the third / vice skip; he is the skip. The third / vice skip is Tom Appelman.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the lineups represented in the available table t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials.
- Name matching is performed case-insensitively but otherwise exact as stored in the dataset.
- Positions correspond to the column headers in the table (skip, third / vice skip, second, lead).
