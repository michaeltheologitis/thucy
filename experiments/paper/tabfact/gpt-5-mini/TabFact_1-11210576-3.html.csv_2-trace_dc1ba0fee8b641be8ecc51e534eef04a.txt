Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the duration for Max Martini is “02x03 - 03x05” (season-episode range). I verified this against the available data.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: postgres_tabfact23 (public schema)
- Table: list_of_csi_miami_characters (columns include character, actor, first episode, final episode, duration, final episode count)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate Max Martini and inspect recorded duration
SQL:
SELECT character, actor, "first episode", "final episode", duration, "final episode count"
FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters
WHERE actor ILIKE '%max%martini%';

Result:
- character: bob keaton
  actor: max martini
  first episode: big brother
  final episode: vengeance
  duration: 02x08 , 03x20 - 03x22
  final episode count: 3

2) Check explicitly for a Max Martini row whose duration contains both 02x03 and 03x05
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters
WHERE actor ILIKE 'max martini'
  AND duration LIKE '%02x03%'
  AND duration LIKE '%03x05%';

Result:
- match_count: 0

Conclusion: The data lists Max Martini’s duration as “02x08 , 03x20 - 03x22,” not “02x03 - 03x05.” There are no rows for Max Martini whose duration includes both 02x03 and 03x05.

Assumptions:
- Duration refers to the appearance range string stored in the duration column, using season x episode notation.
- Actor name matched case-insensitively as “max martini.”
