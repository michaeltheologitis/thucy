Claim: “there be 4 test match in the last 2 month of 1978.”

Conclusion: Supported by the available data. The 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour dataset shows exactly 4 Test matches in November and December 1978.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):

1) List all Test-match rows and their dates
SQL:
SELECT date, status FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE status ILIKE '%Test%';
Result:
- 4 november 1978 | test match
- 11 november 1978 | test match
- 25 november 1978 | test match
- 9 december 1978 | test match

2) Count total Test matches
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_test_matches FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE status ILIKE '%Test%';
Result:
- total_test_matches = 4

3) Count Test matches by month (to confirm they’re in the last two months of 1978)
SQL:
SELECT split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS month, COUNT(*) AS matches_count
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE status ILIKE '%Test%'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
Result:
- december | 1
- november | 3

Interpretation
- The dataset records four Test matches with dates in November (three) and December (one) 1978, which are the last two months of the year. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Last 2 month of 1978” is interpreted as November and December 1978.
- Rows whose status contains “Test” (case-insensitive) are treated as Test matches.
- The date column is text formatted like “4 november 1978”; month parsed as the middle token.
