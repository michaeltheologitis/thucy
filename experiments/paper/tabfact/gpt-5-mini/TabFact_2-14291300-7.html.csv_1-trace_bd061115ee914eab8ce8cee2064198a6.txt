Summary
- Interpreted claim: On March 13, the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs and the points total was 63.

Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table: public.my_info_table.
- Schema details of public.my_info_table: columns = game (bigint), march (bigint), opponent (text), score (text), record (text), points (bigint).

Evidence
1) Schema check
Executed SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'my_info_table';
(Note: Retrieved via the schema tool, summarized above.)

2) Row(s) for March 13
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, march, opponent, score, record, points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE march = 13;

Result:
- game: 68 | march: 13 | opponent: toronto maple leafs | score: 3 - 2 | record: 25 - 30 - 13 | points: 63

Assessment
- The table shows that on march = 13, the opponent is "toronto maple leafs" and points = 63. This directly supports the claim that during March 13, the Toronto Maple Leafs were the opponent with 63 points.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data returned from public.my_info_table.

Assumptions
- “During march 13” maps to the row where the column march equals 13 in public.my_info_table.
- “Point” refers to the value in the points column of the same row.
- Spelling/capitalization differences (e.g., "toronto maple leafs") are treated as equivalent to “Toronto Maple Leafs.”
