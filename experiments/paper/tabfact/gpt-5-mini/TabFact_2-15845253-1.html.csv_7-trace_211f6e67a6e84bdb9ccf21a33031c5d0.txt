Summary
- Interpreted claim: The dataset indicates that 8 viral entries are non-enveloped.
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (schema public) containing the table public.viral_disease.

Schema inspection
- Table: public.viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)
  - The envelopment column records whether viruses are enveloped or non-enveloped.

Evidence
1) Distinct envelopment values and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT envelopment, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY envelopment
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST;
Result:
- envelopment = "enveloped": 15 rows
- envelopment = "non - enveloped": 8 rows

2) Total rows for context
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.viral_disease;
Result:
- total_rows = 23

3) Listing the non-enveloped families (to validate the count and categories)
Executed SQL:
SELECT family, envelopment FROM public.viral_disease WHERE lower(envelopment) LIKE '%non%envel%' OR lower(envelopment) LIKE '%naked%' ORDER BY family;
Result (8 rows):
- adenoviridae — non - enveloped
- astroviridae — non - enveloped
- caliciviridae — non - enveloped
- papillomaviridae — non - enveloped
- parvoviridae — non - enveloped
- picornaviridae — non - enveloped
- polyomaviridae — non - enveloped
- reoviridae — non - enveloped

Analysis
- The envelopment field explicitly categorizes entries. The grouped counts show exactly 8 rows labeled “non - enveloped.”
- The detailed listing confirms exactly 8 families are marked non-enveloped.

Conclusion
- The claim that 8 of the viral entries are non-enveloped aligns with the database evidence.

Assumptions
- I interpret “viral disease” in the claim as referring to the records in public.viral_disease, where each row represents a virus family with associated properties, including envelope status.
- I treated the envelopment value "non - enveloped" as definitive for non-enveloped status.
