Claim: “steve gould be the lead in the city of winnipeg and the third / vice skip be kevin park.”

Data source consulted: postgres_tabfact3.public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials (trusted source per instructions)

Step 1: Retrieve all entries for Winnipeg to inspect relevant rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead", "city" 
FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE city ILIKE '%Winnipeg%';

Results:
1) skip: kerry burtnyk; third / vice skip: don walchuk; second: richard daneault; lead: garth smith; city: winnipeg
2) skip: jeff stoughton; third / vice skip: kevin park; second: rob fowler; lead: steve gould; city: winnipeg
3) skip: mike mcewen; third / vice skip: b j neufeld; second: matt wozniak; lead: denni neufeld; city: winnipeg

Observation: There is a Winnipeg row where the lead is Steve Gould and the third / vice skip is Kevin Park (row 2).

Step 2: Directly verify the specific combination
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE lower(city) = 'winnipeg'
  AND lower(lead) = 'steve gould'
  AND lower("third / vice skip") = 'kevin park';

Result: count = 1

Conclusion: The dataset contains a Winnipeg team entry with Steve Gould as lead and Kevin Park as third/vice skip, confirming the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “City of Winnipeg” refers to the “city” column value “winnipeg” in this dataset (2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials).
- Matching was performed case-insensitively for names and city.
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of this dataset and time frame.
