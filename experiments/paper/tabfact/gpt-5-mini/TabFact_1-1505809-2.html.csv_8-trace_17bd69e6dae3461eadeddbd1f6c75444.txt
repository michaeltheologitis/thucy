Claim interpreted: “46 is the value of ends lost when blank ends is 9.” Interpreted within the available TabFact database table public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier, where the columns include “ends lost” and “blank ends.”

Data source discovery:
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public, table: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier, with relevant columns: “ends lost” (bigint) and “blank ends” (bigint).

Evidence 1: Check rows where blank ends = 9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT locale, skip, "blank ends", "ends lost" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 9;
- Result:
  • locale: northern ontario; skip: mike jakubo; blank ends: 9; ends lost: 48
- Interpretation: The only row with blank ends = 9 has ends lost = 48 (not 46).

Evidence 2: Check if any row has ends lost = 46 and what its blank ends value is
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT locale, skip, "blank ends" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "ends lost" = 46;
- Result:
  • locale: ontario; skip: wayne middaugh; blank ends: 10
- Interpretation: A row with ends lost = 46 exists, but its blank ends value is 10, not 9.

Assessment:
- The dataset shows that when blank ends = 9, ends lost = 48 (not 46). Conversely, ends lost = 46 occurs when blank ends = 10. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Mapped “end lost” to the column “ends lost” and “blank end” to “blank ends.”
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the TabFact public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier dataset, the only accessible source containing these fields.
