Claim interpreted: “19 - 9 - 4 be the record of the match that have a time of 1:44 in Saitama, Japan.” I check whether there exists a fight in Saitama, Japan with a recorded time of 1:44, and whether the associated record is 19 - 9 - 4.

Findings:
- In the katsuya_inoue table, there are entries for Saitama, Japan, but none with time 1:44.
- There is exactly one fight with time 1:44 in this table; it took place in Tokyo, Japan, and the record listed is 19 - 9 - 4.

Executed SQL and results (shown exactly as run):
1) List all fights located in Saitama:
SQL: SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE location ILIKE '%Saitama%';
Results:
- {res: "draw", record: "18 - 6 - 4", opponent: "mizuto hirota", method: "draw", event: "gcm - cage force ex", round: 3, time: "5:00", location: "saitama , japan"}
- {res: "loss", record: "16 - 6 - 3", opponent: "nick diaz", method: "tko (corner stoppage)", event: "dream3", round: 1, time: "6:45", location: "saitama , japan"}

2) Check for any Saitama fight with exact time 1:44:
SQL: SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE location ILIKE '%Saitama%' AND time = '1:44';
Result: no rows returned

3) Check for any Saitama fight with a time containing 1:44:
SQL: SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE location ILIKE '%Saitama%' AND time LIKE '%1:44%';
Result: no rows returned

4) Find any fight with time 1:44 (any location):
SQL: SELECT res, record, opponent, event, round, time, location
FROM public.katsuya_inoue
WHERE time = '1:44' OR time LIKE '%1:44%';
Result (1 row):
- res: loss; record: 19 - 9 - 4; opponent: naoyuki kotani; event: pancrase - impressive tour 9; round: 1; time: 1:44; location: tokyo , japan

Conclusion:
- There is no fight in Saitama, Japan with a time of 1:44 in this dataset. The only fight with time 1:44 has record 19 - 9 - 4 but took place in Tokyo, Japan. Therefore, the claim tying 1:44 to Saitama is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The katsuya_inoue table represents the professional fight record of the fighter Katsuya Inoue, with “record” indicating the fighter’s cumulative record at the time of that bout.
- “Time” refers to the bout end time within the specified round.
- “Saitama, Japan” is matched case-insensitively via ILIKE '%Saitama%' to account for formatting variations in the location field.
