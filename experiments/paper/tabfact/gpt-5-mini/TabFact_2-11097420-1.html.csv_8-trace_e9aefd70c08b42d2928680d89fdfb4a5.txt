Claim to verify: “potter co in copiah be the first project propose, but the last to be list.”

Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted domain: Superfund (NPL) sites in Mississippi.
- “potter co in copiah” refers to the Superfund site “Potter Co” located in Copiah County, MS.
- “first project propose” interpreted as: among Mississippi Superfund sites, Potter Co had the earliest NPL proposed date.
- “last to be list” interpreted as: among Mississippi Superfund sites, Potter Co had the latest final NPL listing date.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
- Relevant columns: name (text), county (text), proposed (text), listed (text), plus other date-like fields.
- Schema details confirmed via schema inspection.

Evidence gathered
1) Locate Potter Co in Copiah County and inspect dates
SQL executed:
SELECT name, county, proposed, listed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE name ILIKE '%potter%' AND county ILIKE '%copiah%';
Result:
- name: potter co; county: copiah; proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993; listed: -
Key points:
- Potter Co exists in Copiah County.
- Proposed date recorded: 05/10/1993.
- Listed date is “-” (no final NPL listing date recorded).

2) Earliest proposed date among all MS sites
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(to_date(proposed, 'MM / DD / YYYY')) AS earliest_proposed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE proposed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$';
Result:
- earliest_proposed = 1983-09-08

SQL executed:
SELECT "cerclis id", name, county, proposed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE proposed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$' AND to_date(proposed,'MM / DD / YYYY') = (SELECT MIN(to_date(proposed,'MM / DD / YYYY')) FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE proposed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$');
Result:
- cerclis id: msd980710941; name: flowood site; county: rankin; proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983
Key point:
- The earliest proposed date in the dataset is 09/08/1983 for Flowood Site (Rankin County), not Potter Co (which is 05/10/1993). Thus, Potter Co was not the first proposed.

3) Latest listed date among all MS sites
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(to_date(listed, 'MM / DD / YYYY')) AS latest_listed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE listed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$';
Result:
- latest_listed = 2007-03-07

SQL executed:
SELECT "cerclis id", name, county, listed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE listed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$' AND to_date(listed,'MM / DD / YYYY') = (SELECT MAX(to_date(listed,'MM / DD / YYYY')) FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE listed ~ '^[0-9]{2} / [0-9]{2} / [0-9]{4}$');
Result:
- cerclis id: msd086556388; name: sonford products; county: rankin; listed: 03 / 07 / 2007
Key point:
- The latest listed site is Sonford Products (Rankin County) on 03/07/2007. Potter Co has no listed date (“-”), so it cannot be the last listed.

4) Check all sites in Copiah County
SQL executed:
SELECT "name", "county", "proposed", "listed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE county ILIKE '%Copiah%';
Result:
- Potter Co — county: copiah — proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993 — listed: -
Key point:
- Potter Co appears to be the only Copiah County entry and lacks a listed date.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data.
  - Potter Co (Copiah) was not the first proposed among Mississippi sites (earliest is 09/08/1983 for Flowood Site; Potter Co proposed on 05/10/1993).
  - Potter Co is not the last listed; in fact, it has no listed date in the dataset, while the latest listed site is Sonford Products (03/07/2007).

Assumptions made
- “Project” refers to Superfund NPL sites.
- “Proposed” is the NPL proposed date; “listed” is the NPL final listing date.
- “Last to be list” means the most recent final listing date among Mississippi sites.
- A dash “-” in date fields indicates no date (not proposed/listed/completed as applicable).
