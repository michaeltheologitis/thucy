Claim to verify: "In the Illinois 6th district, Republican Henry Hyde, incumbent since 1974, beat Democrat Mario Reymond Reda."

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact23
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 (columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Locate the Illinois 6th district entry (case-insensitive search):
SQL:
SELECT district FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 WHERE district ILIKE '%Illinois%' AND district ILIKE '%6%';
Result:
[{"district":"illinois 6"}]

2) Inspect column names to handle the space in "first elected":
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result:
[{"column_name":"district","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"incumbent","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"party","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"first elected","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"result","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"candidates","data_type":"text"}]

3) Retrieve the full record for Illinois 6th district:
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 WHERE district = 'illinois 6';
Result:
[{"district":"illinois 6","incumbent":"henry hyde","party":"republican","first elected":1974,"result":"re - elected","candidates":"henry hyde (r) 67.0% mario reymond reda (d) 33.0%"}]

Assessment:
- District: Illinois 6 — matches claim.
- Incumbent: Henry Hyde — matches claim.
- Party: Republican — matches claim.
- First elected: 1974 — supports "incumbent since 1974."
- Result and opponents: The candidates field explicitly shows Henry Hyde defeating Mario Reymond Reda (D), with Hyde receiving 67.0% and Reda 33.0% — matches claim.

Conclusion: The data directly supports that in the Illinois 6th congressional district (1980 election), Republican incumbent Henry Hyde, first elected in 1974, defeated Democrat Mario Reymond Reda.

Assumptions:
- The claim did not specify a year. I interpreted it as referring to the 1980 U.S. House election, as per the available table united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980. The evidence is specific to that year.
