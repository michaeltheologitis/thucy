Claim to verify: “6.2 be the total of rebound average with more than 124 game and a rank of 10.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: rank (bigint), player (text), years (text), games (bigint), "reb avg" (double precision), "total rebounds" (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check whether any row exists with rank = 10 and games > 124
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE rank = 10 AND games > 124;
- Result:
  count = 0
- Interpretation: No rows satisfy rank = 10 AND games > 124.

2) Compute the sum ("total") of rebound average for rows with rank = 10 and games > 124
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM("reb avg") AS sum_reb_avg FROM public.my_info_table WHERE rank = 10 AND games > 124;
- Result:
  sum_reb_avg = NULL (no matching rows)
- Interpretation: Since there are zero matching rows, the sum is NULL (not 6.2).

3) Inspect the row(s) with rank = 10 to see the actual games and rebound average values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE rank = 10;
- Result:
  player: jesse young; years: 1999 - 2003; games: 115; reb avg: 6.2; total rebounds: 708
- Interpretation: The rank-10 player’s rebound average is 6.2, but he has 115 games, which is not more than 124.

Conclusion
- There are no rows with rank = 10 and games > 124; therefore, the “total of rebound average” over that set is not 6.2 (it’s NULL due to no records).
- While the rank-10 player’s rebound average is indeed 6.2, he does not meet the “more than 124 games” condition (he has 115 games). Thus, the claim as stated is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “rebound average” refers to the column named "reb avg" in public.my_info_table.
- “more than 124 game” is interpreted as games > 124.
- “rank of 10” refers to the column rank = 10.
- “total of rebound average” is interpreted as SUM("reb avg") over rows matching the filters.
