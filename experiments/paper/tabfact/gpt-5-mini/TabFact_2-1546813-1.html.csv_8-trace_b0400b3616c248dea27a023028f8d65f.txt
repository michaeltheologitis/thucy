Claim to verify: “the Solheim Cup be host in the United States 6 time from 1990–2013.”

Data source discovery:
- Found database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact27), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.solheim_cup (columns: year, venue, winning team, score, usa captain, europe captain).

Step 1 — List all editions (1990–2013) and venues
SQL executed:
SELECT year, venue FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1990 — lake nona golf & country club, Florida, USA
- 1992 — dalmahoy country club, Scotland
- 1994 — the greenbrier, West Virginia, USA
- 1996 — st pierre golf & country club, Wales
- 1998 — muirfield village, Ohio, USA
- 2000 — loch lomond golf club, Scotland
- 2002 — interlachen country club, Minnesota, USA
- 2003 — barsebäck golf & country club, Sweden
- 2005 — crooked stick golf club, Indiana, USA
- 2007 — halmstad gk, Sweden
- 2009 — rich harvest farms, Illinois, USA
- 2011 — killeen castle golf resort, Ireland
- 2013 — colorado golf club, Colorado, USA

Step 2 — Count U.S.-hosted editions in that range
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS usa_count FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND venue ILIKE '%usa%';
Result:
- usa_count = 7

Step 3 — List U.S.-hosted editions for confirmation
SQL executed:
SELECT year, venue FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND venue ILIKE '%usa%' ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1990 — lake nona golf & country club, florida, usa
- 1994 — the greenbrier, west virginia, usa
- 1998 — muirfield village, ohio, usa
- 2002 — interlachen country club, minnesota, usa
- 2005 — crooked stick golf club, indiana, usa
- 2009 — rich harvest farms, illinois, usa
- 2013 — colorado golf club, colorado, usa

Conclusion:
- Between 1990 and 2013 inclusive, the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States 7 times, not 6. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The year range 1990–2013 is inclusive.
- A venue string containing “usa” indicates a U.S. host location (consistent with the venue formatting in the dataset).
