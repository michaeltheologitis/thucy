Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: There exists a record where nat = MKD and the name is (contains) Nikolovski.
- Data source explored: PostgreSQL instance “TabFact” (public schema). Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season, which includes columns nat (text) and name (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Main search for either nat = 'MKD' or name containing 'Nikolovski'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'MKD' OR name ILIKE '%Nikolovski%';
Result (1 row):
- moving to: aep paphos
- name: nikolovski
- nat: mkd
- source: -
- transfer fee: free
- transfer window: winter
- type: mutual consent

2) Exact case-sensitive check for nat = 'MKD'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'MKD';
Result: no rows.

3) Case-insensitive check for nat matching 'MKD'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat ILIKE 'MKD';
Result (1 row, same as above):
- moving to: aep paphos
- name: nikolovski
- nat: mkd
- source: -
- transfer fee: free
- transfer window: winter
- type: mutual consent

4) Direct verification that both conditions hold together (nat = MKD case-insensitive AND name contains Nikolovski case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat ILIKE 'MKD' AND name ILIKE '%Nikolovski%';
Result (1 row):
- moving to: aep paphos
- name: nikolovski
- nat: mkd
- source: -
- transfer fee: free
- transfer window: winter
- type: mutual consent

Conclusion
- The table contains a record with nat stored as 'mkd' and name 'nikolovski'. Interpreting MKD case-insensitively and “have the name Nikolovski” as a case-insensitive name match, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the nat mkd have the name nikolovski” as: There exists a row where nat equals MKD (case-insensitive) and name contains/equals Nikolovski (case-insensitive).
