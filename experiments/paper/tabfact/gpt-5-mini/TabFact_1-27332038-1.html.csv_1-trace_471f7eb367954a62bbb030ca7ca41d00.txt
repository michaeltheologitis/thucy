Summary
- Claim: “the episode with the production code of 2ARG01 be originally air on october 6 , 2010.”
- Finding: Supported by the Modern Family Season 2 dataset. The episode with production code 2ARG01 is “Earthquake,” and its original air date is recorded as “october 6 , 2010.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: modern_family_season_2
  - Columns: "no in series", "no in season", "title", "directed by", "written by", "original air date", "production code", "us viewers (millions)"

Executed SQL evidence
1) Survey production codes to confirm presence and casing
SQL:
SELECT "production code", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.modern_family_season_2 GROUP BY "production code" ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result (excerpt):
[{"production code":"2arg02","cnt":1}, …, {"production code":"2arg01","cnt":1}, …]

2) Retrieve the episode details for production code 2ARG01 (case-insensitive match)
SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "original air date", "production code"
FROM public.modern_family_season_2
WHERE lower("production code") = lower('2ARG01');
Result:
[{"title":"earthquake","no in season":3,"original air date":"october 6 , 2010","production code":"2arg01"}]

Conclusion
- The data shows that production code 2ARG01 corresponds to the episode “Earthquake” (Season 2, Episode 3) with an original air date of “october 6 , 2010.” The claim is supported.

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive comparison was applied because the stored code is lowercase ("2arg01") while the claim uses uppercase ("2ARG01").
- The dataset refers to Modern Family Season 2, consistent with the table name and schema description.
