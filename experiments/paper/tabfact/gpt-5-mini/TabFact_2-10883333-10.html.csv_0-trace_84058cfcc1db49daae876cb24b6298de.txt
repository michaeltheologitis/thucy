Claim interpreted: The Princes Park venue has more crowd (attendance) than the Junction Oval venue.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact6 (TabFact). Relevant table: public.t_1975_vfl_season with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.

Step 1 — Identify venue name variants in the data
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "venue" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "venue" ILIKE '%Prince%' OR "venue" ILIKE '%Junction%' ORDER BY "venue";
Result:
- junction oval
- princes park

Step 2 — Compare attendance (matches, total crowd, average crowd) by venue
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches, SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS avg_crowd
FROM t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE venue IN ('princes park','junction oval')
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY venue;
Result:
- junction oval — matches: 1, total_crowd: 16249, avg_crowd: 16249.0
- princes park — matches: 1, total_crowd: 23830, avg_crowd: 23830.0

Robustness check (case-insensitive normalization)
Executed SQL:
SELECT LOWER(venue) AS venue_norm,
       COUNT(*) AS matches,
       SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd,
       AVG(crowd) AS avg_crowd
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE LOWER(venue) IN ('princes park', 'junction oval')
GROUP BY LOWER(venue)
ORDER BY venue_norm;
Result:
- junction oval — matches: 1, total_crowd: 16249, avg_crowd: 16249.0
- princes park — matches: 1, total_crowd: 23830, avg_crowd: 23830.0

Conclusion:
Within the available 1975 VFL season data, Princes Park had a higher recorded crowd than Junction Oval (23,830 vs 16,249). This holds for total and average because each venue appears once in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- "prince park" refers to "princes park"; "menu" was interpreted as "venue".
- The claim is evaluated against the available dataset (public.t_1975_vfl_season), which covers the 1975 VFL season. No other seasons or datasets were available in the connected sources.
