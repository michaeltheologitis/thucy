Claim to verify: "in 1962, the Victorian Football League season take place on 23 June"

Summary of findings:
- The TabFact database contains a table named public.t_1962_vfl_season with match records for the 1962 VFL season.
- Querying this table shows six matches recorded on the date "23 june 1962". This confirms that the 1962 VFL season had fixtures on 23 June 1962.

Evidence (executed SQL and key results):
1) List all distinct dates present in the 1962 VFL season table
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season ORDER BY "date";
Result:
- 23 june 1962

2) Retrieve all rows where the date includes "23 June"
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE "date" ILIKE '%23 June%';
Results (home team | home team score | away team | away team score | venue | crowd | date):
- melbourne | 11.18 (84) | st kilda | 11.6 (72) | mcg | 48952 | 23 june 1962
- essendon | 15.17 (107) | geelong | 10.7 (67) | windy hill | 35000 | 23 june 1962
- collingwood | 10.14 (74) | fitzroy | 9.11 (65) | victoria park | 26488 | 23 june 1962
- carlton | 12.9 (81) | footscray | 9.10 (64) | princes park | 32400 | 23 june 1962

- north melbourne | 10.8 (68) | hawthorn | 10.7 (67) | arden street oval | 8470 | 23 june 1962

3) Confirm the number of matches recorded on each date
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 200;
Result:
[{"date":"23 june 1962"}]

SQL executed:
SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS matches FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date":"23 june 1962","matches":6}]

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Result:
[{"total_matches":6}]

Conclusion:
- The data shows that on 23 June 1962, six VFL matches were played, confirming that the 1962 VFL season had games on that date.

Assumptions made:
- I interpreted the claim to mean that matches from the 1962 VFL season occurred on 23 June 1962. If the claim intended that the entire season took place on that single day, the data does not support that interpretation; it only confirms fixtures on that date.
