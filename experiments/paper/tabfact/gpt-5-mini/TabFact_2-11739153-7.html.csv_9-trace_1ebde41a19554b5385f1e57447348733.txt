What was checked
- Interpreted the claim as: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision column lists Harding more times than Backstrom (i.e., Josh Harding was the goaltender of record more often than Niklas Backstrom in the game log).

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season.
- Inspected the schema of t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season to understand relevant columns, especially decision (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count occurrences of each value in decision:
SQL executed:
SELECT decision, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season GROUP BY decision ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
[{"cnt":11, "decision":"backstrom"}, {"cnt":3, "decision":"harding"}]

Conclusion
- The data show that "backstrom" appears 11 times and "harding" appears 3 times in the decision column. Therefore, Backstrom was the decision more often than Harding. This directly contradicts the claim that Harding appeared more times than Backstrom.

Assumptions
- decision contains the last name of the goaltender of record for the game; values "backstrom" and "harding" correspond to Niklas Backstrom and Josh Harding respectively.
- The claim is about counts of occurrences in the decision field within this specific table representing the 2007–08 season game log.
