Claim to verify: “lgplv2 be the license for rygel.”

Data sources consulted:
- PostgreSQL database via postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table: comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers (contains project names and licenses).

Method:
1) Discovered available data sources and identified a table that lists UPnP/AV media servers with their licenses.
2) Queried the table for the project named “Rygel” to retrieve its license.

Evidence (executed SQL and result):
- SQL:
  SELECT name, license FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name ILIKE '%Rygel%';

- Result:
  name = rygel
  license = lgplv2

Assessment:
- The table directly lists “rygel” with license “lgplv2,” which supports the claim that Rygel’s license is LGPLv2 (as represented in this dataset).

Conclusion:
- The evidence supports the claim as stated in the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as: “Rygel is licensed under LGPLv2.”
- Assumed the “license” field reflects the canonical license designation for the project within this dataset.
