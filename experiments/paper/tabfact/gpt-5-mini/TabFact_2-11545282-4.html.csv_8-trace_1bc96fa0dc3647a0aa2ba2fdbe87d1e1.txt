What I verified
- Claim: “James Donaldson had 2 stints on the Jazz’s roster, totaling 5 years.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact1)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Why this table is relevant
- It is an all-time roster for the Utah Jazz with a “years for jazz” field indicating a player’s tenure periods.

Evidence gathered (with executed SQL)
1) Locate James Donaldson in the Utah Jazz all-time roster
- SQL (exact match; 0 rows):
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player = 'James Donaldson';
- SQL (case-insensitive by last name; 1 row):
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Donaldson%';
- Result:
  player: james donaldson | position: center | years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95

2) Compute number of stints and seasons from the “years for jazz” string
- SQL (confirm columns):
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'utah_jazz_all_time_roster';
- SQL (fetch raw years string):
  SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Donaldson%';
- SQL (derive counts):
  SELECT player,
         "years for jazz" AS years_raw,
         (1 + (length("years for jazz") - length(replace("years for jazz", ',', ''))))::int AS stints_count,
         (SELECT count(*)
            FROM unnest(regexp_split_to_array("years for jazz", ',')) AS t(tok)
           WHERE btrim(tok) <> '') AS seasons_estimate
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE player ILIKE 'james donaldson';
- Result:
  years_raw: 1993 , 1994 - 95
  stints_count: 2
  seasons_estimate: 2

Interpretation
- The table lists two separate stints for James Donaldson with the Utah Jazz: one labeled “1993” and another labeled “1994 - 95.”
- Treating each comma-separated entry as one stint aligns with stints_count = 2.
- Each entry corresponds to one NBA season (1993 likely denotes the 1992–93 season; “1994 - 95” denotes the 1994–95 season). That totals 2 seasons, not 5 years.

Conclusion
- The claim that James Donaldson had two stints with the Jazz is supported by the data.
- The claim that these stints totaled five years is contradicted by the data; the available record indicates approximately two seasons in total.

Assumptions
- “1993” corresponds to the 1992–93 NBA season and “1994 - 95” corresponds to the 1994–95 season. In this roster context, each comma-separated token is treated as one season and a “YYYY - YY” token denotes a single season.
- No other Jazz roster periods for James Donaldson exist beyond what is listed in the all-time roster table.
