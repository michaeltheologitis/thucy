Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with a public schema containing one relevant table: public.will_grace_season_5. Columns include: series (bigint), season (text), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), original air date (text), us viewers (millions) (double precision).

Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect episodes and their series numbers to understand mapping between “season” (episode number within season) and “series” (overall series number):
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, title
FROM public.will_grace_season_5
ORDER BY
  (CASE WHEN season ~ '^\d+$' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END),
  (CASE WHEN season ~ '^\d+$' THEN season::int END),
  season ASC;

Results excerpt (season | series | title):
- 10 | 101 | the honeymoon 's over
- 11 | 102 | all about christmas eve
- 12 | 103 | field of queens
- 8 - 9 | 100 | marry me a little , marry me a little more
This shows that the 10th episode (season = '10') maps to series = 101, while series = 103 corresponds to the 12th episode (season = '12').

2) Direct lookup for the 10th episode (season = '10'):
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, title FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE season = '10';

Result:
- season: 10
- series: 101
- title: the honeymoon 's over

Conclusion
The claim “the series number for the episode number 10 be 103.0” is contradicted by the data. For episode number 10, the series number is 101 (not 103). The value 103 corresponds to episode number 12.

Assumptions
- “episode number 10” refers to the episode’s ordinal within season 5 (the season column), not the overall series ordinal.
- The decimal formatting (103.0) is treated as numerically equivalent to 103.
