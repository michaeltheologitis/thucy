Claim: "during week 1, the game start at 9:00 pm"

Data discovery and schema context:
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact" (schema: public).
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1977_pittsburgh_steelers_season
  - Columns: week, date, opponent, time ( et ), result, record, game site
  - Interpreted as the 1977 Pittsburgh Steelers schedule and results.

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, "time ( et )" FROM public.t_1977_pittsburgh_steelers_season WHERE week = 1;
- Result:
  - week: 1
  - date: monday september 19
  - opponent: san francisco 49ers
  - time ( et ): 9:00 pm

Assessment:
- The Week 1 entry in the table shows the game time (ET) as 9:00 pm. This directly supports the claim that during week 1, the game starts at 9:00 pm.

Conclusion: The data confirms the claim.

Assumptions made:
- "the game" refers to the Week 1 game listed in the table t_1977_pittsburgh_steelers_season (the 1977 Pittsburgh Steelers season). Time is interpreted as Eastern Time as labeled in the column name (time ( et )).
