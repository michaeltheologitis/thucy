Claim to verify: Was Dallas the opponent in the game where the entry “Austin Daye (16)” corresponds to the lowest points for Austin Daye (as recorded in the season table)?

Data environment summary
- We identified one relevant table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (2010–11 Detroit Pistons season, with per-game top performer summaries). Columns: game, date, team (opponent), score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

Evidence 1: Find Austin Daye high-points games and sort by points ascending
- Exact SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team AS opponent, "high points", (substring("high points" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int AS points
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high points" ILIKE 'Austin Daye%'
ORDER BY points ASC;
- Result (ordered by points):
  - game 4 | date: october 13 | opponent: dallas | high points: austin daye (16) | points: 16
  - game 5 | date: october 15 | opponent: minnesota | high points: austin daye (18) | points: 18
  - game 2 | date: october 8 | opponent: milwaukee | high points: austin daye (21) | points: 21
- Interpretation: Austin Daye’s lowest “high points” total in this table is 16, and the opponent in that game was Dallas.

Evidence 2: Confirm that 16 is the minimum “high points” value overall and list all games achieving it
- Exact SQL executed (minimum):
SELECT MIN((substring("high points" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int) AS min_points FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
- Result: min_points = 16
- Exact SQL executed (games with that minimum):
SELECT game, date, team, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE (substring("high points" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int = (
  SELECT MIN((substring("high points" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
)
ORDER BY game;
- Result:
  - game 3 | date: october 11 | team: atlanta | high points: rodney stuckey (16)
  - game 4 | date: october 13 | team: dallas   | high points: austin daye (16)
- Interpretation: The overall minimum “high points” in the dataset is 16, achieved in two games. One of them is specifically “Austin Daye (16)” vs Dallas, confirming the opponent for Austin Daye’s 16-point entry was Dallas.

Conclusion
- The data shows that when “Austin Daye (16)” appears as the high-points entry, the opponent listed is Dallas. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Dallas” is taken from the table’s team column, which represents the opponent.
- “Austin Daye (16)” refers to the string in the high points column (player name with points in parentheses) and “lowest point” refers to the lowest such point total for Austin Daye within this table.
