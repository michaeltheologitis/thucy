Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.long_jump with columns: mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text)

Evidence collected
1) Verify athlete name entries present
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete
FROM public.long_jump
WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Walder%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Beamon%';
Results:
- bob beamon
- erick walder

2) List all rows for these athletes
SQL executed:
SELECT athlete, mark, wind, venue, date
FROM public.long_jump
WHERE lower(athlete) IN ('bob beamon', 'erick walder')
ORDER BY athlete, date;
Results:
- athlete: bob beamon | mark: 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a | wind: 2 | venue: mexico city | date: october 18 , 1968
- athlete: erick walder | mark: 8.74 m (28ft8in) a | wind: 2 | venue: el paso | date: april 2 , 1994

3) Distinct wind values per athlete
SQL executed:
SELECT athlete, array_agg(DISTINCT wind) AS distinct_winds
FROM public.long_jump
WHERE lower(athlete) IN ('bob beamon', 'erick walder')
GROUP BY athlete
ORDER BY athlete;
Results:
- bob beamon: [2]
- erick walder: [2]

Conclusion
- The database shows both Bob Beamon and Erick Walder have wind values of 2 (m/s) for their recorded entries. Therefore, they have the same wind reading in this data.

Assumptions
- “Same wind” is interpreted as the recorded wind reading in the long_jump table for these athletes’ entries.
- Name matching was done case-insensitively using the stored forms “bob beamon” and “erick walder.”
