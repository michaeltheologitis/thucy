Claim to verify: “there have be 19 game since 13 august 2005 which have an attendance of 60000 or more.”

Data source discovery
- Using the available tools, I discovered one accessible database: postgres_tabfact4 (public schema).
- Identified table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season.

Schema details (from the public schema)
- Table: t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text)
  - No primary keys or foreign keys defined.

Exploration of date format (to ensure correct filtering by date)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season LIMIT 10;
Returned sample rows (abridged):
- '13 august 2005', 38610
- '20 august 2005', 67934
- '28 august 2005', 52327
- '10 september 2005', 67839
- '18 september 2005', 44917
- '24 september 2005', 67765
- …
Interpretation: Dates are stored as text like '13 august 2005'. I parse them with to_date(initcap(date), 'DD Month YYYY').

Verification queries and results
1) Chronological list of qualifying matches (attendance >= 60000, on or after 13 August 2005)
Executed SQL:
SELECT to_date(initcap(date), 'DD Month YYYY') AS match_date, date AS date_text, attendance
FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE to_date(initcap(date), 'DD Month YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005','DD Month YYYY')
  AND attendance >= 60000
ORDER BY match_date;
Results (match_date — attendance):
- 2005-08-20 — 67934
- 2005-09-10 — 67839
- 2005-09-24 — 67765
- 2005-10-22 — 67856
- 2005-11-06 — 67864
- 2005-12-03 — 67684
- 2005-12-11 — 67831
- 2005-12-14 — 67793
- 2005-12-26 — 67972
- 2005-12-31 — 67858
- 2006-01-22 — 67874
- 2006-02-04 — 67844
- 2006-03-12 — 67858
- 2006-03-26 — 69070
- 2006-03-29 — 69522
- 2006-04-09 — 70908
- 2006-04-14 — 72519
- 2006-05-01 — 69531
- 2006-05-07 — 73006

2) Count of qualifying matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE to_date(initcap(date), 'DD Month YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005','DD Month YYYY')
  AND attendance >= 60000;
Result: 19

Conclusion
- The data shows 19 matches on or after 13 August 2005 with attendance of at least 60,000. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Since 13 august 2005” is treated as inclusive of that date. The match on 13 August 2005 had attendance 38,610 and thus does not qualify, which aligns with the count.
- Verification is based on the only available authoritative dataset (Manchester United 2005–06 season table).
