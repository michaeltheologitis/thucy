Claim: “the Zakspeed 861 chassis be made in the year 1986 and 1987.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25). Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.zakspeed with columns year (bigint), chassis (text), "engine (s)" (text), tyres (text), points (bigint).

Evidence gathered
1) Check for exact chassis value 861
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis = '861';
- Result:
  count = 0

Interpretation: No rows use an exact chassis value of just “861”, so we next look for rows where the chassis field mentions “861”.

2) Retrieve all rows where chassis mentions 861 (substring match), sorted by year
- SQL:
  SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)", tyres, points
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE chassis LIKE '%861%'
  ORDER BY year ASC;
- Results:
  • year: 1986 | chassis: zakspeed 861 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c | tyres: g | points: 0
  • year: 1987 | chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c | tyres: g | points: 2

3) Confirm distinct years where chassis mentions 861
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis ILIKE '%861%' ORDER BY year ASC;
- Results:
  • 1986
  • 1987

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the Zakspeed chassis list includes “861” in 1986 and again in 1987 (paired with “871” in 1987). This supports the claim that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was present/used in both 1986 and 1987.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “be made” as “present/used/produced for competition” in the recorded seasons.
- Interpreted “Zakspeed 861” matches by substring within the chassis column, since the table uses full strings like “zakspeed 861” and combined entries like “zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871.”
