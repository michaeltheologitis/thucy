Claim to verify: “the cardinalatial order and title of bosone be cardinal - priest of s anastasia.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table identified: public.papal_election_1119 with columns [elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, elevator]

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT elector, "cardinalatial order and title" FROM papal_election_1119 WHERE elector ILIKE '%bos%';

- Result:
  elector: bosone
  cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s anastasia

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists an elector named “bosone” with the “cardinalatial order and title” recorded as “cardinal - priest of s anastasia.” This matches the claim exactly (allowing for lowercase and spacing/formatting as presented in the data).

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the database record.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the individual “bosone” as represented in the papal_election_1119 table. The abbreviation “s” in the title is interpreted as “Saint,” consistent with the table’s formatting.
