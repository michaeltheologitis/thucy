Claim to verify: "carlos cuéllar have the lowest transfer fee of any player at 7.8 m"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season.

Schema overview (from schema inspection)
- Table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
- Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text)

Evidence 1: Sample rows to understand table content
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season LIMIT 5;
- Result excerpt (shows typical values and that many rows have transfer fee recorded as text like "n / a"):
  1) nat: sco; name: nicholas gallacher; moving to: motherwell; type: end of contract; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: n / a
  2) nat: ivory coast; name: lacine cherif; moving to: kilmarnock; type: end of contract; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: n / a
  3) nat: sco; name: alistair park; moving to: hibernian; type: end of contract; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: n / a
  4) nat: eng; name: michael donald; moving to: free agent; type: end of contract; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: n / a
  5) nat: sco; name: calum reidford; moving to: dunfermline athletic; type: end of contract; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: n / a

Evidence 2: Locate Carlos Cuéllar’s row and fee
- SQL executed (to find exact spelling):
  SELECT DISTINCT name FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE lower(name) LIKE '%cuell%' OR lower(name) LIKE '%carlos%'
  LIMIT 50;
- Returned: carlos cuéllar
- SQL executed (to fetch his transfer details):
  SELECT name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee"
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE name = 'carlos cuéllar';
- Result:
  name: carlos cuéllar; moving to: aston villa; type: transfer; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: 7.8 m

Evidence 3: Distribution of transfer fee values across the table
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "transfer fee" AS transfer_fee, COUNT(*) AS occurrences
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  GROUP BY "transfer fee"
  ORDER BY occurrences DESC, transfer_fee;
- Results:
  - n / a — 28
  - free — 2
  - 1 m — 1
  - 3.5 m — 1
  - 7.8 m — 1

Evidence 4: Identify the minimum transfer fee numerically
- SQL executed (inspect distinct fee formats):
  SELECT DISTINCT "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season ORDER BY "transfer fee";
- Result: 1 m; 3.5 m; 7.8 m; free; n / a
- SQL executed (compute numeric fee per row, treating 'free' as 0, ignoring 'n / a'):
  SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer fee", 
  CASE WHEN lower(trim("transfer fee"))='free' THEN 0
  WHEN lower("transfer fee") LIKE '%m%' THEN cast(regexp_replace(lower("transfer fee"), '[^0-9\\.]','', 'g') AS numeric)
  ELSE NULL END as fee_millions
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE lower(trim("transfer fee")) <> 'n / a'
  ORDER BY fee_millions NULLS LAST;
- Result (ordered by fee):
  - jean - claude darcheville — valenciennes — transfer fee: free — fee_millions: 0
  - chris burke — cardiff city — transfer fee: free — fee_millions: 0
  - filip šebo — valenciennes — transfer fee: 1 m — fee_millions: 1
  - daniel cousin — hull city — transfer fee: 3.5 m — fee_millions: 3.5
  - carlos cuéllar — aston villa — transfer fee: 7.8 m — fee_millions: 7.8
- SQL executed (return rows at the absolute minimum):
  WITH fees AS (
    SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer fee",
      CASE
        WHEN lower(trim("transfer fee"))='free' THEN 0
        WHEN lower("transfer fee") LIKE '%m%' THEN cast(regexp_replace(lower("transfer fee"), '[^0-9\\.]','', 'g') AS numeric)
        ELSE NULL
      END AS fee_millions
    FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
    WHERE lower(trim("transfer fee")) <> 'n / a'
  )
  SELECT (SELECT MIN(fee_millions) FROM fees) AS min_fee_millions, name, "moving to", "transfer fee"
  FROM fees
  WHERE fee_millions = (SELECT MIN(fee_millions) FROM fees);
- Result:
  - min_fee_millions: 0; name: jean - claude darcheville; moving to: valenciennes; transfer fee: free
  - min_fee_millions: 0; name: chris burke; moving to: cardiff city; transfer fee: free

Analysis
- Carlos Cuéllar’s transfer fee in this dataset is 7.8 m (millions), confirmed.
- However, this is not the lowest recorded fee. There are transfers marked as free (treated as 0), and among numeric fees the lowest is 1 m. Therefore, 7.8 m is actually the highest numeric fee in this table, not the lowest.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Carlos Cuéllar does not have the lowest transfer fee; his 7.8 m fee is higher than other recorded fees (free, 1 m, 3.5 m).

Assumptions and notes
- I interpreted 'm' as millions and treated 'free' as 0; 'n / a' entries were excluded from numeric comparisons.
- The scope of verification is constrained to the available dataset (Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season transfers). "Any player" was interpreted as any player in this table because no broader dataset was accessible.
