Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One accessible database (TabFact, postgres_tabfact5) with a single relevant table: public.my_info_table (columns: date, visitor, score, home, record).

Schema check (teams present in table)
Evidence (exact executed SQL and results):
1) Distinct values from home
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT home FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY home;
Returned rows:
- buffalo
- chicago
- new jersey
- philadelphia
- pittsburgh
- st louis
- washington

SELECT DISTINCT visitor FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY visitor;
Returned rows:
- buffalo
- detroit
- minnesota
- new jersey
- ny islanders
- vancouver

3) Combined distinct team names
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM (SELECT home AS team FROM public.my_info_table UNION SELECT visitor AS team FROM public.my_info_table) t ORDER BY team;
Returned rows:
- buffalo
- chicago
- detroit
- minnesota
- new jersey
- ny islanders
- philadelphia
- pittsburgh
- st louis
- vancouver
- washington

Key observation from schema data: “vancouver” appears only as a visitor in this dataset’s distinct values, not as a home team.

Direct test of the claim (Is there any game with home = vancouver and visitor = new jersey?)
Evidence (exact executed SQL and result):
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(home) = 'vancouver' AND lower(visitor) = 'new jersey';
Result:
match_count = 0

Related context checks
A) All games with home = 'vancouver'
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(home)) = 'vancouver';
Result: no rows returned (no vancouver home games in this table)

B) All games with visitor = 'new jersey'
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(visitor)) = 'new jersey';
Returned rows:
- february 5 | visitor: new jersey | score: 4 - 5 | home: washington | record: 11 - 33 - 11
- february 9 | visitor: new jersey | score: 4 - 5 | home: chicago | record: 11 - 34 - 12
- february 12 | visitor: new jersey | score: 1 - 5 | home: st louis | record: 11 - 35 - 12
- february 20 | visitor: new jersey | score: 0 - 3 | home: philadelphia | record: 11 - 37 - 12
- february 26 | visitor: new jersey | score: 4 - 5 | home: pittsburgh | record: 12 - 38 - 13
- february 27 | visitor: new jersey | score: 2 - 6 | home: buffalo | record: 12 - 39 - 13

C) Opposite fixture (home = new jersey, visitor = vancouver)
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE home ILIKE 'new jersey' AND visitor ILIKE 'vancouver';
Returned row:
- february 6 | visitor: vancouver | score: 4 - 4 | home: new jersey | record: 11 - 33 - 12

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no games where Vancouver is the home team, and specifically none where New Jersey is the visiting team against a Vancouver home team. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.
- The only Vancouver–New Jersey matchup present shows Vancouver as the visiting team and New Jersey as the home team (not the other way around).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as asserting that there exist game record(s) where visitor = 'new jersey' and home = 'vancouver'.
- Matching performed case-insensitively (using lower(...) or ILIKE) to account for potential capitalization differences.
- Verification is limited to the authoritative dataset discovered (public.my_info_table in the TabFact database).
