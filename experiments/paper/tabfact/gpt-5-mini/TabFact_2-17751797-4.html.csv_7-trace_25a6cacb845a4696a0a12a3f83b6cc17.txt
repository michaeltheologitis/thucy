Claim interpreted: “The score was 1–0 and the home team was Bolton Wanderers.” I interpret this as asserting there exists a match with Bolton Wanderers as the HOME team and a 1–0 score.

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: TabFact database
- Available table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup (appears to contain 1990–91 FA Cup match data)

Table schema (from discovery)
- Columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text)

Evidence
1) Sample rows to confirm data content and whether Bolton appears
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", score, "away team", date FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup LIMIT 50;
Observed relevant row in results:
- tie no: 11 | home team: manchester united | score: 1 - 0 | away team: bolton wanderers | date: 26 / 01 / 1991
Interpretation: Bolton Wanderers appear as the AWAY team in a 1–0 match; this does not support the claim that Bolton Wanderers were the HOME team in a 1–0 match.

2) Direct check: Does any row have Bolton Wanderers as HOME team with a 1–0 score?
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%bolton wanderers%'
  AND translate("score", '–—', '--') ~ '^[[:space:]]*1[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*$';
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: No match in this table has Bolton Wanderers as the home team with a 1–0 score.

3) Sanity check: Does Bolton appear as HOME team at all in this dataset?
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%bolton%';
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: In this dataset, Bolton Wanderers do not appear as the home team in any listed match.

Conclusion
- The available data does not support the claim. While there is a 1–0 match involving Bolton Wanderers, they are the AWAY team (vs. Manchester United) rather than the HOME team. No entries exist with Bolton Wanderers as the home side in a 1–0 result in this table.

Assumptions
- “Bolton wanderer” is interpreted as the club Bolton Wanderers.
- “1 - 0” is treated flexibly (allowing spaces and different dash characters) when matching score text.
- The claim is evaluated against the only available authoritative dataset (public.t_1990_91_fa_cup), presumed to represent 1990–91 FA Cup matches.
