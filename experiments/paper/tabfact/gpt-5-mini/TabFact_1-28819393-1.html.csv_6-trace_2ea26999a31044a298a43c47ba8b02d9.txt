What I checked
- The claim: “In 1997, there were 145 candidates and 0.21 was the total percentage of vote.”
- Data source: TabFact.public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results (treated as authoritative per instructions)

Findings from the data
1) 1997 figures
- Result: candidates = 89; % of total vote = 0.21
- Evidence (exact SQL executed):
  SELECT candidates, "% of total vote" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE year = '1997';
- Returned row: {"candidates": 89, "% of total vote": 0.21}
- Interpretation: The Green Party of England and Wales had 89 candidates in 1997, with a 0.21% share of the total vote.

2) Cross-check of nearby years (to locate the “145 candidates” figure)
- Evidence (exact SQL executed):
  SELECT year, candidates, "% of total vote" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results ORDER BY year ASC;
- Returned rows include:
  - 1997: candidates 89, % of total vote 0.21
  - 2001: candidates 145, % of total vote 0.63
- Interpretation: The figure of 145 candidates corresponds to the year 2001, not 1997.

Conclusion
- The statement is partly incorrect: the total percentage of vote (0.21%) for 1997 is correct, but the number of candidates in 1997 was 89, not 145. The “145 candidates” figure matches the year 2001 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Total percentage of vote” refers to the “% of total vote” column in the Green Party of England and Wales election results table.
- The value 0.21 in the dataset represents 0.21% (percentage points), not 21%.
