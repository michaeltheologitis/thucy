Summary
The claim states that “Joliette Township has a GEO ID of 3806741020.” Using the available authoritative data source (TabFact database), I verified the GEO ID for Joliette Township in North Dakota.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
  - Columns include: township (text), county (text), geo id (bigint), and others.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve GEO ID for Joliette
- SQL executed:
  SELECT township, county, "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE township ILIKE '%Joliette%';
- Result:
  - township: joliette
  - county: pembina
  - geo id: 3806741020

2) Confirm uniqueness with case-insensitive equality
- SQL executed (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE lower(trim(township)) = lower(trim('Joliette'));
- Result:
  - count: 1

- SQL executed (details):
  SELECT county, "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE lower(trim(township)) = lower(trim('Joliette'));
- Result:
  - county: pembina, geo id: 3806741020

Conclusion
The data shows one entry for Joliette (township) in Pembina County, North Dakota, with GEO ID 3806741020. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “geo id” refers to the “geo id” field in the list_of_townships_in_north_dakota table.
- The township name in the table is stored as “joliette” (lowercase) without the literal word “Township,” but it denotes the township entity in Pembina County, ND.
- The TabFact dataset is authoritative for North Dakota township GEO IDs.
