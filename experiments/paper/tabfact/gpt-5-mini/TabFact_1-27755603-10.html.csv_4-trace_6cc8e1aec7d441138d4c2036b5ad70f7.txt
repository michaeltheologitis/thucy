Claim being checked: “there be 4 instance where there be a tie for most rebound by detroit piston player during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season.”

Conclusion: The data shows 4 games in this period where multiple Detroit Pistons players tied for the team-high in rebounds. Therefore, the claim is supported.

Evidence from the data

1) Context (total rows in this period table)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
Result:
- total_games = 12

2) Definition of a tie and count of ties
- Operational definition: a “tie for team-high rebounds” is when the "high rebounds" column lists more than one player, which appears in this dataset as multiple names separated by commas.

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tie_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
  AND "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%';
Result:
- tie_count: 4

3) Games with ties for team-high rebounds (details)
SQL executed:
SELECT "game", "date", "team", "high rebounds"
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
  AND "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%'
ORDER BY "game";
Results:
- game: 62, date: march 1,    team: milwaukee, high rebounds: greg monroe , charlie villanueva (9)
- game: 64, date: march 6,    team: washington, high rebounds: greg monroe , rodney stuckey (7)
- game: 67, date: march 12,   team: denver,     high rebounds: austin daye , ben gordon , greg monroe (6)
- game: 72, date: march 25,   team: cleveland,  high rebounds: chris wilcox , greg monroe (8)

These four rows explicitly show multiple players sharing the team-high rebound total, matching the claimed count of four instances.

Assumptions
- “This period” is interpreted as the set of games represented in the available table public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season, which appears to cover a March 2011 segment of the 2010–2011 season (12 games).
- A tie is identified by multiple player names separated by commas in the "high rebounds" text field; no other tie markers were observed in this dataset.
