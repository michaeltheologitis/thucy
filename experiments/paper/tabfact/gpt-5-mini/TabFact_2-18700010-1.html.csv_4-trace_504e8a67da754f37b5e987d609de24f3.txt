Claim being checked: “the only player that doesn't have 0 FA Cup goal [is] Peter Hart.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season with columns including name, position, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup goals, total goals.

What the data shows
1) Players with non-zero FA Cup goals
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "fa cup goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" > 0;
- Result:
  - name: "peter hart", fa cup goals: 1

2) Count of players with non-zero FA Cup goals
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_nonzero_fa_cup_goals FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" > 0;
- Result:
  - count_nonzero_fa_cup_goals: 1

3) Totals and players with zero FA Cup goals
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_players FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;
- Result:
  - total_players: 18

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS fa_cup_goals_zero_count FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" = 0;
- Result:
  - fa_cup_goals_zero_count: 17

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly one player with non-zero FA Cup goals, and that player is Peter Hart (1 FA Cup goal). All other players in the table have 0 FA Cup goals. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: within this dataset (1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season table), the only player whose FA Cup goals are not zero is Peter Hart. Name matching was treated case-insensitively ("peter hart" in the data).
