Claim to verify: “when michael beade be the highest scorer, the score be w 97 - 92 (ot)”

Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL (public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season)

Step 1 — Inspect table format (evidence):
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season LIMIT 10;
Returned sample includes:
- game 76 | date: april 3 | opponent: charlotte | score: w 97 - 92 (ot) | high points: dwyane wade (27)
- game 81 | date: april 14 | opponent: atlanta | score: l 79 - 81 (ot) | high points: michael beasley (23)

Step 2 — Find all games where Michael Beasley was the high scorer (evidence):
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Michael Beasley%';
Result:
- date: april 14 | opponent: atlanta | score: l 79 - 81 (ot) | high points: michael beasley (23)
Interpretation: In this table, Michael Beasley is listed as the high scorer in one game, which was a 79–81 overtime loss, not a 97–92 OT win.

Step 3 — Locate the game with score exactly “w 97 - 92 (ot)” (evidence):
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season WHERE score = 'w 97 - 92 (ot)';
Result:
- date: april 3 | opponent: charlotte | score: w 97 - 92 (ot) | high points: dwyane wade (27)
Interpretation: The 97–92 OT win lists Dwyane Wade, not Michael Beasley, as the high scorer.

Conclusion:
- The OT win 97–92 had Dwyane Wade as the high scorer, not Michael Beasley.
- When Michael Beasley was the high scorer (april 14 vs. Atlanta), the score was a 79–81 OT loss.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in the available source.

Assumptions made:
- “michael beade” refers to “Michael Beasley.”
- “highest scorer” corresponds to the table’s “high points” field (player name with points).
- The “score” text is interpreted literally as stored (e.g., “w 97 - 92 (ot)”).
