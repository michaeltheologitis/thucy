Data source discovery
- Connected database: postgres_tabfact13 (TabFact Postgres), schema: public
- Relevant table discovered: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 (columns include district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates)

Evidence from the data
1) Confirm table structure (executed SQL):
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942';
Returned columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (text), result (text), candidates (text)

2) Find entries for Cecil R. King (executed SQL):
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Cecil%'
   OR candidates ILIKE '%Cecil%';
Result:
- district: california 17
- incumbent: cecil r king
- party: democratic
- first elected: august 25 , 1942
- result: re - elected
- candidates: cecil r king (d) unopposed
Interpretation: In 1942, Cecil R. King was the incumbent for California’s 17th district and was re-elected (unopposed).

3) Check the row for district “california 10” (executed SQL):
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE district = 'california 10';
Result:
- district: california 10
- incumbent: alfred j elliott
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1937
- result: re - elected
- candidates: alfred j elliott (d) unopposed
Interpretation: In 1942, the incumbent for California’s 10th district was Alfred J. Elliott, not Cecil R. King; Elliott was re-elected.

Conclusion
- The statement that Cecil R. King was re-elected is supported, but he represented California’s 17th district in 1942, not the 10th. In California’s 10th district, Alfred J. Elliott was the incumbent and he was re-elected. Therefore, the district detail in the claim is incorrect while the re-election outcome for King (in CA-17) is correct.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the 1942 United States House of Representatives elections, as that is the available dataset. If a different year was intended, the available data does not cover it.
