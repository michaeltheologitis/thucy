Summary of approach
- Discovered and inspected the available data sources, which include a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season. This table contains game-by-game entries with date, opponent, score, losing pitcher, attendance, and the Blue Jays’ cumulative record after each game.

Key evidence from data
1) Sampling rows to understand formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
LIMIT 15;
Findings:
- Dates are stored as lowercase month name plus day (e.g., "september 1").
- Opponents are lowercase names (e.g., "red sox").
- The record column reflects the Blue Jays’ cumulative record after that game.

2) Locate the September 28 entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%28%' AND (date ILIKE '%Sep%' OR date ILIKE '%September%');
Result:
- date: september 28
- opponent: red sox
- score: 3 - 2
- loss: gordon (6 - 10)
- attendance: 40251
- record: 76 - 86
Interpretation:
- The losing pitcher listed is Gordon, who (in 1997) was a Red Sox pitcher; this indicates the Red Sox took the loss and the Blue Jays won this game 3–2. The Blue Jays’ record after the game is 76–86.

3) Verify record progression around September 28
Executed SQL (distinct September dates present):
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date ILIKE 'september%' ORDER BY date;
Executed SQL (retrieve 26–29 September rows):
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date IN ('september 26','september 27','september 28','september 29') ORDER BY date;
Results:
- september 26 | opponent: red sox | score: 3 - 0  | loss: henry (7 - 3)   | record: 74 - 86
- september 27 | opponent: red sox | score: 12 - 5 | loss: corsi (5 - 3)   | record: 75 - 86
- september 28 | opponent: red sox | score: 3 - 2  | loss: gordon (6 - 10) | record: 76 - 86
Observations:
- There is no "september 29" row in the table; September 28 appears to be the final recorded game.
- The record progression confirms wins on September 27 and 28 (moving from 74–86 to 75–86 to 76–86).

Assessment of the claim
- Accurate elements:
  - On September 28 the opponent was the Red Sox.
  - The Blue Jays’ record after that game was 76–86.
- Inaccurate elements:
  - The Blue Jays did not lose on September 28; the data show the losing pitcher was from Boston (Gordon), and the Blue Jays’ record improved from 75–86 to 76–86, indicating a Blue Jays win, not a loss.
  - The wording “fell to 76–86” is inconsistent with the record progression; their record improved to 76–86 (they did not fall).

Conclusion
- The statement is partially incorrect: while the date, opponent, and post-game record are correct, the outcome is wrong. The Blue Jays beat the Red Sox on September 28, and their record improved to 76–86.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “blue jay” as the MLB Toronto Blue Jays.
- Interpreted the claim’s September 28 as the September 28 within the available season dataset (1997), since that is the only accessible data source containing Blue Jays vs. Red Sox results and post-game records.
