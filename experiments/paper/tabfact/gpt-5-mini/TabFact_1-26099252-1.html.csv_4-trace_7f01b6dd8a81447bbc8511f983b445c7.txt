Claim to verify: “when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0, the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22)
- Relevant table: public.html5_video with columns: browser (text), operating system (text), latest stable release (text), theora (text), h264 (text), vp8 ( webm ) (text), vp9 ( webm ) (text)

Evidence 1: What is the vp8 ( webm ) value when theora = '2.3' and h264 = '3.0'?
Executed SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", theora, h264, "vp8 ( webm )" FROM public.html5_video WHERE theora = '2.3' AND h264 = '3.0';
Result (1 row):
- browser: android browser; operating system: android; theora: 2.3; h264: 3.0; vp8 ( webm ): 2.3
Interpretation: For the only row where theora = 2.3 and h264 = 3.0, vp8 ( webm ) equals 2.3, not r47759.

Evidence 2: Where does vp8 ( webm ) = 'r47759' appear, if anywhere?
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE "vp8 ( webm )" LIKE '%r47759%';
Result (1 row):
- browser: chromium; operating system: all supported; latest stable release: n / a; theora: r18297; h264: manual install; vp8 ( webm ): r47759; vp9 ( webm ): r172738
Interpretation: The value r47759 for vp8 ( webm ) exists, but in a row where theora ≠ 2.3 (it is r18297) and h264 ≠ 3.0 (it is manual install).

Evidence 3: Direct check for a row matching all three conditions simultaneously
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.html5_video
WHERE theora = '2.3' AND h264 = '3.0' AND "vp8 ( webm )" = 'r47759';
Result: cnt = 0
Interpretation: There is no row where theora = 2.3, h264 = 3.0, and vp8 ( webm ) = r47759 at the same time.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. When theora is 2.3 and h264 is 3.0, vp8 ( webm ) is 2.3 (not r47759). While r47759 appears as a vp8 ( webm ) value in another row, it does not coincide with theora 2.3 and h264 3.0.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to codec support/version fields as represented in the public.html5_video table described above.
- Exact text equality was used for matching values (case- and whitespace-sensitive) as per the executed SQL.
