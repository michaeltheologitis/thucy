Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL (TabFact) public schema with one relevant table: public.t_1972_vfl_season

Schema highlights (from schema inspection):
- Columns include "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).
- Scores are stored as text like "goals.behinds (total)"; the total points are inside parentheses.

Step 1 — Inspect available rows to understand data scope and format
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, "date" FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Result (all 6 rows in table):
- footscray | 14.7 (91) | st kilda | 9.11 (65) | western oval | 18655 | 15 july 1972
- fitzroy | 16.14 (110) | north melbourne | 9.12 (66) | junction oval | 7007 | 15 july 1972
- essendon | 13.12 (90) | richmond | 17.9 (111) | windy hill | 22251 | 15 july 1972
- carlton | 20.8 (128) | south melbourne | 8.15 (63) | princes park | 14465 | 15 july 1972
- hawthorn | 19.14 (128) | geelong | 15.8 (98) | glenferrie oval | 12425 | 15 july 1972
- collingwood | 10.13 (73) | melbourne | 8.10 (58) | vfl park | 30883 | 15 july 1972

To confirm total row count:
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Result:
- total_rows = 6
Interpretation: The dataset covers 6 matches (all dated 15 July 1972).

Step 2 — Identify away team(s) with the lowest total points
Approach: Parse the integer inside parentheses from "away team score" as total points.
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "away team",
         ((regexp_matches("away team score", '\((\d+)\)'))[1])::int AS away_points
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT "away team", away_points
FROM parsed
WHERE away_points = (SELECT MIN(away_points) FROM parsed)
ORDER BY away_points ASC;
Result:
- melbourne | 58

Step 3 — Show all away-team totals to verify ordering
SQL executed:
SELECT "away team", CAST(substring("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS away_points
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
WHERE substring("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY away_points ASC;
Results (ascending):
- melbourne — 58
- south melbourne — 63
- st kilda — 65
- north melbourne — 66
- geelong — 98
- richmond — 111

Conclusion:
- In the available dataset (6 matches on 15 July 1972), Melbourne recorded the lowest away-team total points (58). No other away team scored fewer points in these matches.

Assumptions noted:
- Scope: I interpret your claim within the only available dataset (public.t_1972_vfl_season), which contains 6 matches on 15 July 1972.
- Definition of "score": The total points shown in parentheses within the score string (e.g., 8.10 (58) -> 58).
- Team identity: "melbourne" refers to the away team labeled exactly as "melbourne" in this table.
