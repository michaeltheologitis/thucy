What I checked and how

1) Discovered available data
- Purpose: Confirm what data is available to verify the claim.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  ORDER BY table_name;
- Result: One table in the public schema: t_1996_pga_championship

2) Understood the table structure
- Purpose: Inspect columns and data types, especially the money field.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_1996_pga_championship';
- Result: Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text), money (bigint).

3) Identify who earned the most money in the table
- Purpose: Rank players by money and find the top earner(s).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, money
  FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
  WHERE money IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY money DESC, player;
- Result (top rows):
  - mark brooks — 430000
  - kenny perry — 260000
  - steve elkington — 140000
  - tommy tolles — 140000
  - jesper parnevik — 86667
  - justin leonard — 86667
  - vijay singh — 86667
  - Others at 57500

- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(money) AS max_money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE money IS NOT NULL;
- Result: max_money = 430000

- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, money
  FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
  WHERE money = (
    SELECT MAX(money) FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE money IS NOT NULL
  )
  ORDER BY player;
- Result: mark brooks — 430000 (no ties)

4) Check the exact spelling “mark brook” vs “mark brooks”
- Purpose: Confirm whether the table contains “mark brook” or the closely related “mark brooks”.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(player) = 'mark brook';
- Result: No rows returned.

- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT player FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(player) LIKE 'mark brook%';
- Result: mark brooks

Conclusion
- The player with the highest money in the available dataset (t_1996_pga_championship) is mark brooks with 430000. There is no exact entry for “mark brook,” but “mark brooks” clearly matches and is the top earner.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (t_1996_pga_championship) and interprets “the player who earn the most money” as the player with the maximum value in the money column for this table.
- The name “mark brook” is interpreted as “mark brooks” due to close spelling and the exact match found in the data.
- Case-insensitive comparisons were used when checking player name variants.
