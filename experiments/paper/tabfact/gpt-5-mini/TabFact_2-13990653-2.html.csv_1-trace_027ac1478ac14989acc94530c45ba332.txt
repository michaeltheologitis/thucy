Claim: “pan wei - lun lose against chinatrust whale.”

Conclusion: The data show that Pan Wei-Lun was the losing pitcher in a game against the Chinatrust Whales during the 2007 Uni-President Lions season. This supports the claim (noting the team name is plural: “Chinatrust Whales”).

Evidence from the TabFact PostgreSQL database (public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season):

1) Confirming opponent names include Chinatrust Whales
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season ORDER BY opponent NULLS LAST;
- Result (excerpt of distinct opponents):
  • brother elephants
  • chinatrust whales
  • la new bears
  • macoto cobras

2) Specific game(s) where Pan Wei-Lun is the losing pitcher vs Chinatrust Whales
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%chinatrust%' AND opponent ILIKE '%whales%' AND loss ILIKE '%pan%wei%lun%';
- Result:
  • Date: 3 / 23 | Opponent: chinatrust whales | Score: 4 - 5 | Loss: pan wei - lun

Additional context from sample rows (shows naming pattern of the loss field):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss IS NOT NULL LIMIT 20;
- Sample results include:
  • 3 / 17 vs la new bears, score 4 - 5, loss: pan wei - lun
  • 3 / 22 vs chinatrust whales, score 7 - 9, loss: kao lung - wei
  • 3 / 23 vs chinatrust whales, score 4 - 5, loss: pan wei - lun

Assessment:
- There is at least one recorded game (2007 season) where Pan Wei-Lun took the loss against the Chinatrust Whales, directly supporting the claim.

Assumptions:
- “chinatrust whale” refers to the CPBL team “Chinatrust Whales” (plural) as listed in the data.
- The table reflects the Uni-President Lions’ 2007 season; verification is constrained to this season as that is the available data scope.
- The “loss” column records the losing pitcher’s name (consistent with the examples).
