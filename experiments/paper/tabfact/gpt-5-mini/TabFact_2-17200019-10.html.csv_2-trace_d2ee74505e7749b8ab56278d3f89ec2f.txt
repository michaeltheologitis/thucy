Claim interpreted: “Of the 4 players who play in the Belgian Cup, Jonathan Legear scored more goals than the other players combined.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact6), schema: public
- Available relevant table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season (columns: player, league, title playoff, super cup, total)

Step 1 — Inspect the available data
- Purpose: See if there is a Belgian Cup column and what goal data exist per player.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;
- Observations:
  - Columns present: league, title playoff, super cup, total.
  - There is no explicit “Belgian Cup” column in this dataset.
  - For Jonathan Legear: league = 5, title playoff = 1, super cup = 0, total = 7.

Step 2 — Identify non-league goal scorers in the column closest to a domestic cup
- Note: Since there is no “Belgian Cup” column, I treat “title playoff” as the closest available non-league domestic competition metric for this verification (see Assumptions below).
- Question: How many players have > 0 goals in “title playoff” and who are they?
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_positive_title_playoff
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
  WHERE "title playoff" > 0;
- Executed SQL (list players):
  SELECT player, "title playoff"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
  WHERE "title playoff" > 0
  ORDER BY "title playoff" DESC, player;
- Result:
  - Count: 1 player with > 0 in “title playoff”.
  - Player: jonathan legear — 1.

Step 3 — Compare Jonathan Legear’s “title playoff” goals to all others combined
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN lower(coalesce(player,'')) = 'jonathan legear' THEN "title playoff" ELSE 0 END) AS jonathan_legear_sum,
    SUM(CASE WHEN lower(coalesce(player,'')) <> 'jonathan legear' THEN "title playoff" ELSE 0 END) AS others_sum
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;
- Result:
  - Jonathan Legear “title playoff” goals: 1
  - All other players combined “title playoff” goals: 0

Findings with respect to the claim
- The dataset does not include an explicit “Belgian Cup” column or player appearance data, so we cannot verify “the 4 players who play in the Belgian Cup.”
- Under the reasonable mapping of “title playoff” as the closest available domestic knock-out competition field in this table, the comparative scoring part is supported: Jonathan Legear’s goals (1) exceed the combined goals of all other players (0) in that column.
- However, the premise that there are “4 players who play in the Belgian Cup” is not supported by the available data: there is no appearances field, and even counting scorers in “title playoff” yields only 1 scorer.

Conclusion
- The comparative statement about Legear scoring more than the others combined (in the closest available non-league competition field, “title playoff”) is supported by the data.
- The claim’s setup about “the 4 players who play in the Belgian Cup” is not supported by this dataset.

Assumptions
- Because the table has no explicit “Belgian Cup” column, I used the “title playoff” column as the nearest proxy for a domestic cup-like, non-league competition to evaluate the goal comparison portion.
- Player name matching was done case-insensitively (all names are stored lowercase in the table).
