Summary
Claim: "golden state , memphis , and new orleans all have the same attendance."
Verdict basis: Verified against the only accessible, authoritative dataset (TabFact > public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season), which contains game-level entries with a combined arena/attendance field.
Finding: The recorded attendance values for these teams in this table are not the same. Memphis has two different attendance values; New Orleans has a different one; Golden State has no numeric attendance recorded for its row.

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact), schema: public
- Candidate table with attendance: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (columns: game, date, team, location attendance, record)

Step 1 — Inspect the table to see representation of team and attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season LIMIT 20;
Returned key rows involving the teams of interest:
- game 78 | team: new orleans | location attendance: new orleans arena 17781
- game 79 | team: memphis | location attendance: fedexforum 15908
- game 81 | team: memphis | location attendance: us airways center 18422
- game 82 | team: golden state | location attendance: us airways center (no numeric value shown)

Step 2 — Extract numeric attendance and compare across the three teams
2a) Row-level extraction for the three teams
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "location attendance", NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'') AS attendance_digits
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE LOWER(team) IN ('golden state','memphis','new orleans')
ORDER BY team, game;
Returned rows:
- golden state | us airways center | NULL
- memphis | fedexforum 15908 | 15908
- memphis | us airways center 18422 | 18422
- new orleans | new orleans arena 17781 | 17781

2b) Distinct attendance values across these teams
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'') AS attendance_digits
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE LOWER(team) IN ('golden state','memphis','new orleans')
ORDER BY attendance_digits;
Returned values:
- 15908, 17781, 18422, NULL

2c) Count of distinct non-null attendance values
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'') ) AS distinct_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE LOWER(team) IN ('golden state','memphis','new orleans')
  AND NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'') IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- distinct_count: 3

Conclusion
- The attendance entries associated with these teams in the available dataset are not all the same. Memphis has 15908 and 18422; New Orleans has 17781; Golden State has no numeric attendance recorded in its row. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "Attendance" refers to the numeric audience count embedded at the end of the "location attendance" field in public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.
- Team matching is case-insensitive and uses the values found in the team column (e.g., 'golden state', 'memphis', 'new orleans').
- Only the accessible dataset (this specific table) was used; broader league-wide attendance datasets were not available in the current environment.
