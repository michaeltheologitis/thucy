Claim interpreted: The elector from Pisa was elevated in 1117 by Urban II (or Paschal II).

Data source explored: TabFact database (public schema). Table: papal_election_1119 with columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, elevator.

Evidence gathered:
1) Locate electors associated with Pisa
- Executed SQL:
SELECT elector, nationality, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator
FROM papal_election_1119
WHERE nationality ILIKE '%pisa%' OR nationality ILIKE '%pisan%' OR nationality ILIKE '%pisano%'
   OR "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%pisa%' OR "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%pisan%' OR "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%pisano%';
- Result:
  • elector: crisogono malcondini | nationality: pisa | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of s nicola in carcere | elevated: 1117 | elevator: paschal ii

2) Confirm how many Pisa-associated electors exist in this table
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pisa_count FROM public.papal_election_1119 WHERE nationality ILIKE '%pisa%';
- Result: pisa_count = 1

3) Show all rows (context)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.papal_election_1119;
- Relevant row for Pisa:
  • elector: crisogono malcondini | nationality: pisa | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of s nicola in carcere | elevated: 1117 | elevator: paschal ii

Conclusion:
- The sole elector from Pisa in this dataset is Crisogono Malcondini, who was elevated in 1117 by Paschal II. The alternative “Urban II” does not apply to this Pisa elector.

Assumptions made:
- “Elector from Pisa” refers to the entry with nationality listed as Pisa in the papal_election_1119 table (Crisogono Malcondini). The TabFact database is treated as authoritative per instructions.
