Claim to verify: “Proteus mirabilis have a positive Voges–Proskauer reading.”

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (Postgres). Exploration identified a relevant table: public.imvic with columns: species, indole, methyl red, voges - proskauer, citrate.

Evidence from database queries:
1) VP result lookup for Proteus mirabilis (including name variants):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT species, "voges - proskauer" FROM public.imvic WHERE species ILIKE '%mirabilis%';
- Result:
  species: proteus mirabilis | voges - proskauer: negative

2) Full IMViC profile for Proteus mirabilis (context):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT species, indole, "methyl red", "voges - proskauer", citrate
  FROM public.imvic
  WHERE species ILIKE '%Proteus mirabilis%';
- Result (one row):
  species: proteus mirabilis; indole: negative; methyl red: positive; voges - proskauer: negative; citrate: positive

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists Proteus mirabilis with a negative Voges–Proskauer (VP) result. This contradicts the claim that it is VP positive.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data; Proteus mirabilis is VP negative in the referenced dataset.

Assumptions:
- Species naming was matched case-insensitively and included possible abbreviations via ILIKE '%mirabilis%'.
- The public.imvic table is treated as authoritative for IMViC test results per the available data environment.
