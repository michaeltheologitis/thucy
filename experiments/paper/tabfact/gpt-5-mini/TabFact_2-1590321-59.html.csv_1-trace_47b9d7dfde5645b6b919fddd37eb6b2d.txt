Claim to verify: “during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160.”

How I interpreted the claim
- I interpreted “goal score” as the goals field in the available table of top association football goal scorers, and “during the year of 1950 through 1965” as players whose listed playing years overlap 1950–1965.

Data sources discovered
- I discovered one accessible data source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- SQL not required (tool returned structure directly)
- Table: public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country
  - Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), years (text), matches (bigint), goals (bigint)

Initial data sampling
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT rank, name, years, matches, goals
  FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country
  LIMIT 10;
- Result (10 rows):
  1) rank: 1, name: dudu georgescu, years: 1970 - 1986, matches: 370, goals: 252
  2) rank: 2, name: ionel danciulescu, years: 1993 - present, matches: 427, goals: 210
  3) rank: 3, name: rodion camataru, years: 1974 - 1989, matches: 377, goals: 198
  4) rank: 4, name: marin radu, years: 1974 - 1989, matches: 384, goals: 190
  5) rank: 5, name: ion oblemenco, years: 1964 - 1976, matches: 272, goals: 170
  6) rank: 5, name: florea dumitrache, years: 1966 - 1983, matches: 357, goals: 170
  7) rank: 7, name: mircea sandu, years: 1970 - 1987, matches: 407, goals: 167
  8) rank: 8, name: victor piturca, years: 1975 - 1989, matches: 301, goals: 166
  9) rank: 9, name: mihai adam, years: 1962 - 1976, matches: 353, goals: 160
  10) rank: 10, name: titus ozon, years: 1947 - 1964, matches: 270, goals: 157

Direct test: Players whose years include the 1950s/1960s and their goals
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, years, goals FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE years LIKE '%195%' OR years LIKE '%196%' ORDER BY goals DESC LIMIT 50;
- Results (ordered by goals DESC):
  - ion oblemenco — years: 1964 - 1976 — goals: 170
  - florea dumitrache — years: 1966 - 1983 — goals: 170
  - mihai adam — years: 1962 - 1976 — goals: 160
  - titus ozon — years: 1947 - 1964 — goals: 157

Aggregate check: Maximum goals among those rows
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(goals) AS max_goals
  FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country
  WHERE years LIKE '%195%' OR years LIKE '%196%';
- Result: max_goals = 170

Count of rows at or above 160 goals among those years
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, years, goals FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE (years LIKE '%195%' OR years LIKE '%196%') AND goals >= 160 ORDER BY goals DESC;
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE (years LIKE '%195%' OR years LIKE '%196%') AND goals >= 160;
- Results:
  - Names/goals:
    - ion oblemenco — 170 (1964 - 1976)
    - florea dumitrache — 170 (1966 - 1983)
    - mihai adam — 160 (1962 - 1976)
  - Count: 3

Assessment against the claim
- The claim asserts that during 1950–1965 “the goal score be less than 160.”
- Evidence shows that among players whose listed playing years overlap that era (roughly captured via years containing ‘195’ or ‘196’), the maximum goals value is 170, and there are three such players with goals ≥ 160. Therefore, the statement “less than 160” is contradicted by the data we have.

Important limitation noted
- The goals values in this table appear to be career totals, not goals restricted only to 1950–1965. Thus, while the overlap test identifies players active in or near that period, their goals values represent entire careers which often extend beyond 1965. Nonetheless, even under this dataset’s best available interpretation, the claim that the goal score is less than 160 is not supported: some overlapping players have totals of 160 and 170.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim as interpreted: there exist players overlapping the 1950–1965 window with goals equal to or exceeding 160, and the maximum among them is 170.

Assumptions made
- “Goal score” corresponds to the goals column (career goals) in the available table.
- “During the year of 1950 through 1965” was operationalized by selecting rows with years text containing ‘195’ or ‘196’ (a practical proxy for overlap with 1950s/1960s given the textual years format).
