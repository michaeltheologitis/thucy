Claim interpreted: Volumes 2, 4, and 5 each have 2 discs and 3 episodes.

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (columns: volume, discs, episodes, region 1, region 2, region 4)

Evidence query and results:
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes FROM public.my_info_table WHERE volume IN (2,4,5) ORDER BY volume;

Result:
- volume: 2, discs: 1, episodes: 4
- volume: 4, discs: 1, episodes: 4
- volume: 5, discs: 1, episodes: 4

Analysis:
- For volume 2: expected 2 discs and 3 episodes; data shows 1 disc and 4 episodes.
- For volume 4: expected 2 discs and 3 episodes; data shows 1 disc and 4 episodes.
- For volume 5: expected 2 discs and 3 episodes; data shows 1 disc and 4 episodes.
All three volumes contradict the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “volume’s 2, 4, and 5” refers to the numeric volume entries in public.my_info_table.
- The table contains one row per volume, with region information captured in separate columns rather than separate rows.
