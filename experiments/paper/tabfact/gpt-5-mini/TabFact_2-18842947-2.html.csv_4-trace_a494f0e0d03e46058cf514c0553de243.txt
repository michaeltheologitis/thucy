Claim interpreted: The Packers scored the fewest points (6) of any opponent in a game versus the Lions during the scoped data we can access.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (Postgres), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Step 1 — Identify Lions vs. Packers games in 1976
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, opponent AS raw_opponent, result AS raw_result
FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Green Bay%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Packers%'
ORDER BY week;

Evidence returned:
- Week 4 — october 3 , 1976 — opponent: green bay packers — result: l 24 - 14
- Week 8 — october 31 , 1976 — opponent: green bay packers — result: w 27 - 6

Interpretation: On October 31, 1976, the Lions beat the Packers 27–6, meaning the Packers scored 6 points in that game.

Step 2 — Determine the minimum opponent points across all Lions games in 1976
Parsing approach: Extract the two numeric scores from the result string. If result starts with 'w', the second score is the opponent's; if it starts with 'l', the first score is the opponent's.

Executed SQL (verify extraction of the two numbers):
SELECT week, result, regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)') AS arr
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
ORDER BY week;

Executed SQL (compute opponent_points for each game):
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, first_score, second_score,
 CASE WHEN lower(left(result,1))='w' THEN second_score WHEN lower(left(result,1))='l' THEN first_score ELSE NULL END AS opponent_points
FROM (
 SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
  (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[1]::int AS first_score,
  (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[2]::int AS second_score
 FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
) AS sub
ORDER BY week;

Executed SQL (find minimum opponent_points):
SELECT MIN(CASE WHEN lower(left(result,1))='w' THEN second_score WHEN lower(left(result,1))='l' THEN first_score END) AS min_opponent_points
FROM (
 SELECT result, (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[1]::int AS first_score,
        (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[2]::int AS second_score
 FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
) AS sub;

Result: min_opponent_points = 6

Executed SQL (list games with opponent_points = 6):
SELECT week, date, opponent, result
FROM (
 SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
  (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[1]::int AS first_score,
  (regexp_matches(result, '(\\d+)\\s*-\\s*(\\d+)'))[2]::int AS second_score
 FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
) AS t
WHERE CASE WHEN lower(left(result,1))='w' THEN second_score WHEN lower(left(result,1))='l' THEN first_score END = 6
ORDER BY week;

Evidence returned:
- Week 8 — october 31 , 1976 — green bay packers — w 27 - 6

Conclusion
- Within the 1976 Detroit Lions season, the fewest points scored by any opponent in a game against the Lions was 6, and that opponent was the Green Bay Packers (Week 8, 27–6).

Final assessment of the claim
- The claim is supported by the available data when interpreted as referring to the 1976 Lions season.

Assumptions
- Scope: The claim is interpreted to pertain to the 1976 Detroit Lions season (the only season available in the data). No inference is made beyond 1976.
- Parsing: In result strings, for 'w' entries the second number is the opponent’s score; for 'l' entries the first number is the opponent’s score.
