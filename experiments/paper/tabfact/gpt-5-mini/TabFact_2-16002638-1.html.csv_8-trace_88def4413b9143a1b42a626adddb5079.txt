Claim: “the Dundee Hurricanes do not win the same number of game in any of the season they play between 2003 and 2009.”

Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL, public.dundee_hurricanes table (columns: season, division, wins, losses, ties, "final position", notes).

Evidence step 1 — Retrieve seasons 2003–2009 with win totals:
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, wins, losses, ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season BETWEEN 2003 AND 2009 ORDER BY season ASC;
Results:
- 2003 — wins: 6, losses: 4, ties: 0
- 2004 — wins: 6, losses: 2, ties: 1
- 2005 — wins: 5, losses: 5, ties: 0
- 2006 — wins: 3, losses: 4, ties: 0
- 2007 — wins: 9, losses: 1, ties: 0
- 2008 — wins: 5, losses: 2, ties: 3
- 2009 — wins: 2, losses: 6, ties: 1

Evidence step 2 — Check for duplicate win totals within 2003–2009:
Executed SQL:
SELECT wins, COUNT(*) AS season_count, array_agg(season ORDER BY season) AS seasons
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
WHERE season BETWEEN 2003 AND 2009
GROUP BY wins
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY wins;
Results:
- wins: 5, season_count: 2, seasons: {2005,2008}
- wins: 6, season_count: 2, seasons: {2003,2004}

Conclusion: There are duplicate win totals (6 wins in 2003 and 2004; 5 wins in 2005 and 2008). Therefore, it is not true that the Dundee Hurricanes had unique win totals in every season from 2003 to 2009.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “between 2003 and 2009” inclusively.
- The public.dundee_hurricanes table comprehensively reflects the team’s seasons and records for those years.
