Claim: “kardinia park be 1 of 2 venue where the home team score be higher than the away team score.”

Conclusion: The data supports the claim. In the 1954 VFL season table, there are exactly two venues where the total home points exceed the total away points, and Kardinia Park is one of them.

Evidence from data (TabFact, public.t_1954_vfl_season):

1) Verify score format and sample rows
- SQL (executed):
SELECT venue, "home team score", "away team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 50;
- Sample returned rows:
  - {venue: kardinia park, home team score: "13.12 (90)", away team score: "7.6 (48)"}
  - {venue: victoria park, home team score: "12.16 (88)", away team score: "13.12 (90)"}
  - {venue: princes park, home team score: "10.16 (76)", away team score: "11.14 (80)"}
  - {venue: punt road oval, home team score: "10.18 (78)", away team score: "15.4 (94)"}
  - {venue: arden street oval, home team score: "9.14 (68)", away team score: "9.14 (68)"}
  - {venue: junction oval, home team score: "13.14 (92)", away team score: "9.15 (69)"}
(Interpretation: The integer in parentheses is the total points to aggregate.)

2) Totals by venue (sum of points in parentheses) and comparison
- SQL (executed):
SELECT venue,
       SUM(COALESCE(substring("home team score" FROM (strpos("home team score","(")+1) FOR (strpos("home team score",")") - strpos("home team score","(") - 1))::int,0)) AS total_home_points,
       SUM(COALESCE(substring("away team score" FROM (strpos("away team score","(")+1) FOR (strpos("away team score",")") - strpos("away team score","(") - 1))::int,0)) AS total_away_points,
       CASE WHEN SUM(COALESCE(substring("home team score" FROM (strpos("home team score","(")+1) FOR (strpos("home team score",")") - strpos("home team score","(") - 1))::int,0)) > SUM(COALESCE(substring("away team score" FROM (strpos("away team score","(")+1) FOR (strpos("away team score",")") - strpos("away team score","(") - 1))::int,0)) THEN true ELSE false END AS home_total_gt_away_total
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY venue;
- Returned (key results):
  - arden street oval: home 68, away 68 → false
  - junction oval: home 92, away 69 → true
  - kardinia park: home 90, away 48 → true
  - princes park: home 76, away 80 → false
  - punt road oval: home 78, away 94 → false
  - victoria park: home 88, away 90 → false

3) Identify and count venues where home totals > away totals
- SQL (executed):
SELECT venue,
       SUM((substring("home team score" from strpos("home team score","(")+1 for strpos("home team score",")") - strpos("home team score","(") -1))::int) AS total_home_points,
       SUM((substring("away team score" from strpos("away team score","(")+1 for strpos("away team score",")") - strpos("away team score","(") -1))::int) AS total_away_points
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
HAVING SUM((substring("home team score" from strpos("home team score","(")+1 for strpos("home team score",")") - strpos("home team score","(") -1))::int) > SUM((substring("away team score" from strpos("away team score","(")+1 for strpos("away team score",")") - strpos("away team score","(") -1))::int)
ORDER BY venue;
- Result rows:
  - junction oval (home 92, away 69)
  - kardinia park (home 90, away 48)

- SQL (executed) to count these venues:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (
  SELECT venue
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
  GROUP BY venue
  HAVING SUM((substring("home team score" from strpos("home team score","(")+1 for strpos("home team score",")") - strpos("home team score","(") -1))::int) > SUM((substring("away team score" from strpos("away team score","(")+1 for strpos("away team score",")") - strpos("away team score","(") -1))::int)
) t;
- Count returned: 2

Answer: Verified — Kardinia Park is one of exactly two venues where the total home team score exceeds the total away team score in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- “Score” refers to the total points shown in parentheses in the score strings (e.g., "13.12 (90)" → 90), and venue-level comparison uses the sum of these totals across all games at each venue in the table.
- The claim pertains specifically to the data in public.t_1954_vfl_season (1954 VFL season).
