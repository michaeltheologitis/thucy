Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact instance) with schema public. It contains table t_1996_pga_championship with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text), money (bigint).

What I checked
- Interpreted “earn” as the prize money recorded in the money column of t_1996_pga_championship.
- Interpreted “Mark Brook” as “Mark Brooks” (the name present in the table), and verified both names’ amounts, then computed the difference.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve Kenny Perry, Mark Brook, and Mark Brooks money values
SQL:
SELECT player, money FROM t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(player) IN ('kenny perry','mark brook','mark brooks');
Result:
- player: mark brooks, money: 430000
- player: kenny perry, money: 260000

2) Verify the exact player spellings in the table
SQL:
SELECT player, money FROM t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY player;
Result (excerpt):
- mark brooks — 430000
- kenny perry — 260000
(Note: No exact match for “Mark Brook”.)

3) Compute the difference (Kenny Perry minus Mark Brooks)
SQL:
SELECT
  (SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player='kenny perry') -
  (SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player='mark brooks') AS diff,
  (SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player='kenny perry') AS kenny_money,
  (SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player='mark brooks') AS mark_money;
Result:
- diff: -170000, kenny_money: 260000, mark_money: 430000

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (1996 PGA Championship results), Kenny Perry earned 260000 and Mark Brooks earned 430000. Kenny Perry did not earn 170000 more; he earned 170000 less than Mark Brooks.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1996 PGA Championship prize money (the only relevant dataset available here).
- “Earn” refers to the money column in that table.
- “Mark Brook” refers to “Mark Brooks,” the player present in the data.
