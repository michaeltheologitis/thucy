Summary
- I explored the available data source and found one table relevant to MMA fights: public.katsuya_inoue, which includes opponent and event fields.
- I queried this table to verify whether, at the event GCM - DOG 4, the listed opponent was Daisuke Hanazawa.

Evidence from data
1) Query to find fights at GCM - D.O.G. 4 (allowing minor punctuation/spacing variations):
SQL:
SELECT opponent, event
FROM public.katsuya_inoue
WHERE regexp_replace(lower(event), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g') = 'gcmdog4';

Result:
- opponent: daisuke hanazawa
  event: gcm - dog 4

Assessment
- The row shows that at the event “gcm - dog 4,” the opponent recorded in this dataset is “daisuke hanazawa.” This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the public.katsuya_inoue table.

Assumptions
- The dataset pertains to the fighter whose record is in public.katsuya_inoue (Katsuya Inoue). I interpret the claim as referring to this fighter’s opponent at the specified event.
