Claim to verify: “the college whose nickname be blue hose join in 1972 and be a member of the sac.”

Data sources explored
- Available source: postgres_tabfact27 (TabFact) — public schema.
- Only table present: north_state_conference, with columns: institution, location, founded, type, enrollment, nickname, joined, left, current conference.

What the data shows
1) Identify the college with nickname “Blue Hose” and its membership years and current conference.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM north_state_conference WHERE nickname ILIKE '%Blue Hose%';
Result:
- institution: presbyterian college
- location: clinton , south carolina
- founded: 1880
- type: private
- enrollment: 1300
- nickname: blue hose
- joined: 1965
- left: 1972
- current conference: big south (ncaa division i)

Interpretation: The “Blue Hose” are Presbyterian College. In this dataset, they joined in 1965 and left in 1972. Their current conference is listed as “big south (ncaa division i),” not SAC.

2) Direct check: Did any “Blue Hose” row show joined = 1972?
Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, nickname, joined, "left" FROM north_state_conference WHERE lower(nickname) = 'blue hose' AND joined = '1972';
Result: no rows returned.

Confirmation count:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM north_state_conference WHERE lower(nickname) = 'blue hose' AND joined = '1972';
Result: 0

Interpretation: The data does not support “joined in 1972” for the Blue Hose; instead, they left in 1972 (see Query 1).

3) Direct check: Is the “Blue Hose” institution a member of SAC (current conference contains ‘sac’)?
Executed SQL:
SELECT "institution", "nickname", "joined", "left", "current conference" FROM public.north_state_conference WHERE lower("nickname") = 'blue hose' AND lower("current conference") LIKE '%sac%';
Result: no rows returned.

Interpretation: The Blue Hose (Presbyterian College) are not listed as a current SAC member in this dataset.

4) Context: Which institutions are currently listed as SAC members in this table?
Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, nickname, "joined", "left", "current conference" FROM north_state_conference WHERE "current conference" ILIKE '%sac%';
Results (excerpt):
- anderson university | trojans | 1998 | 2010 | sac
- catawba college | indians | 1930 | 1989 | sac
- coker college | cobras | 1991 | 2013 | sac
- lenoirrhyne university | bears | 1930 , 1985 | 1974 , 1989 | sac
- mars hill college | lions | 1973 | 1975 | sac
- newberry college | wolves | 1961 | 1972 | sac
- queens university of charlotte | royals | 1995 | 2013 | sac

Interpretation: Several institutions are marked as SAC, but Presbyterian College (Blue Hose) is not among them; it is listed as Big South.

Conclusion
- True component: The college with the nickname “Blue Hose” is Presbyterian College.
- False components per the data:
  - “join in 1972”: The data shows joined = 1965 and left = 1972.
  - “be a member of the sac”: The data lists current conference = “big south (ncaa division i)”, not SAC.

Final assessment: The overall claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Blue Hose” refers to Presbyterian College, as identified in the dataset.
- “SAC” is interpreted as the South Atlantic Conference; rows with current conference containing “sac” are treated as SAC membership indicators.
- Case-insensitive comparisons were used for matching nickname and conference strings.
