Summary
- Data source discovery found a single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya, which includes cyclist, country, team, time, and uci points (text). This table records results and UCI points for the 2007 Volta a Catalunya.
- Within this dataset, the Russian riders present are Vladimir Karpets and Denis Menchov. Karpets has more UCI points than Menchov in this table.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect table contents
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya LIMIT 50;
Key returned rows:
- {country: "russia", cyclist: "vladimir karpets", team: "caisse d'epargne", time: "22h 21'05", uci points: "50"}
- {country: "russia", cyclist: "denis menchov", team: "rabobank", time: "+ 40", uci points: "40"}
(Other rows include riders from Australia, France, Spain, Netherlands, Slovenia.)

2) Distinct countries present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya ORDER BY country;
Result:
- australia, france, netherlands, russia, slovenia, spain

3) Rows for Denis Menchov
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE cyclist ILIKE '%denis menchov%';
Result:
- {country: "russia", cyclist: "denis menchov", team: "rabobank", time: "+ 40", uci points: "40"}

4) Russian riders and their UCI points
SQL:
SELECT cyclist, "uci points" FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE LOWER(country) = 'russia' ORDER BY cyclist;
Result:
- denis menchov — 40
- vladimir karpets — 50

5) Determine the maximum UCI points among Russian riders (treating points as numeric and ignoring non-numeric entries)
SQL:
SELECT cyclist, "uci points", ("uci points")::numeric AS uci_points_num
FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya
WHERE lower(country) = 'russia' AND "uci points" ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
ORDER BY uci_points_num DESC;
Result:
- vladimir karpets — 50
- denis menchov — 40

SQL:
WITH numeric_points AS (
  SELECT cyclist, ("uci points")::numeric AS uci_points_num
  FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya
  WHERE lower(country) = 'russia' AND "uci points" ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
)
SELECT cyclist, uci_points_num
FROM numeric_points
WHERE uci_points_num = (SELECT max(uci_points_num) FROM numeric_points);
Result:
- vladimir karpets — 50

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (2007 Volta a Catalunya), Denis Menchov did not score the most UCI points among Russian cyclists; Vladimir Karpets scored more (50 vs 40). This contradicts the claim within the scope of the accessible data.

Assumptions
- Because only the 2007 Volta a Catalunya table is available, the claim was evaluated against this dataset. No broader, career-wide, or season-wide UCI points data were accessible here.
- Country matching was case-insensitive.
- Non-numeric UCI points entries were ignored when computing maxima.
