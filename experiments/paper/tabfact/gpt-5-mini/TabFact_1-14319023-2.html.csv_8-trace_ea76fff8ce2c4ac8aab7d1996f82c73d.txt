Claim to verify:
- "In 2009, the girls' doubles were Anneke Feinya Agustin / Wenny Setiawati, and the mixed doubles were Wifqi Windarto / Debby Susanto."

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL) -> public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
  Columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles

Evidence 1 — Actual 2009 winners (girls doubles and mixed doubles):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "year", "girls doubles", "mixed doubles"
  FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
  WHERE "year" = 2009;
- Result:
  year: 2009; girls doubles: "ayu pratiwi anggi widia"; mixed doubles: "didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu"

Evidence 2 — Full record for 2009 for context:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
- Result:
  year: 2009
  boys singles: riyanto subagja
  girls singles: ana rovita
  boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita
  girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia
  mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu

Evidence 3 — Do the claimed pairs appear in any year (girls doubles side)?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
  WHERE "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Anneke Feinya Agustin%' OR "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Wenny Setiawati%'
  ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  2007 — girls doubles: "anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati"

Evidence 4 — Do the claimed pairs appear in any year (mixed doubles side)?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
  WHERE "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%Wifqi Windarto%' OR "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%Debby Susanto%'
  ORDER BY year;
- Results:
  2006 — mixed doubles: "danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto"
  2007 — mixed doubles: "wifqi windarto debby susanto"

Evidence 5 — Direct confirmation for 2007 (both categories):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, "girls doubles", "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2007;
- Result:
  2007 — girls doubles: "anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati"; mixed doubles: "wifqi windarto debby susanto"

Assessment:
- For 2009, the database shows girls doubles winners as "ayu pratiwi anggi widia" and mixed doubles winners as "didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu" — not the pairs in the claim.
- The claimed pairs actually correspond to 2007, not 2009, per the same authoritative table.

Conclusion:
- The claim is false for the year 2009. The named pairs won in 2007.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "girl double" as the "girls doubles" category and "mixed double" as "mixed doubles" within the Indonesian National Badminton Championships.
- Names are presented as stored in the dataset (concatenated pair names without punctuation).
