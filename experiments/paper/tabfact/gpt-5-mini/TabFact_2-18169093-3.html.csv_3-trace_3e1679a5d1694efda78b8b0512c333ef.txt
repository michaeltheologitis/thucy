Claim to verify: "in the 1981 open championship the win score be 72 , with 2 player tie for this score"

What the data shows
- The available data source contains a table named t_1981_open_championship with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text). This appears to represent leaderboard results for the 1981 Open Championship.

Key checks and evidence (with executed SQL)
1) Determine the winning (lowest) score and how many players achieved it.
SQL:
SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score FROM t_1981_open_championship;
Result: min_score = 70

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_min_score FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = (SELECT MIN(score) FROM t_1981_open_championship);
Result: count_min_score = 2

SQL:
SELECT place, player, score FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = (SELECT MIN(score) FROM t_1981_open_championship) ORDER BY place;
Results:
- place = "t1", player = "vicente fernã¡ndez", score = 70
- place = "t1", player = "nick job", score = 70

2) Check players who scored 72 and whether there were exactly two.
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_72 FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72;
Result: count_72 = 8

SQL:
SELECT player, place FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72 ORDER BY place;
Results (place — player):
- t9 — howard clark
- t9 — ben crenshaw
- t9 — david jagger
- t9 — mark james
- t9 — greg norman
- t9 — arnold palmer
- t9 — bill rogers
- t9 — sam torrance

3) Confirm relation to par for the winning score (context on scoring scale).
SQL:
SELECT player, score, "to par" FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 70;
Results:
- vicente fernã¡ndez — 70 — e
- nick job — 70 — e

Assessment against the claim
- "win score be 72": Not supported. The minimum (winning) score in this table is 70, not 72.
- "with 2 player tie for this score": Partly aligned only in the sense that two players tied for the winning score, but that score was 70, not 72. There were 8 players at 72.

Conclusion: The claim is incorrect. The data shows the winning score (lowest score) was 70 with two players tied at that score; eight players recorded 72.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted "win score" as the lowest score (place t1) in the t_1981_open_championship table. The table appears to represent a leaderboard (likely a round leaderboard) for the 1981 Open Championship, with "to par" indicating relation to par (70 is even, so par appears to be 70 in this context).
