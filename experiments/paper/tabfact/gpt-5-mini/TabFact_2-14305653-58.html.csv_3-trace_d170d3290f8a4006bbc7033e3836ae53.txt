Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game)

Step 1 — Understand available competition labels
- Purpose: Confirm how World Cup qualifiers are labeled in the data.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results ORDER BY "type of game";
- Results:
  1982 wcq; balkan cup; friendly
- Finding: World Cup qualifiers are labeled as "1982 wcq" in this dataset.

Step 2 — Retrieve all World Cup qualifier matches
- Purpose: See all 1982 World Cup qualifier matches and their scores.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, city, results
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq'
  ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  1) date: november 15 | opponent: italy | city: torino , italy | results: 0:2
  2) date: september 10 | opponent: luxembourg | city: luxembourg | results: 5:0
  3) date: september 27 | opponent: denmark | city: ljubljana | results: 2:1
- Finding: Yugoslavia played three 1982 WCQ matches; only vs Italy did they fail to score, losing 0:2.

Step 3 — Check across the entire table for all matches with 0 goals by Yugoslavia
- Purpose: Verify whether Yugoslavia failed to score only once overall in the dataset.
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_goal_matches_count
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE results LIKE '0:%';
- Result: 1

- Executed SQL (list those matches):
  SELECT date, opponent, "type of game", city, results
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE results LIKE '0:%'
  ORDER BY date;
- Result row:
  date: november 15 | opponent: italy | type of game: 1982 wcq | city: torino , italy | results: 0:2
- Finding: Across all recorded matches in this table, Yugoslavia failed to score only once, and it was the 0:2 loss to Italy in a World Cup qualifier.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: Yugoslavia failed to score only once in the matches recorded here, and that sole occurrence was a 0:2 defeat to Italy in a World Cup qualifying match.

Assumptions
- "World cup qualify match" corresponds to rows labeled "1982 wcq".
- "Failed to score only 1 time" refers to the scope of matches contained in this table.
- A failure to score is identified when the results text starts with "0:" (Yugoslavia’s goals are listed first).
