Data source exploration:
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: katrina_adams with columns: tournament (text), and yearly result columns including "1996".

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT tournament, "1996" FROM public.katrina_adams;
- Results (tournament — 1996):
  - australian open — a
  - french open — qf
  - wimbledon — qf
  - us open — 2r
  - grand slam tournaments — grand slam tournaments

Analysis:
- The 1996 entry for australian open is "a" and for french open is "qf". These values are not the same, so the results are different between the two tournaments in 1996.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the result in 1996 is different for the Australian Open and French Open is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "result" refers to the value recorded under the "1996" column for each tournament row in the katrina_adams table. The textual codes (e.g., "a", "qf") are taken as-is from the data without reinterpretation.
