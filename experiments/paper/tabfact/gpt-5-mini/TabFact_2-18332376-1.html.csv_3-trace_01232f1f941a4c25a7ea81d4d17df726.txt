Summary
Claim: In 1975, Jean‑François Bouvery (France) finished fourth and Anders Martinson (USA) finished second.
Finding: The 1975 results do not match this claim. Those exact placements (Martinson 2nd, Bouvery 4th) occur in 1991, not 1975.

Evidence from the data
1) 1975 results
SQL executed:
SELECT year, first, second, third, fourth FROM public.cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 1975;
Result:
- year: 1975
- first: john owings usa
- second: julian martin usa
- third: john - patrick millow france
- fourth: roe van boskirk usa
Interpretation: Neither Anders Martinson nor Jean‑François Bouvery appears in 1975; second place is “julian martin usa,” and fourth place is “roe van boskirk usa.”

2) Search for “Martinson” across all years/placements
SQL executed:
SELECT year, 'first' AS placement, first AS name
FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE first ILIKE '%martinson%'
UNION ALL
SELECT year, 'second' AS placement, second AS name
FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE second ILIKE '%martinson%'
UNION ALL
SELECT year, 'third' AS placement, third AS name
FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE third ILIKE '%martinson%'
UNION ALL
SELECT year, 'fourth' AS placement, fourth AS name
FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE fourth ILIKE '%martinson%'
ORDER BY year;
Result:
- year: 1991, placement: second, name: "anders martinson usa"
Interpretation: Anders Martinson appears as second place in 1991, not 1975.

3) Search for “Bouvery” across all years/placements
SQL executed:
SELECT year, first, second, third, fourth,
  (lower(first) LIKE '%bouvery%') AS first_has,
  (lower(second) LIKE '%bouvery%') AS second_has,
  (lower(third) LIKE '%bouvery%') AS third_has,
  (lower(fourth) LIKE '%bouvery%') AS fourth_has
FROM public.cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE lower(first) LIKE '%bouvery%'
   OR lower(second) LIKE '%bouvery%'
   OR lower(third) LIKE '%bouvery%'
   OR lower(fourth) LIKE '%bouvery%'
ORDER BY year;
Result:
- year: 1991
  - first: "ilya itin russia"
  - second: "anders martinson usa"
  - third: "markus pawlik germany"
  - fourth: "jean - françois bouvery france"
  - first_has: false, second_has: false, third_has: false, fourth_has: true
Interpretation: Jean‑François Bouvery appears only once, as fourth in 1991.

4) Direct retrieval of 1991 results for completeness
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 1991;
Result:
- year: 1991
- first: ilya itin russia
- second: anders martinson usa
- third: markus pawlik germany
- fourth: jean - françois bouvery france

Conclusion
The claim is incorrect for the year 1975. In 1975, second place was Julian Martin (USA) and fourth place was Roe Van Boskirk (USA). The pairing “Anders Martinson (USA) second” and “Jean‑François Bouvery (France) fourth” occurred in 1991, not 1975.

Assumptions
- Based on the schema and values, I interpret the table as recording top four placements of the Cleveland International Piano Competition by year. The verification is performed within this data context.
