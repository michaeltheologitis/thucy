Summary
- Claim: “The TV series Dexter has more than a dozen episodes in its third season.”
- Finding: The available data does not support this. The Dexter season 3 table shows 10 episode records, with the highest season episode number being 11. There is no evidence of more than 12 episodes.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data sources: PostgreSQL (TabFact), schema: public.

Schema exploration
- Table identified: public.dexter_season_3 — Episode-level data for Dexter (season 3). Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total row count (episodes present in the table)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.dexter_season_3;
- Result: count = 10

2) Maximum value of "no in season" (highest episode number within the season)
- SQL: SELECT MAX("no in season") AS max_no_in_season FROM public.dexter_season_3;
- Result: max_no_in_season = 11

3) Episode titles ordered by season number
- SQL: SELECT "no in season", title FROM public.dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season";
- Result rows (ordered):
  - 1: our father
  - 2: finding freebo
  - 3: the lion sleeps tonight
  - 4: all in the family
  - 5: turning biminese
  - 6: sá se puede
  - 7: easy as pie
  - 8: the damage a man can do
  - 10: go your own way
  - 11: i had a dream

4) Distinct season numbers summary
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "no in season") AS distinct_eps, MIN("no in season") AS min_no, MAX("no in season") AS max_no FROM public.dexter_season_3;
- Result: distinct_eps = 10, min_no = 1, max_no = 11

5) Sorted distinct season numbers
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "no in season" AS no_in_season FROM public.dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season";
- Result: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 (episode 9 is not present)

Conclusion
- The data shows at most 11 as the highest season episode number and only 10 episode rows present. There is no support for “more than a dozen” (>12) episodes in Dexter season 3.

Assumptions and notes
- Assumed the public.dexter_season_3 table is authoritative for counting season 3 episodes. While episode number 9 is missing from the dataset, even the maximum observed season episode number (11) is still not greater than 12. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.
