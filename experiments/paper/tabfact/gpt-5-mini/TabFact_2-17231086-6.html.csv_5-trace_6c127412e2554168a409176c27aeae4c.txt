Claim interpreted: “Three of the people tied for fifth place are from the United States.”

Data source consulted: TabFact database, table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf (authoritative for this verification).

Evidence from the data

1) Inspect all leaderboard rows and tie notation
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf;

Result rows (place | player | country | score):
1 | curtis strange | united states | 71 + 64 + 73 + 70 = 278
t2 | chip beck | united states | 71 + 69 + 71 + 68 = 279
t2 | mark mccumber | united states | 70 + 68 + 72 + 69 = 279
t2 | ian woosnam | wales | 70 + 68 + 73 + 68 = 279
5 | brian claar | united states | 71 + 72 + 68 + 69 = 280
t6 | masashi ozaki | japan | 70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281
t6 | scott simpson | united states | 67 + 70 + 69 + 75 = 281
8 | peter jacobsen | united states | 71 + 70 + 71 + 70 = 282
t9 | paul azinger | united states | 71 + 72 + 70 + 70 = 283
t9 | hubert green | united states | 69 + 72 + 74 + 68 = 283
t9 | tom kite | united states | 67 + 69 + 69 + 78 = 283
t9 | josé maría olazábal | spain | 69 + 72 + 70 + 72 = 283

Observation: Fifth place appears as “5” (single entrant: Brian Claar). Ties elsewhere are denoted by a leading “t” (e.g., t2, t6, t9). There is no “t5” entry.

2) Confirm distinct place values
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;

Result:
1
5
8
t2
t6
t9

Observation: No “t5” exists; fifth place is a solo “5”.

3) Count entries at fifth place and how many are from the United States
3a) Distribution of place values
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY cnt DESC, place;

Result:
[{"place":"t9","cnt":4},{"place":"t2","cnt":3},{"place":"t6","cnt":2},{"place":"1","cnt":1},{"place":"5","cnt":1},{"place":"8","cnt":1}]

3b) Count all rows corresponding to fifth place (including any tie notation)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_5th
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE place ~* '^t?5(th)?$';

Result:
[{"total_5th":1}]

3c) Identify the canonical country label for the United States
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY country;

Result:
[{"country":"japan"},{"country":"spain"},{"country":"united states"},{"country":"wales"}]

3d) Count how many fifth-place entries are from the United States
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS us_5th
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE place ~* '^t?5(th)?$'
  AND country = 'united states';

Result:
[{"us_5th":1}]

Findings
- There is exactly one fifth-place finisher, not a tie.
- That single fifth-place finisher (Brian Claar) is from the United States.
- Therefore, the statement that “3 of the people tie for fifth place … [and are] from the United States” is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate for this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the standings captured in the table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf (1989 U.S. Open Golf results).
- “Tie for fifth” would appear as a place value like “t5” if it existed; none is present.
- “United States” is matched exactly as stored: 'united states'.
