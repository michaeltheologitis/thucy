Claim to verify: “for the class hercules, with wheel arrangement 2 - 4 - 0, the manufacturer be nine elm work.”

Data sources consulted
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway (columns: class, wheel arrangement, manufacturer, year made, quantity made, quantity preserved, year (s) withdrawn)

Evidence
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT class, "wheel arrangement", manufacturer FROM locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE class ILIKE '%Hercules%';

- Result returned by the database:
  - class: hercules
  - wheel arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0
  - manufacturer: nine elms works

Assessment
- Class: The table contains an entry “hercules” (case-insensitive match to “Hercules”). Supported.
- Wheel arrangement: Listed as “2 - 4 - 0,” matching the claim’s “2 - 4 - 0.” Supported.
- Manufacturer: Listed as “nine elms works.” The claim states “nine elm work.” This is a minor naming/spelling deviation; the authoritative entry is “Nine Elms Works.” Substantively supported.

Conclusion
The database directly supports that the Hercules class with wheel arrangement 2-4-0 was manufactured by Nine Elms Works. The claim’s manufacturer wording differs slightly (pluralization/spelling), but the substance matches the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “hercules” as the class name exactly as stored in the table (case-insensitive).
- Treated “2 - 4 - 0” and “2-4-0” as equivalent formatting.
- Treated “nine elm work” as an intended reference to “Nine Elms Works,” the exact manufacturer name in the data.
