Claim to verify: "the 49ers lose 8 of the game in the 1947 season"

Conclusion: The San Francisco 49ers did not lose 8 games in 1947; they lost 4 games and finished 8–4–2.

Evidence from data

1) Full game-by-game results (to inspect results encoding and final record progression)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY week;
Key returned rows (week, opponent, result):
- Losses appear in weeks 4, 8, 10, 11 (result = 'l'). The final row (week 14) shows record = "8 - 4 - 2".

2) Count wins, losses, ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season GROUP BY result ORDER BY result;
Returned:
- l | 4
- t | 2
- w | 8
Interpretation: 8 wins, 4 losses, 2 ties.

3) Final record string from last week
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, record FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY week DESC LIMIT 1;
Returned:
- week = 14, record = "8 - 4 - 2"

Assessment of the claim
- The claim implies the 49ers lost 8 games in the 1947 season. The verified data shows only 4 losses. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the data and is inaccurate.

Assumptions made
- "49ers" refers to the San Francisco 49ers in the 1947 AAFC season.
- The phrase "lose 8 of the game" is interpreted as "lost 8 games."
- The table public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season is authoritative for the 1947 season results.
