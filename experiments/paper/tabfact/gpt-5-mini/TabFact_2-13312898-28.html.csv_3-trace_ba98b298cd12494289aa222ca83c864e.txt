Conclusion
Verified: In the Indianapolis Colts draft history dataset available, there are no players with the position labeled “running back” who were selected after the 10th round.

What I checked and why
- I inspected the only available dataset (public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history) for player positions and draft rounds to see if any entries with position = “running back” had round > 10.
- I also confirmed that there are picks after round 10 in the dataset (to ensure the condition is meaningful) and listed them to verify none were “running back.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered data asset: postgres_tabfact18 (public schema)
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history

Schema details used
- Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct positions and counts (to understand position labels)
SQL:
SELECT position, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result (excerpt):
- running back — 2
- fullback — 1
(plus other positions)

2) List of all “running back” picks with their rounds
SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE lower(position) = 'running back'
ORDER BY round ASC, overall ASC;
Results:
- round: 1, pick: 5, overall: 5, name: curtis dickey, position: running back, college: texas a&m
- round: 9, pick: 6, overall: 227, name: mark bright, position: running back, college: temple
Observation: The latest round among “running back” entries is round 9 (not after round 10).

3) Are there any picks after the 10th round at all?
SQL:
SELECT MIN(round) AS min_round, MAX(round) AS max_round FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history;
Result: min_round = 1, max_round = 12

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS picks_after_round_10
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE round > 10;
Result: picks_after_round_10 = 3

SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE round > 10
ORDER BY round, pick;
Results:
- round = 11, pick = 3, overall = 280, name = ed whitley, position = tight end
- round = 12, pick = 6, overall = 311, name = randy bielski, position = placekicker
- round = 12, pick = 19, overall = 324, name = marvin sims, position = fullback
Observation: No “running back” appears among picks after round 10.

4) Additional check for “back”-type positions (to ensure no mislabeled RBs)
SQL:
SELECT round, name, position
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE position ILIKE '%back%'
ORDER BY round ASC;
Results:
- round: 1, name: curtis dickey, position: running back
- round: 1, name: derrick hatchett, position: cornerback
- round: 9, name: mark bright, position: running back
- round: 12, name: marvin sims, position: fullback
Observation: The only “back” after round 10 is a fullback (not running back).

Final assessment
- The dataset contains no entries where position = “running back” and round > 10. Therefore, the claim holds true within the available data.

Assumptions
- “Running back position” was interpreted as entries with position exactly labeled “running back” (case-insensitive). The dataset distinguishes “fullback” separately, and I did not treat it as “running back.”
- The claim is evaluated against the available Indianapolis Colts draft history table only, which is the sole accessible data source.
