Claim interpreted: The user asserts that champion Jenny Shin received a $14,000 winner's share when she won.

Data source explored: TabFact database, table public.northeast_delta_dental_international, which contains columns: year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, and winner 's share.

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve Jenny Shin's record from the tournament table
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, country, score, purse, "winner 's share" FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE champion ILIKE '%Jenny Shin%';
- Result:
  • year: 2010
  • champion: jenny shin
  • country: united states
  • score: 205 (11)
  • purse: 110000
  • winner's share: 15400

2) Check for any Jenny Shin record with a $14,000 winner's share
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE champion = 'Jenny Shin' AND "winner 's share" = 14000;
- Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion: In the Northeast Delta Dental International (2010), Jenny Shin's winner's share was $15,400, not $14,000. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to Jenny Shin's winner's share for the Northeast Delta Dental International event recorded in the available table. No other Jenny Shin wins are present in this dataset.
