Claim to verify: “more than 100 game be play for the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy.”

Data sources checked:
- postgres_tabfact15, schema public, table public.my_info_table (columns: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, series record)

Evidence collected:
1) Identify any series whose trophy references “sawhorse” or “dollar”
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE trophy ILIKE '%sawhorse%' OR trophy ILIKE '%dollar%';
Result:
- match_count: 1

2) Retrieve the matching series details and extract a numeric games played value
SQL executed:
SELECT teams, name, trophy, "first met", "games played", "series record",
       regexp_replace("games played", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS games_played_digits,
       NULLIF(regexp_replace("games played", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS games_played_num
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE trophy ILIKE '%sawhorse%' OR trophy ILIKE '%dollar%';
Results (single row):
- teams: dartmouth - princeton
- trophy: sawhorse dollar
- games played: 90 games
- series record: 43 - 43 - 4
- games_played_num: 90

Assessment:
- The only series in the data associated with “sawhorse dollar” has 90 games played. This is not more than 100.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data. According to the table, the series with the Sawhorse Dollar trophy has 90 games played, which is fewer than 100.

Assumptions:
- “the series with the sawhorse dollar trophy” refers to the unique row where trophy = “sawhorse dollar” in public.my_info_table. Matching was done case-insensitively and by substring to ensure we captured the intended entry.
