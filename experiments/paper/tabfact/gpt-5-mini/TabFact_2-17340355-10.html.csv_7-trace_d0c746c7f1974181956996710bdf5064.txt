Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to identify relevant tables containing games, venues, and dates.
- Queried the only relevant table (public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season) for entries mentioning the arenas “FedExForum” (Memphis) and “Target Center” (Minnesota), then compared the game order and dates.

What the data shows
- The Phoenix Suns’ 2008–09 season table contains exactly two entries mentioning these arenas. The game at FedExForum is listed as game 79 on “april 10” vs. Memphis; the game at Target Center is listed as game 80 on “april 11” vs. Minnesota. Therefore, the FedExForum game occurred before the Target Center game.

Executed SQL and results
1) Query to find rows mentioning the two arenas (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE '%fedexforum%'
   OR lower("location attendance") LIKE '%target center%'
ORDER BY game ASC;
Results:
- game: 79, date: april 10, team: memphis, location attendance: fedexforum 15908
- game: 80, date: april 11, team: minnesota, location attendance: target center 18478

2) Expanded query to also catch a possible “FedEx Forum” spelling variant:
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE LOWER("location attendance") LIKE '%fedexforum%'
   OR LOWER("location attendance") LIKE '%fedex forum%'
   OR LOWER("location attendance") LIKE '%target center%'
ORDER BY game;
Results (same as above):
- game: 79, date: april 10, team: memphis, location attendance: fedexforum 15908
- game: 80, date: april 11, team: minnesota, location attendance: target center 18478

Conclusion
- Based on the only available authoritative dataset (2008–09 Phoenix Suns season), the game at FedExForum took place before the game at the Target Center, not after.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the accessible dataset (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season), as no broader league-wide or multi-season data is available in the connected data sources.
- “Took place after” is evaluated by the season’s chronological game number and corroborated by the listed dates in the table.
