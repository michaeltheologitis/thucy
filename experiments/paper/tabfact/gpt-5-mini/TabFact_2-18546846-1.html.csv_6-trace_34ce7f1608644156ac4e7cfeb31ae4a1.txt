Summary of approach:
- I first explored the available data sources and found a single relevant table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season, which lists the San Francisco 49ers’ 1947 AAFC season by week (date, opponent, result, score, running record).
- I then queried this table to identify the last game and its opponent, and to check where the Brooklyn Dodgers appear on that season’s schedule.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Determine the last game by week number
SQL:
SELECT MAX(week) AS max_week FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;
Result:
[{"max_week":14}]

2) Retrieve the last game’s details (week = 14)
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = (SELECT MAX(week) FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season);
Result:
[{"date":"december 7 , 1947","opponent":"buffalo bills","record":"8 - 4 - 2","result":"t","score":"21 - 21","week":14}]

3) Check all instances of “Brooklyn Dodgers” in the season
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'brooklyn dodgers' OR LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%brooklyn%';
Result:
[{"date":"august 31 , 1947","opponent":"brooklyn dodgers","week":1},{"date":"november 27 , 1947","opponent":"brooklyn dodgers","week":13}]

Findings:
- The last game of the 1947 season (week 14) was against the Buffalo Bills, ending in a 21-21 tie.
- The Brooklyn Dodgers appeared on the schedule in weeks 1 and 13, not in the last week.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the 49ers’ last opponent of the season was the Brooklyn Dodgers is not supported by the available data for the 1947 season; the last opponent was the Buffalo Bills.

Assumptions:
- “Last opponent of the season” is interpreted using the only available dataset (the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season) and ordered by the highest week number.
- “Brooklyn Dodger” is interpreted as the Brooklyn Dodgers (AAFC) team name variant referenced in the table.
