Claim to verify: “arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.”

Summary of finding
- The earliest broadcast date in the dataset is May 10, 2010 for the episode “おまえが欲しい” (romanized: “omae ga hosii”) with a rating of 22.4%.
- “arienai kisu” has a rating of 19.2%.
- The difference is 22.4% − 19.2% = 3.2 percentage points.
- If “3.2% less” is interpreted as percentage points (common when discussing ratings expressed in percent), the claim is supported by the data. The relative percent difference, however, is ~14.29%.

B) Identify the earliest broadcast date
SQL executed:
SELECT "broadcast date", to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY') AS dt
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY dt
LIMIT 1;
Result:
{ "broadcast date": "may 10 , 2010", "dt": "2010-05-10T00:00:00Z" }

C) Get the earliest-date episode’s details
SQL executed:
SELECT "episode title","romanized title","broadcast date","ratings"
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY') = (
  SELECT min(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY')) FROM tsuki_no_koibito
);
Result:
{ "broadcast date": "may 10 , 2010", "episode title": "おまえが欲しい", "ratings": "22.4%", "romanized title": "omae ga hosii" }

D) Get “arienai kisu” episode’s details
SQL executed:
SELECT "episode title","romanized title","broadcast date","ratings"
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE lower("romanized title") = 'arienai kisu';
Result:
{ "broadcast date": "may 17 , 2010", "episode title": "ありえないキス", "ratings": "19.2%", "romanized title": "arienai kisu" }

E) Compute numeric differences
SQL executed:
WITH ar AS (
  SELECT replace("ratings", '%', '')::numeric AS ar_r
  FROM tsuki_no_koibito
  WHERE lower("romanized title") = 'arienai kisu'
), ear AS (
  SELECT replace("ratings", '%', '')::numeric AS er_r
  FROM tsuki_no_koibito
  WHERE to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY') = (
    SELECT min(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ' ')), 'Month DD YYYY')) FROM tsuki_no_koibito
  )
)
SELECT (SELECT ar_r FROM ar) AS arienai_rating, (SELECT er_r FROM ear) AS earliest_rating,
       ((SELECT er_r FROM ear) - (SELECT ar_r FROM ar)) AS diff_percentage_points,
       (((SELECT er_r FROM ear) - (SELECT ar_r FROM ar)) / (SELECT er_r FROM ear) * 100) AS relative_percent_difference;
Result:
{ "arienai_rating": 19.2, "diff_percentage_points": 3.2, "earliest_rating": 22.4, "relative_percent_difference": 14.28571428571428571400 }

Conclusion
- The data shows that “arienai kisu” has a rating 3.2 percentage points lower than the earliest-broadcast episode (22.4% vs 19.2%). Under the common “percentage points” interpretation of “3.2% less rating,” the claim is supported.
- Note: If interpreted as a relative percent difference, the reduction is about 14.29%, not 3.2%.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “3.2% less rating” to mean 3.2 percentage points less, given that ratings are expressed as percentages in the data and such comparisons are typically made in percentage points.
- Broadcast dates were parsed by normalizing strings like “may 10 , 2010” to a standard format before date conversion.
