Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that episode number 53 in the relevant series is directed by Paul Holahan. Given the available data source (a table of White Collar episodes), I verify whether White Collar episode #53 is directed by Paul Holahan.

Evidence from data:
- Lookup of episode with no in series = 53
  - Result: title = "compromising positions"; directed by = "paul holahan"; no in season = 7
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT "title", "directed by", "no in season", "no in series" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 53;

- Check the presence of Paul Holahan in the directed by field
  - Result: distinct matching value = "paul holahan"
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT DISTINCT "directed by" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%holahan%';

- Uniqueness of episode number 53
  - Result: count = 1 (only one row with "no in series" = 53)
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 53;

Conclusion:
- The data shows that White Collar episode number 53 is directed by Paul Holahan. Therefore, the claim (interpreted as "episode no. 53 is directed by Paul Holahan") is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- The relevant series is White Collar, as this is the only available series dataset in the connected data source.
- The phrase "be direct" in the user message is interpreted as "be directed" (i.e., a grammatical/typographical omission), rather than the name of a different series, which is not present in the available data.
