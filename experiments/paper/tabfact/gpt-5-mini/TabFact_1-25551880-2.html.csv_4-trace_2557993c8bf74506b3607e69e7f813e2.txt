Claim interpreted: “Mark Cavendish [is] the only person to win 2 consecutive stages.” Given the available data, I evaluate this within the 2010 Vuelta a España (the only accessible race dataset).

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: postgres_tabfact12 (TabFact instance)
- Public schema tables: t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a (contains per-stage winners and classifications for the 2010 Vuelta a España)

Evidence 1: Stage winners in order
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, winner FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a ORDER BY stage;
Key results (excerpt):
- Stage 12 — mark cavendish
- Stage 13 — mark cavendish
- Stage 18 — mark cavendish
Other stage winners are all different from their immediately preceding stages. This shows Cavendish won both stage 12 and 13, i.e., two consecutive stages.

Evidence 2: Identify consecutive-stage winner pairs
SQL executed:
SELECT a.stage AS start_stage, a.stage+1 AS next_stage, a.winner
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a a
JOIN public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a b ON b.stage = a.stage + 1 AND a.winner = b.winner
ORDER BY a.stage;
Result:
- Starting stage: 12 (stages 12 and 13); Winner: mark cavendish
Only one consecutive pair exists, and the winner is Mark Cavendish.

Evidence 3: Count consecutive-stage pairs by winner
SQL executed:
SELECT t1.winner, COUNT(*) AS consecutive_count
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a t1
JOIN public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a t2
  ON t1.stage + 1 = t2.stage
  AND t1.winner = t2.winner
GROUP BY t1.winner
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0
ORDER BY consecutive_count DESC, t1.winner;
Result:
- mark cavendish — consecutive_count = 1
No other winner appears with a consecutive-stage pair.

Conclusion
Within the 2010 Vuelta a España dataset, Mark Cavendish is the only rider who won two consecutive stages (Stages 12 and 13). The data contains no other instances of back-to-back stage wins by any other person.

Assumptions and scope
- The claim is evaluated for the 2010 Vuelta a España because this is the only event covered by the available dataset.
- “Consecutive stages” means adjacent stage numbers (N and N+1).
- “Person” excludes the team time trial winner listed as “team htc - columbia” on Stage 1. This team does not form a consecutive winner pair in any case.
- This verification does not generalize to other years or races (e.g., Tour de France, Giro) beyond the provided data.
