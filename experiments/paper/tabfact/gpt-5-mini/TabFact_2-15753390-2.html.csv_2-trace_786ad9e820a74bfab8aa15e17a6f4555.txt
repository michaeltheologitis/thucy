Overview of data environment
- Data source discovered: postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact) database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt with columns: place (bigint), rider (text), country (text), machine (text), speed (text), time (text), points (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Locate the rider entry for Roger Dutton / Tony Wright and see their points
SQL executed:
SELECT place, rider, points FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt WHERE rider ILIKE '%Dutton%' OR rider ILIKE '%Wright%';
Result:
- place: 8, rider: roger dutton / tony wright, points: 3

2) Confirm how many rows exist for exactly this rider string (case-insensitive) and compute their minimum points
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt WHERE lower(rider) = 'roger dutton / tony wright';
Result:
- cnt = 1

SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(points) AS min_points FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt WHERE lower(rider) = 'roger dutton / tony wright';
Result:
- min_points = 3

Conclusion
- The data show one entry for the rider pair “roger dutton / tony wright” with points = 3. Therefore, the fewest points they received in this dataset is 3, not 2.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the riders recorded in the public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt table.
- Matching was performed case-insensitively on the exact rider string “roger dutton / tony wright.” If alternate spellings/formatting exist elsewhere, they are not present in this table.
