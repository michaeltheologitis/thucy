Summary of verification
- I explored the available data sources and found a single relevant table: public.memorial_van_damme in the TabFact PostgreSQL database, which appears to store meeting records for the AG Memorial Van Damme meet.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Broad search for any 400 m-related entries
SQL executed:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE '%400%';
Result rows:
- {"event":"400 m","record":"48.83","athlete":"sanya richards","nationality":"united states","date":"4 september 2009"}
- {"event":"400 m hurdles","record":"53.43","athlete":"nezha bidouane","nationality":"morocco","date":"28 august 1998"}

2) Exact match for the flat 400 m event
SQL executed:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event = '400 m';
Result row:
- {"event":"400 m","record":"48.83","athlete":"sanya richards","nationality":"united states","date":"4 september 2009"}

3) Confirm uniqueness of the 400 m entry
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_400m FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event = '400 m';
Result:
- count_400m: 1

Interpretation
- The dataset records that the 400 m meeting record at the Memorial Van Damme was 48.83, set on 4 September 2009 by Sanya Richards (United States). The phrasing “4th of Sep 2009” matches “4 September 2009,” and “48.83s” matches the recorded time “48.83.”

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “the record for the 400 m event” is interpreted as the Memorial Van Damme meeting record for the flat 400 m (not a world record).
