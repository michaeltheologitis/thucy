Claim interpreted: The user asserts that (a) Game 4 ("game 4.0") occurred on April 25 and (b) the series score was 1–4 on that date.

What I checked and found
1) Confirm the relevant table structure
- SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, ordinal_position
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (abridged): columns include game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), series (text). This confirms the table contains per-game records with dates and series status.

2) Verify the details for Game 4
- SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, series
  FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  WHERE game = 4;
- Result:
  game: 4
  date: april 25
  team: dallas
  score: l 90 - 99 (ot)
  series: 1 - 3
- Interpretation: Game 4 was on April 25, and the series standing after that game was 1–3 (Spurs trailing), not 1–4.

3) Cross-check all April dates to ensure correct matching
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date
  FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%april%' OR date ILIKE '%apr%';
- Result: april 18, april 20, april 23, april 25, april 28.

4) Directly find the April 25 row
- SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, series
  FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%april 25%';
- Result:
  game: 4
  date: april 25
  team: dallas
  score: l 90 - 99 (ot)
  series: 1 - 3

5) Find when the series was 1–4
- SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  WHERE series = '1 - 4' OR series LIKE '%1 - 4%' OR series ~ '1\s*[-–—]\s*4';
- Result:
  date: april 28, game: 5, team: dallas, score: l 93 - 106 (ot), series: 1 - 4
- Interpretation: The series became 1–4 on April 28 (after Game 5), not April 25.

Conclusion
- True: Game 4 took place on April 25.
- False: The series was not 1–4 on April 25; it was 1–3. The series reached 1–4 on April 28 (Game 5).

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season (the only available authoritative dataset).
- “game 4.0” is interpreted as Game 4.
- “series 1 – 4” refers to the “series” field in the table, which captures series standing after each game.
- The date column is textual, and matching is case-insensitive for month names.
