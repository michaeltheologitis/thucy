Claim to verify: "mark cockerell finish with a worse score than partice macrez"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
- Columns: rank, name, nation, sp + fs, points, places

Schema evidence (tool: schema_query):
- Database: TabFact; Schema: public; Table: t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships with columns rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), sp + fs (bigint), points (double precision), places (double precision). No primary/foreign keys.

Targeted data retrieval (tool: nl_query_traceable):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, rank, points, places
  FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Cockerell%' OR name ILIKE '%Macrez%';
- Results:
  - mark cockerell — rank: 1, points: 172.42, places: 11
  - patrice macrez — rank: 7, points: 151.76, places: 71

Analysis:
- If "score" refers to points: Mark Cockerell has 172.42 vs Patrice Macrez’s 151.76. Higher points indicate a better score; therefore, Cockerell did not finish with a worse score—he finished better.
- Cross-checking with other outcome measures:
  - Rank: Cockerell 1 vs Macrez 7 (lower rank is better) → Cockerell better.
  - Places: Cockerell 11 vs Macrez 71 (lower is better) → Cockerell better.

Conclusion: The data contradict the claim. Mark Cockerell did not finish with a worse score than Patrice Macrez; he finished ahead with a better score.

Assumptions made:
- "partice macrez" is interpreted as "Patrice Macrez" (case-insensitive matching used).
- "score" is primarily interpreted as the points column; however, rank and places also support the same conclusion.
