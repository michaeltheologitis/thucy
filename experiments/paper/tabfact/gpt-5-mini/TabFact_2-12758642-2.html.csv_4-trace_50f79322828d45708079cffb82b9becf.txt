Claim to verify: “daisuke hanazawa be the opponent at gcm - dog 4 in chiba , japan.”

Findings based on data:
- The event “GCM - DOG 4” exists in the available dataset for the fighter record and lists the opponent as “daisuke hanazawa.” However, the location recorded for that event is “tokyo , japan,” not Chiba, Japan.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for the event row “GCM - DOG 4” and identify opponent and location
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location
FROM katsuya_inoue
WHERE lower(event) = lower('GCM - DOG 4');
Result:
- res: win
- record: 11 - 3
- opponent: daisuke hanazawa
- method: decision (majority)
- event: gcm - dog 4
- round: 3
- time: 5:00
- location: tokyo , japan

2) Verify if any “GCM - DOG 4” row is listed in Chiba
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location
FROM katsuya_inoue
WHERE lower(event) = lower('GCM - DOG 4')
  AND lower(location) LIKE '%chiba%';
Result: no rows returned

3) Cross-check all rows where opponent is “daisuke hanazawa”
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'daisuke hanazawa';
Results (two rows):
- Row 1: event: pancrase - shining 10; location: tokyo , japan
- Row 2: event: gcm - dog 4; location: tokyo , japan

4) Check whether any fights are recorded in Chiba (for context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT event, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE location ILIKE '%chiba%';
Results:
- event: mars world grand prix; location: chiba , japan
- event: pancrase - brave 10; location: chiba , japan

Conclusion:
- Supported: At “GCM - DOG 4,” the opponent is recorded as “daisuke hanazawa.”
- Not supported: The claim that this event took place in Chiba, Japan. The dataset records the location as Tokyo, Japan.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the fighter record represented by the table katsuya_inoue (taken as authoritative for this verification task).
- Event name matching was performed case-insensitively exactly as “GCM - DOG 4.”
- Location matching for “Chiba” used case-insensitive substring search.
