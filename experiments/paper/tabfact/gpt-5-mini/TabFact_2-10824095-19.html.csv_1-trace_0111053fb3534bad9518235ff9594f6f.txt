Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (1982 VFL season), 21.16 (142) is indeed recorded as Fitzroy’s home team score (vs St Kilda on 7 August 1982 at Junction Oval). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted as asking whether Fitzroy ever had a home team score of 21.16 (142) within the available data.
- Matching for “Fitzroy” as home team was case-insensitive; the score match was exact-string. The dataset covers the 1982 VFL season only.
