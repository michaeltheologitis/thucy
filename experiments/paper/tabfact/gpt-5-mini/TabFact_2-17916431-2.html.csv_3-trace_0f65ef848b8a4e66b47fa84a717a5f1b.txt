Claim interpreted: “3 of the total game feature have an attendance in the 3000s” is taken to mean “Three games in the dataset have attendance between 3000 and 3999 inclusive.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), Schema: public
- Table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (columns: game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count games with attendance in the 3000s
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE attendance BETWEEN 3000 AND 3999;
Result: count = 3

2) List those games
SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
WHERE attendance BETWEEN 3000 AND 3999
ORDER BY game ASC;
Results:
- game: 4, date: 30 august 2008, opponent: aldershot town, venue: away, result: 2 - 3, attendance: 3805
- game: 10, date: 11 october 2008, opponent: accrington stanley, venue: away, result: 3 - 2, attendance: 3012
- game: 12, date: 21 october 2008, opponent: darlington, venue: away, result: 1 - 2, attendance: 3034

3) Total games for context
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season;
Result: total_games = 43

Assessment:
- The dataset shows exactly 3 games with attendance in the 3000–3999 range. This matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- “game feature” refers to the games listed in public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season.
- “in the 3000s” interpreted as 3000–3999 inclusive using BETWEEN 3000 AND 3999.
- NULL attendances (if any) are excluded from the count by the WHERE clause.
