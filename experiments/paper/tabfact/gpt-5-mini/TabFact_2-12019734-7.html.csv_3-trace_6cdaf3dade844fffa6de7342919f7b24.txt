Claim to verify: When the record is 11 - 35 - 12, the home team is St Louis, and it is against New Jersey.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns (date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text).

Evidence gathered from the data:
1) Count rows exactly matching the claim conditions (record 11-35-12 ignoring spaces; home equals St Louis ignoring case, spaces, and periods; visitor mentions New Jersey):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE replace(record, ' ', '') = '11-35-12'
  AND lower(replace(replace(home, '.', ''), ' ', '')) = 'stlouis'
  AND lower(visitor) LIKE '%new jersey%';
Result:
- match_count = 1

2) Retrieve the matching row details:
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE replace(record, ' ', '') = '11-35-12'
  AND lower(replace(replace(home, '.', ''), ' ', '')) = 'stlouis'
  AND lower(visitor) LIKE '%new jersey%';
Result row:
- date: february 12 | visitor: new jersey | score: 1 - 5 | home: st louis | record: 11 - 35 - 12

Interpretation:
- The data contains exactly one game where the record is 11 - 35 - 12, the home team is St Louis, and the opponent (visitor) is New Jersey. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions used:
- "Record" corresponds to the record column as stored in the table and was compared after removing spaces to allow for formatting variations.
- "Home team be St Louis" was interpreted as the home column equaling St Louis, allowing for case, spacing, and punctuation variations (e.g., St. Louis).
- "Against New Jersey" was interpreted as the visitor containing the phrase "new jersey" (case-insensitive).
