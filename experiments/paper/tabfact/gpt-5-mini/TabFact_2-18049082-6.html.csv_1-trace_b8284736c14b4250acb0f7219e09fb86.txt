Claim: “Danish Thomas Bjørn rank lower than Tiger Woods.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact3 (TabFact), schema: public
- Available table: t_1998_open_championship (columns: place, player, country, score, "to par")

What the data contains
- The only available dataset pertains to the 1998 Open Championship (golf), with players’ finishing places.

Evidence from the data
1) Query to retrieve the placements for Tiger Woods and Thomas Bjørn variants stored in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, place FROM public.t_1998_open_championship
WHERE player ILIKE 'thomas%' OR player ILIKE 'tiger woods%';

Result rows:
- player: thomas bjãrn, place: t6
- player: tiger woods, place: t6

Interpretation
- “t6” denotes a tie for 6th place. In this dataset (1998 Open Championship), Thomas Bjørn and Tiger Woods finished with the same rank. Therefore, Thomas Bjørn did not rank lower than Tiger Woods in this event.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data (1998 Open Championship results), the claim is contradicted: they tied for the same place, so Thomas Bjørn did not rank lower than Tiger Woods.

Assumptions made
- Due to the scope of accessible data, I interpret “rank” as finishing position in the 1998 Open Championship (the only relevant dataset available). If the claim intended world rankings or a different event/date, that information is not present in the available data.
- “Tiger Wood” is interpreted as “Tiger Woods,” and “Danish Thomas Bjørn” refers to the Danish golfer Thomas Bjørn. The table stores his name as “thomas bjãrn,” which was matched via a case-insensitive prefix search on “thomas”.
