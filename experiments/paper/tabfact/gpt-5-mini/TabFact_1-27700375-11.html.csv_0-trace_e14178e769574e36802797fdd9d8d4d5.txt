Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a relevant NBA table for verification.
- Inspected the schema to understand columns, especially the “high assists” field.
- Queried the table to count games where “Jordan Farmar” and “Deron Williams” are listed as the high-assists leader.
- Verified any potential ties by listing distinct entries containing either name.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season

Schema details (from inspection)
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Executed SQL and results
1) Sample rows for context (formatting of “high assists”)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "high assists" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 10;
Results (as returned):
- {game: 75, date: april 1, team: philadelphia, high assists: deron williams (7)}
- {game: 76, date: april 3, team: miami, high assists: deron williams (9)}
- {game: 77, date: april 5, team: minnesota, high assists: deron williams (21)}
- {game: 78, date: april 6, team: detroit, high assists: jordan farmar (11)}
- {game: 79, date: april 8, team: new york, high assists: jordan farmar (9)}
- {game: 80, date: april 10, team: toronto, high assists: jordan farmar (7)}
- {game: 81, date: april 11, team: charlotte, high assists: jordan farmar (9)}

2) Count of games listing Jordan Farmar as high-assists leader
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS jordan_farmar_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%jordan farmar%';
Result:
- jordan_farmar_count: 4

3) Count of games listing Deron Williams as high-assists leader
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS deron_williams_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%deron williams%';
Result:
- deron_williams_count: 3

4) Distinct “high assists” entries containing either name (to check for ties/multiple leaders)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "high assists" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%jordan farmar%' OR lower("high assists") LIKE '%deron williams%';
Results:
- deron williams (21)
- deron williams (7)
- deron williams (9)
- jordan farmar (11)
- jordan farmar (7)
- jordan farmar (9)

5) Total number of games in this table
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Result:
- total_games: 7

Interpretation and conclusion
- Within the available New Jersey Nets 2010–11 season table, Jordan Farmar is listed as the high-assists leader in 4 games, while Deron Williams is listed in 3 games. Therefore, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists in more games than Deron Williams in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to leadership in assists as captured by the “high assists” column for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets table available in this environment.
- Any appearance of a player’s name in the “high assists” field for a game counts as that player leading the team in assists for that game.
- No ties between Jordan Farmar and Deron Williams appear in the distinct entries; if they had, each would have been counted for that game.
