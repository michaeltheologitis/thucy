Claim to verify: "both female have a prison connection in the uk"

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database (connection: postgres_tabfact0), public schema.

Step 2: Inspect schema
- Table: cube_film_series
  - Columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text)

Step 3: Collect evidence
A) Retrieve all records where gender is female and show their prison connection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "prison connection" FROM cube_film_series WHERE lower(gender) = 'female';
- Results:
  - name: joan leaven; prison connection: leavenworth prison (usa)
  - name: dr helen holloway; prison connection: holloway women 's prison (uk)

B) Count female records to confirm "both"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS female_count FROM cube_film_series WHERE lower(gender) = 'female';
- Result: female_count = 2

Findings
- There are exactly two records with gender = female.
- Of these two, one has a prison connection in the UK ("holloway women 's prison (uk)").
- The other has a prison connection in the USA ("leavenworth prison (usa)"), not the UK.

Conclusion
- The claim that both female have a prison connection in the UK is contradicted by the data. Only one of the two female records has a UK prison connection; the other is in the USA.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "both female" to refer to all records in the dataset with gender marked as female.
- Gender matching performed case-insensitively using lower(gender) = 'female'.
- Interpreted "prison connection in the uk" as the prison connection field indicating a UK location (explicitly marked as "(uk)").
