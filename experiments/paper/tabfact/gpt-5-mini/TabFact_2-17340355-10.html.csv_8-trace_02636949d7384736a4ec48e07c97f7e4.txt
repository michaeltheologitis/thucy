Claim: “the game against minnesota have a lower attendance than the game against new orleans.”

Data source explored: TabFact database, table public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season subset). Attendance is embedded in the text column "location attendance"; opponent is in column team.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the relevant games (raw values)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%Minnesota%' OR team ILIKE '%New Orleans%';
Results:
- game 78 | date: april 8  | team: new orleans | location attendance: new orleans arena 17781
- game 80 | date: april 11 | team: minnesota    | location attendance: target center 18478

2) Parse out arena and numeric attendance
SQL:
SELECT
  team,
  game,
  date,
  trim(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[0-9]+$', '')) AS arena_text,
  regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::integer AS attendance_num
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%Minnesota%' OR team ILIKE '%New Orleans%';
Results:
- new orleans | game 78 | april 8  | arena_text: new orleans arena | attendance_num: 17781
- minnesota   | game 80 | april 11 | arena_text: target center      | attendance_num: 18478

3) Confirm uniqueness (one game for each opponent in this table)
SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%Minnesota%' OR team ILIKE '%New Orleans%'
GROUP BY team;
Results:
- minnesota | cnt: 1
- new orleans | cnt: 1

Assessment:
- Minnesota game attendance: 18,478
- New Orleans game attendance: 17,781
- 18,478 is not lower than 17,781; it is higher. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- The table represents Phoenix Suns games; the team column is the opponent.
- Attendance is the trailing number in the "location attendance" text.
- The claim refers to the specific matchups present in this dataset (one game vs Minnesota and one vs New Orleans).
