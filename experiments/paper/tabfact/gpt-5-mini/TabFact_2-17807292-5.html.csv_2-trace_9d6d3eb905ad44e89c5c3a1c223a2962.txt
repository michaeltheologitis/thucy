Summary of findings:
- The table public.t_2008_pga_championship contains results with columns: place, player, country, score, and to par. This appears to document the 2008 PGA Championship.
- Querying for second-place finishes (including ties) shows that both “henrik stenson” (Sweden) and “j b holmes” (United States) are recorded as tied for second (place = t2) with a to par value of “- 1”.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Determine how second place is recorded
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY place;
Result (distinct place values): 1, t2, t4, t7, t9
Interpretation: Tied second is recorded as “t2”.

2) Retrieve second-place finishers (including ties)
SQL:
SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE lower(place) = 't2' OR place = '2' ORDER BY player;
Returned rows:
- henrik stenson | sweden | t2 | - 1
- j b holmes | united states | t2 | - 1

Conclusion:
- The data show that J. B. Holmes (United States) and Henrik Stenson (Sweden) tied for second place with -1 to par. This matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- I treated “tie for second place” as the table’s “t2” designation.
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the event represented by the available dataset table (t_2008_pga_championship), since no other context was provided.
