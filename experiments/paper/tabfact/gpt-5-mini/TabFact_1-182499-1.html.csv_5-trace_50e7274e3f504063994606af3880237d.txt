Conclusion
- The claim that the location of the substrate porphobilinogen and the entry at chromosome 11q23.3 is mitochondrion is contradicted by the data. The relevant entry is annotated with location = cytosol.

Evidence from the data
1) Query: entries where the substrate is porphobilinogen
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT enzyme, substrate, location, chromosome, product FROM public.porphyrin WHERE substrate ILIKE 'porphobilinogen';
- Result:
  • enzyme: pbg deaminase
  • substrate: porphobilinogen
  • location: cytosol
  • chromosome: 11q23.3
  • product: hydroxymethyl bilane

2) Query: entries where chromosome = 11q23.3
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT enzyme, substrate, location, chromosome, product FROM public.porphyrin WHERE chromosome = '11q23.3';
- Result:
  • enzyme: pbg deaminase
  • substrate: porphobilinogen
  • location: cytosol
  • chromosome: 11q23.3
  • product: hydroxymethyl bilane

Interpretation
- Both queries point to the same record (pbg deaminase, also known as hydroxymethylbilane synthase/HMBS). In this dataset, its subcellular location is cytosol, not mitochondrion. Therefore, associating porphobilinogen and chromosome 11q23.3 with mitochondrion is inaccurate per the authoritative table.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “the location of substrate porphobilinogen and chromosome 11q23.3” as referring to the subcellular location field for the porphyrin-pathway entry that has substrate = porphobilinogen and chromosome = 11q23.3 in the available public.porphyrin table.
