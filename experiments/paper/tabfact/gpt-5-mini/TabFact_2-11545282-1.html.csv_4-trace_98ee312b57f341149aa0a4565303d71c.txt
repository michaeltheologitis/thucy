Claim interpreted: After 1985, the United States contributed 4 players, with Louis Amundson being the most recent (within the available Utah Jazz all-time roster data).

Data source discovered
- Database: postgres_tabfact13 (TabFact), schema: public
- Table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Step 1 — Inspect players and derive start years
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz" AS years,
       substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})')::int AS start_year
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
ORDER BY start_year ASC NULLS LAST, player;

Result (excerpt):
- rick adelman — united states — 1974 - 75 — 1974
- j j anderson — united states — 1982 - 85 — 1982
- isaac austin — united states — 1991 - 93 — 1991
- shandon anderson — united states — 1996 - 99 — 1996
- anthony avent — united states — 1998 - 99 — 1998
- john amaechi — england — 2001 - 03 — 2001
- carlos arroyo — puerto rico — 2002 - 05 — 2002
- rafael araãjo — brazil — 2006 - 2007 — 2006
- louis amundson — united states — 2007 — 2007

Step 2 — Count U.S. players whose Jazz tenure started after 1985
Executed SQL (trimming nationality to avoid whitespace mismatches):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_players
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE lower(trim(nationality)) = 'united states'
  AND substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
  AND (substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})'))::int > 1985;

Result:
- count_players = 4

Step 3 — List those U.S. players and start years (>1985)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})') AS start_year_text,
       (substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})'))::int AS start_year
FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE lower(trim(nationality)) = 'united states'
  AND substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
  AND (substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})'))::int > 1985
ORDER BY start_year;

Result:
- isaac austin — start year 1991
- shandon anderson — start year 1996
- anthony avent — start year 1998
- louis amundson — start year 2007

Step 4 — Verify the most recent U.S. player
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz", substring("years for jazz" from '(\d{4})')::int AS start_year
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE lower(nationality) = 'united states'
  AND substring("years for jazz" from '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY start_year DESC
LIMIT 1;

Result:
- player: louis amundson | years for jazz: 2007 | start_year: 2007

Conclusion
- Supported by the data: After 1985, there are exactly 4 players with nationality listed as United States, and the most recent (by start year) is Louis Amundson (2007).

Assumptions
- “After 1985” is interpreted as start_year > 1985, where start_year is the first 4-digit year extracted from the “years for jazz” text.
- The verification is scoped to the available table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (which appears to cover players whose surnames begin with “A”), treated as the authoritative dataset for this task.
- Nationality comparisons are case-insensitive and trimmed of leading/trailing spaces.
