Claim to verify: “14 viral family have a replication site in the nucleus.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact24, schema: public.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.viral_disease with columns: family (text), “baltimore group” (text), envelopment (text), “virion shape” (text), “replication site” (text).

What I checked
1) Count distinct families whose replication site mentions nucleus/nuclear (case-insensitive)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS count_nuclear_families
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%'
     OR "replication site" ILIKE '%nuclear%';
- Result: 9

2) List which families these are (and their replication site values)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT family, "replication site"
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%'
  ORDER BY family;
- Result:
  - adenoviridae — nucleus
  - hepadnaviridae — nucleus
  - herpesviridae — nucleus
  - orthomyxoviridae — nucleus
  - papillomaviridae — nucleus
  - parvoviridae — nucleus
  - polyomaviridae — nucleus
  - retroviridae — nucleus
  - unassigned — nucleus

3) Context: total number of distinct families recorded
- SQL executed (count):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count FROM public.viral_disease;
  Result: 23
- SQL executed (list):
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease ORDER BY family ASC;
  Result (alphabetical): adenoviridae, arenaviridae, astroviridae, bunyaviridae, caliciviridae, coronaviridae, filoviridae, flaviviridae, hepadnaviridae, hepeviridae, herpesviridae, orthomyxoviridae, papillomaviridae, paramyxoviridae, parvoviridae, picornaviridae, polyomaviridae, poxviridae, reoviridae, retroviridae, rhabdoviridae, togaviridae, unassigned

4) Robustness check for any other nuclear terms (substring ‘nucl’)
- SQL executed (list):
  SELECT DISTINCT family, "replication site"
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucl%'
  ORDER BY family;
- Result (same set as step 2): adenoviridae, hepadnaviridae, herpesviridae, orthomyxoviridae, papillomaviridae, parvoviridae, polyomaviridae, retroviridae, unassigned — all “nucleus”.
- SQL executed (count):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucl%';
- Result: 9

Conclusion
- The database supports at most 9 entries whose replication site mentions the nucleus; one of these is labeled “unassigned,” which is not a formal viral family. Counting only named families yields 8. Either way, this is well below the claimed 14.
- Therefore, the claim “14 viral family have a replication site in the nucleus” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- Treated any replication site that contains “nucleus”/“nuclear” (case-insensitive) as indicating nuclear replication.
- Considered “unassigned” not to be a valid viral family for counting families.
- Relied solely on the public.viral_disease table in the discovered database as the authoritative source available here.
