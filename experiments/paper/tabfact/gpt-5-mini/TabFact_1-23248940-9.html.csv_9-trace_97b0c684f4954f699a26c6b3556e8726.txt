Summary
- Interpreting “the bobcat” as the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) and “record” as the team’s running win–loss record reflected in the available 2009–10 season table, the latest (most recent) game in this dataset shows they have more losses than wins.

Data source discovery
- Accessible databases: TabFact (public schema)

Schema overview (queried)
- Table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
  - Rows represent individual games with a running “record” after each game.

Table coverage check
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result:
- row_count = 10, min_game = 47, max_game = 56

Recent games snapshot (context)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, record FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 5;
Results (ordered by game desc):
- game: 56, date: february 24, record: 27 - 29
- game: 55, date: february 22, record: 27 - 28
- game: 54, date: february 20, record: 27 - 27
- game: 53, date: february 19, record: 27 - 26
- game: 52, date: february 16, record: 26 - 26

Final (latest) record in this dataset
SQL:
SELECT record FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1;
Result:
- record = "27 - 29"

Parsed wins and losses and comparison
SQL:
SELECT record,
       regexp_replace(split_part(record, '-', 1), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS wins,
       regexp_replace(split_part(record, '-', 2), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS losses,
       (regexp_replace(split_part(record, '-', 1), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int >
        regexp_replace(split_part(record, '-', 2), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int) AS wins_gt_losses
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
ORDER BY game DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- record = "27 - 29", wins = 27, losses = 29, wins_gt_losses = false

Conclusion
- Based on the most recent game in the available data (game 56), the Bobcats have more losses than wins (27–29). Therefore, the claim that they “have a record of more win than loss” is not supported by the data here.

Assumptions
- “the bobcat” refers to the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA).
- “have a record” refers to the latest running record in the provided table (ordered by game descending).
- The dataset covers games 47–56 of the 2009–10 season (10-row subset). Conclusions are constrained to this data slice.
