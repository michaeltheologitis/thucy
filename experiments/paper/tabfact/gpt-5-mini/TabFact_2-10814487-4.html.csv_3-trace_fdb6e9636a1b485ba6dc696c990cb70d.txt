Claim to verify: "the score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 to 10 and the home team be bradford"

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL TabFact instance
- Relevant table: public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season (columns: date [text], home team [text], score [text], away team [text], goals [text], attendance [bigint], competition [text])

Step 1 — Inspect sample rows to understand formats
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", goals, attendance, competition
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
LIMIT 20;
Key observation: Dates are text with slashes and spaces (e.g., "18 / 02 / 07"), and scores are stored as text in the form "<home> - <away>".

Step 2 — Find the match for 21 July 2007
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", competition
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE date ~ '\m21[\s/\.\-]*0?7[\s/\.\-]*(?:07|2007)\M';
Result returned:
- date: 21 / 07 / 07
  home team: salford city reds
  score: 14 - 10
  away team: bradford
  competition: super league xii

Assessment against the claim
- Score: 14 - 10 — Supported by the data.
- Home team: Claim says "bradford"; data shows the home team was "salford city reds" and Bradford were the away team — Contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The score is correct, but the home team identification is wrong.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the date "21 / 07 / 07" as 21 July 2007 and searched in the 2007 Bradford Bulls season table.
- Interpreted "14 to 10" as the dataset’s "14 - 10" score format.
