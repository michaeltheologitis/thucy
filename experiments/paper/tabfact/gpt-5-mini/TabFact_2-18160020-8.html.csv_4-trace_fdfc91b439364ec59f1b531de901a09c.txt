Claim interpreted: “Álvaro Campos is the goalkeeper for the team that has no average higher than 0.61.” Because the phrasing is ambiguous (“no match”), I evaluate two plausible readings: (A) “no average higher than 0.61” (i.e., average ≤ 0.61), and (B) literal “no matches” (matches = 0).

Data source overview
- Database: postgres_tabfact0, Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (columns: goalkeeper text, goals bigint, matches bigint, average double precision, team text)

Evidence
1) Identify Álvaro Campos’ team, matches, and average
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, team, matches, average FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE lower(goalkeeper) = lower('álvaro campos');
Result:
- goalkeeper: álvaro campos, team: real murcia b, matches: 28, average: 0.86

2) Teams with average not higher than 0.61 (i.e., average ≤ 0.61)
SQL:
SELECT team, goalkeeper, average FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE average <= 0.61 ORDER BY average DESC, team;
Result:
- atlético ciudad — goalkeeper: miguel zapata — average: 0.61
Interpretation: The only team whose average is not higher than 0.61 is Atlético Ciudad, and its goalkeeper is Miguel Zapata, not Álvaro Campos.

3) Check the literal reading “no matches” (matches = 0)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_matches_count FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE matches = 0;
Result:
- zero_matches_count = 0
Interpretation: No team has zero matches; thus there is no team for Álvaro Campos to be associated with under this literal reading either.

Assessment
- Under reading (A) (average ≤ 0.61): The team fitting this condition is Atlético Ciudad with goalkeeper Miguel Zapata, not Álvaro Campos. So the claim is contradicted.
- Under reading (B) (matches = 0): No such team exists; the claim cannot be true.

Conclusion: The data contradict the claim.

Assumptions
- Because “no match” is ambiguous, I tested two interpretations: (A) “no average higher than 0.61” and (B) literal “no matches” (matches = 0). Both lead to the claim being false given the table data.
