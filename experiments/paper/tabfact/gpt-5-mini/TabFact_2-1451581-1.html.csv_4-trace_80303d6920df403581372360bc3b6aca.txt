Summary of data sources examined
- Discovered and used: PostgreSQL instance TabFact (postgres_tabfact34), schema public. Contains a table of world’s busiest airports by cargo traffic.

Relevant schema identified
- Table: public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
  - rank (bigint)
  - airport (text)
  - code (text)
  - total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint)
  - % change (text)
  - Note: No year column; units embedded in the cargo column name.

Evidence collected
1) Locate the Shanghai Pudong International Airport row(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "rank", airport, "total cargo (metric tonnes)" FROM public."world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic" WHERE airport ILIKE '%Shanghai Pudong%';
Result:
- rank: 3, airport: shanghai pudong international airport, total cargo (metric tonnes): 2939157

2) Test the claim under the stated condition (rank > 4 AND airport = 'shanghai pudong international airport')
Executed SQL (maximum cargo under the condition):
SELECT MAX("total cargo (metric tonnes)") AS max_total_cargo
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE lower(airport) = 'shanghai pudong international airport' AND "rank" > 4;
Result:
- max_total_cargo = NULL (no matching rows)

Executed SQL (count rows for that airport):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE lower(airport) = 'shanghai pudong international airport';
Result:
- cnt = 1

Executed SQL (show that single row, to explain mismatch with rank > 4):
SELECT "rank", airport, "total cargo (metric tonnes)"
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE lower(airport) = 'shanghai pudong international airport'
ORDER BY "rank";
Result:
- rank: 3, airport: shanghai pudong international airport, total cargo (metric tonnes): 2939157

Assessment of the claim
- The claim states: when the rank is greater than 4 and the airport is Shanghai Pudong International Airport, the highest total cargo is 2,939,157 metric tonnes.
- Data shows only one row for this airport with rank = 3 (not greater than 4) and total cargo = 2,939,157 metric tonnes. Therefore, there are no rows that satisfy the filter rank > 4 for this airport. Under that filter, the maximum cargo is NULL, not 2,939,157.
- While the cargo value 2,939,157 metric tonnes is correct for Shanghai Pudong International Airport in the table, it does not occur under the stated condition (rank > 4). Hence the conditional claim is not supported by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data because the condition rank > 4 yields no records for Shanghai Pudong International Airport, so no maximum of 2,939,157 can be established under that condition.

Assumptions
- Airport matching performed case-insensitively using the exact text 'shanghai pudong international airport'.
- Verification is based solely on the available TabFact (postgres_tabfact34) dataset and its single relevant table, which lacks a year dimension.
