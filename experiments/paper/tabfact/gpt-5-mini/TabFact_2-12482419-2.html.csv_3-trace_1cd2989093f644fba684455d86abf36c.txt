Summary of findings
- Data source explored: PostgreSQL database TabFact (schema: public). Relevant table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons, which includes columns year, record, win %, and gb (games behind).

Key checks and evidence
1) What is the Nashville Sounds’ 2011 season win percentage and GB?
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT year, record, "win %", gb, league, division
  FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
  WHERE year = '2011';
- Result: year=2011, record=71 - 73, win %=493, gb=9.
- Interpretation: win % 493 corresponds to 0.493. In 2011, GB is 9, not 5.

2) What is the average win percentage for seasons with GB = 5 (regardless of year)?
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT AVG("win %") AS avg_win_pct_raw, AVG("win %")/1000.0 AS avg_win_pct_decimal
  FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
  WHERE gb = '5';
- Result: avg_win_pct_raw=535.0, avg_win_pct_decimal=0.535.

3) Which season(s) have GB = 5?
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT year, record, "win %", gb
  FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
  WHERE gb = '5'
  ORDER BY year;
- Result: year=2010, record=77 - 67, win %=535, gb=5. No 2011 row with GB=5 exists.

Conclusion
- The claim “in 2011, 0.535 be the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5” is not supported by the data in the authoritative table available. In 2011, the Nashville Sounds had a 0.493 win percentage with GB=9. The only instance of GB=5 is in 2010, where the win percentage is 0.535 (and thus the average for GB=5 rows is 0.535), but that is not 2011.

Assumptions
- “gb” is interpreted as games behind; “win %” stored as an integer denoting thousandths (e.g., 493 → 0.493), consistent with query 2’s decimal conversion.
- The available dataset for verification is the Nashville Sounds seasons table; no other standings tables were present in the discovered data sources.
