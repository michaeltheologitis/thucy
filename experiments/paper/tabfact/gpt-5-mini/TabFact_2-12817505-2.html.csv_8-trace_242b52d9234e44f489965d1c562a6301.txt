Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the 2005–06 Manchester United F.C. season table, the last game occurred on 7 May 2006, not on 11 February 2006. There was a match on 11 February 2006, but it was not the final game of the season.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponents (text), "h / a" (text), "result f - a" (text), attendance (bigint), "league position" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to understand date format
SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance, "league position"
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
LIMIT 20;
Key observation: date values are textual like "13 august 2005", "31 december 2005" (day month year, month as full name).

2) Compute the last (maximum) match date in the table
SQL:
SELECT MAX(to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')) AS max_date FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season;
Result:
max_date = 2006-05-07

3) Retrieve the row(s) for the last match date
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') = (SELECT MAX(to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')) FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season);
Result row:
- date: 7 may 2006
- opponents: charlton athletic
- h / a: h
- result f - a: 4 - 0
- attendance: 73006
- league position: 2nd
Interpretation: The final game listed is on 7 May 2006 vs Charlton Athletic.

4) Check if there was a match on 11 February 2006
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%11%' AND (date ILIKE '%feb%' OR date ILIKE '%february%') AND date ILIKE '%2006%';
Result row:
- date: 11 february 2006
- opponents: portsmouth
- h / a: a
- result f - a: 3 - 1
- attendance: 20206
- league position: 2nd

5) Direct comparison: Is 11 February 2006 the latest date?
SQL:
SELECT max(to_date("date", 'DD FMMonth YYYY')) AS max_date FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season;
Result: max_date = 2006-05-07

SQL:
SELECT "date", to_date("date", 'DD FMMonth YYYY') AS parsed_date FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE lower("date") = '11 february 2006';
Result: parsed_date = 2006-02-11

SQL:
SELECT to_date('11 february 2006', 'DD FMMonth YYYY') = (SELECT max(to_date("date", 'DD FMMonth YYYY')) FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season) AS is_latest;
Result: is_latest = false

Assessment
- The table’s latest match date is 2006-05-07, not 2006-02-11.
- Therefore, the statement that “the last game of the season happen on 11 february 2006” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “The season” refers to the only season dataset available in the connected data source: Manchester United F.C. 2005–06 season (table public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season).
- Dates are parsed from the text column using the format 'DD Month YYYY' (case-insensitive for month names).
