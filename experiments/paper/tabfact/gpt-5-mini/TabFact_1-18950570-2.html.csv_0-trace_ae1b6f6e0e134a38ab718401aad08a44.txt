Summary
- Claim: “the cdr for the period 1975 - 1980 be 9.0 and the life expectancy be 61.5.”
- Interpretation: Verify the crude death rate (CDR) and total life expectancy for the period labeled “1975 - 1980” in the available demographic dataset.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL TabFact instance (postgres_tabfact30), public schema.

Schema review
- Relevant table: my_info_table
- Columns: period; live births per year; deaths per year; natural change per year; cbr; cdr; nc; tfr; imr; life expectancy total; life expectancy males; life expectancy females
- This table appears to hold demographic indicators by period.

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "cdr", "life expectancy total" FROM my_info_table WHERE "period" = '1975 - 1980';
- Result:
  - cdr: 9
  - life expectancy total: 61.5

Assessment
- The table shows cdr = 9 (equivalent to 9.0) and life expectancy total = 61.5 for period “1975 - 1980.”
- Therefore, the claim matches the data exactly (allowing for a trivial formatting difference between 9 and 9.0).

Assumptions
- “cdr” is interpreted as crude death rate per 1,000 population and “life expectancy” as total life expectancy in years; units are not explicitly specified in the table.
- The period label “1975 - 1980” corresponds to a single row in my_info_table and refers to the same geographic entity throughout the table (no country/location column is present).
