Claim to verify: "greg ostertag go to oregon state and play for the jazz from 1988 - 90"

Summary conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. Greg Ostertag’s school is listed as Kansas, and his Utah Jazz tenure is 1995–2004 and 2005–06, not 1988–90. The 1988–90 Utah Jazz player from Oregon State is José Ortiz.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Evidence 1: Greg Ostertag’s school and Jazz years
- Result: greg ostertag | 1995 - 2004 , 2005 - 06 | kansas
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE player ILIKE 'Greg Ostertag';

Interpretation: The table records Greg Ostertag’s school as Kansas and his Jazz years as 1995–2004, 2005–06. This contradicts attending Oregon State and playing 1988–90.

Evidence 2: Which Jazz player(s) came from Oregon State (and their years)
- Result: josã ortiz | 1988 - 90 | oregon state
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "player", "years for jazz", "school / club team"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE LOWER("school / club team") LIKE '%oregon state%';

Interpretation: The Jazz player associated with Oregon State during 1988–90 is José Ortiz, not Greg Ostertag.

Overall assessment of claim components
- "greg ostertag go to oregon state": False per Evidence 1 (school = Kansas).
- "[greg ostertag] play for the jazz from 1988 - 90": False per Evidence 1 (Jazz years = 1995–2004, 2005–06). The 1988–90 Jazz player from Oregon State is José Ortiz (Evidence 2).
