Summary of what I checked
- I explored the available database (TabFact) and found one relevant table: public.branimir_suba_i, with columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text). This appears to record match entries for a specific player/team context.
- I verified whether there is any entry on August 22, 2007 that is a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match and whether its result is a loss.
- I also checked what actually happened on August 22, 2007 in this dataset and listed any UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying entries to compare dates and outcomes.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the exact row for August 22, 2007
SQL:
SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result
FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE lower(trim(regexp_replace(date, '\s+,', ',', 'g'))) = lower(trim(regexp_replace('august 22 , 2007', '\s+,', ',', 'g')));
Result:
- date: august 22 , 2007; competition: friendly; venue: dushanbe , tajikistan; score: 2 - 3; result: win
Interpretation: The only entry on August 22, 2007 is a friendly, and the result is a win—not a loss.

2) Check if any August 22, 2007 entry mentions UEFA/Euro/qualifying
SQL:
SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result
FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE date ILIKE '%22%' AND date ILIKE '%2007%'
  AND (competition ILIKE '%euro%' OR competition ILIKE '%qual%' OR competition ILIKE '%uefa%');
Result: no rows
Interpretation: No UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match is recorded on that date in this dataset.

3) List UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying entries to compare dates/results
SQL:
SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result
FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE competition ILIKE '%qualifying%'
   OR competition ILIKE '%UEFA Euro 2008%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: june 2 , 2007; competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying; venue: baku , azerbaijan; score: 1 - 3; result: lost
Interpretation: There is at least one UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying entry in this dataset, but it occurred on June 2, 2007, and ended in a loss. This contradicts the claim’s date of August 22, 2007.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that on August 22, 2007, the match was a friendly with a win, not a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifier and not a loss. Therefore, the claim that the UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying competition had a result of “lost” and was held on August 22, 2007 is not supported by the data; it is contradicted by it.

Assumptions made
- I interpret the claim as referring to the entry for August 22, 2007 within the available dataset. Date matching used the exact textual form found in the table (august 22 , 2007). I treated any competition string containing “UEFA Euro 2008” or “qualifying” as a Euro 2008 qualifying match.
