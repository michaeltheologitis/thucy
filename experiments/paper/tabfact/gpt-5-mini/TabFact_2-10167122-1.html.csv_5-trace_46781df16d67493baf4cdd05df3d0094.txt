Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the relevant schema.
- Queried the brian_watts table to list tournaments and event counts, then ranked tournaments by events (excluding the non-tournament totals row) to determine which is second-highest.

Data source discovery
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: PostgreSQL TabFact instance with schema public; one table: public.brian_watts

Schema inspected
- Table: public.brian_watts
  - Columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), "top - 5" (bigint), "top - 25" (bigint), events (bigint), "cuts made" (bigint)
  - No keys/constraints reported.

Evidence 1: List tournaments by events (raw ordering)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY events DESC;
- Results:
  - totals — 17
  - the open championship — 7
  - pga championship — 6
  - masters tournament — 2
  - us open — 2

Evidence 2: Identify highest and second-highest tournaments by events (excluding totals)
- SQL executed:
  WITH ranked AS (
    SELECT tournament, events, dense_rank() OVER (ORDER BY events DESC) AS rnk
    FROM public.brian_watts
    WHERE tournament NOT ILIKE '%total%'
  )
  SELECT tournament, events, rnk
  FROM ranked
  WHERE rnk <= 2
  ORDER BY rnk, events DESC, tournament;
- Results:
  - the open championship — 7 events — rank 1
  - pga championship — 6 events — rank 2

Conclusion
- The data show that “the open championship” has the highest number of events (7) among tournaments for Brian Watts, not the second-highest. The second-highest tournament by events is the “pga championship” with 6 events.
- Therefore, the claim that the Open Championship is the tournament with his second-highest number of events is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- I interpret “brian watt” as the professional golfer Brian Watts; the table name suggests it is specific to him.
- I treat the row labeled “totals” as an aggregate, not a tournament. If one (incorrectly) includes this aggregate in the ranking, the Open Championship would appear second overall after “totals,” but that would not satisfy the claim as phrased (which refers specifically to a tournament).
