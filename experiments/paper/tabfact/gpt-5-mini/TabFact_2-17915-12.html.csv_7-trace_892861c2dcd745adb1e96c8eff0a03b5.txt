Claim to verify: "only the master series final in cincinnati have a carpet surface"

Data sources discovered
- Using the available tooling, only one accessible relational data source was found: PostgreSQL database TabFact (postgres_tabfact14), schema public, with a single relevant table: public.lleyton_hewitt (columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score).

Plan
1) Check how the Cincinnati event is recorded in this dataset and what surface is listed.
2) Check whether any finals (or events) in this dataset are recorded with a carpet surface.

Evidence
1) Cincinnati entries and their surfaces
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, championship, surface, outcome, opponent, score
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt
WHERE championship ILIKE '%Cincinnati%';

- Results:
2002 | cincinnati | hard | runner - up | carlos moyá | 5 - 7 , 6 - 7 (5 - 7)
2004 | cincinnati (2) | hard | runner - up | andre agassi | 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 2 - 6

Interpretation: In this dataset, Cincinnati finals (Hewitt was runner-up in both listed years) are on hard courts, not carpet.

2) Presence of carpet surfaces in the dataset
2a) Distinct surface values present
- Executed SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.lleyton_hewitt GROUP BY surface ORDER BY count DESC, surface ASC;

- Results summary returned by the tool:
- hard: 5
- carpet (i): 1
- hard (i): 1

Interpretation: At least one event in this dataset has a surface recorded as "carpet (i)" (indoor carpet). This already contradicts any claim that Cincinnati is the only finals surface that could be carpet.

2b) Which event(s) used carpet
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, championship, surface, outcome, opponent
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt
WHERE surface ILIKE 'carpet%'
ORDER BY year;

- Result:
2002 | paris | carpet (i) | runner - up | marat safin

Interpretation: This dataset contains a final on carpet at Paris in 2002 (recorded as runner-up). Regardless of the series classification in this table, it shows that carpet-surface finals exist outside Cincinnati.

Conclusion
- The dataset records Cincinnati finals as being played on hard courts, not carpet.
- The dataset also contains at least one final on carpet for a different championship (Paris 2002).
- Therefore, the claim that "only the master series final in Cincinnati have a carpet surface" is contradicted by the data on two fronts: Cincinnati is not recorded as carpet here, and carpet-surface finals exist elsewhere.

Assumptions and notes
- I interpreted "master series final" as referring to high-level tour finals and checked finals as represented by outcome = "runner - up" (which in this table clearly denotes final-round results). The available dataset reflects Lleyton Hewitt’s results; within this authoritative source, the evidence above suffices to refute the claim. I did not rely on external knowledge beyond what the dataset shows.
