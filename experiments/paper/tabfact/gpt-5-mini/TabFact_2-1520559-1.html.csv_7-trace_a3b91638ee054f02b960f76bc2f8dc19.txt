- Interpreted claim: Se Ri Pak won (was champion) in 2001 and finished second (runner-up) two years later, in 2003, at the Women’s British Open.

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table identified: public.women_s_british_open (columns include year, champion, and runner (s) - up)

Evidence from data
1) Query: Retrieve the champion and runners-up for 2001 and 2003
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2001, 2003) ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2001 | champion: se ri pak | runner (s) - up: mi hyun kim
- 2003 | champion: annika sörenstam | runner (s) - up: se ri pak

Assessment
- The data shows Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001 and the runner-up in 2003. This aligns exactly with the claim of being champion in 2001 and coming second two years later.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the Women’s British Open dataset.

Assumptions
- “2 year after” is interpreted as 2003 (i.e., 2001 + 2).
- “come 2nd place” is interpreted as being listed as a runner-up.
- The event in question is the Women’s British Open, as that is the available authoritative dataset.
