Claim interpreted: “Round 3 be at 3:50.” I interpret this as asserting that there exists a record where round = 3 and the time is 3:50.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.joachim_hansen_fighter (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location)

Schema relevance: This table contains fight results with fields for round and time, suitable for verifying the claim.

Evidence
1) List all rows with round = 3 to inspect their times
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time, res
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
WHERE trim(round) = '3'
LIMIT 100;

Returned rows:
- opponent: tatsuya kawajiri, event: dream 17, method: submission (arm triangle choke), round: 3, time: 2:30, res: loss
- opponent: eiji mitsuoka, event: shooto : back to our roots 6, method: decision (majority), round: 3, time: 5:00, res: loss
- opponent: jason ireland, event: pride 33, method: submission (armbar), round: 3, time: 2:33, res: win
- opponent: kenichiro togashi, event: shooto : alive road, method: decision (unanimous), round: 3, time: 5:00, res: win
- opponent: caol uno, event: deep - 13, method: ko (knee), round: 3, time: 4:48, res: win
- opponent: gesias cavalcante, event: shooto 2004: 7 / 16, method: decision (majority), round: 3, time: 5:00, res: win
- opponent: takanori gomi, event: shooto 2003: 8 / 10, method: decision (majority), round: 3, time: 5:00, res: win
- opponent: takumi nakayama, event: shooto 2002: year - end show, method: decision (majority), round: 3, time: 5:00, res: win

Observation: None of the round-3 rows show a time of 3:50.

2) Explicitly search for time ≈ “3:50” among round = 3 rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
WHERE trim(round) = '3'
  AND (time ILIKE '%3:50%' OR time ILIKE '%3.50%' OR time ILIKE '%3 50%');

Result: cnt = 0

3) Check if any row has time “3:50” (any common format), regardless of round
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, round, time, method, res
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
WHERE time ~ '0?3[:.]50';

Returned row:
- opponent: metin yakut; event: shooto finland : capital punishment 2; round: 2; time: 3:50; method: tko (punches); res: win

Conclusion
- Within the available data (Joachim Hansen fight records), there are no records where round = 3 and time = 3:50. A time of 3:50 does occur, but in round 2 (vs. Metin Yakut). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the “round” and “time” fields in the only accessible dataset (public.joachim_hansen_fighter) and uses standard minutes:seconds formatting. If a different context was intended, the current data environment does not provide it, so verification is performed against this dataset.
