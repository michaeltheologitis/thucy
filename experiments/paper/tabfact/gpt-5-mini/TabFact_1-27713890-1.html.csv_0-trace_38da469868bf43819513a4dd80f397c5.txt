Data source discovery:
- Available authoritative source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.friends_season_5, which includes episode metadata with columns such as "no in series" (overall episode number), "no in season", title, and "original air date".

Evidence gathered:
1) Locate the episode by title and retrieve its overall and season numbers
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "no in series", "no in season", "original air date"
FROM public.friends_season_5
WHERE title ILIKE '%Everybody Finds Out%'
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- title: the one where everybody finds out
- no in series: 111
- no in season: 14
- original air date: february 11 , 1999

2) Confirm the match is unique in the table
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.friends_season_5
WHERE title ILIKE '%Everybody Finds Out%';
Result:
- match_count: 1

Executed SQL (list matching rows):
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title
FROM public.friends_season_5
WHERE title ILIKE '%Everybody Finds Out%'
ORDER BY "no in series";
Result:
- no in series: 111 | no in season: 14 | title: the one where everybody finds out

Findings:
- The episode titled “The One Where Everybody Finds Out” has overall series number ("no in series") = 111 and is Season 5, Episode 14, aired February 11, 1999.

Conclusion:
- The claim that it is episode number 111 (111.0) is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “The one where everybody find out” refers to the Friends episode “The One Where Everybody Finds Out”.
- “Episode number” refers to the overall series number (“no in series”), not the season-specific number.
- Case-insensitive title matching (ILIKE) was used to locate the row due to capitalization differences in stored data.
