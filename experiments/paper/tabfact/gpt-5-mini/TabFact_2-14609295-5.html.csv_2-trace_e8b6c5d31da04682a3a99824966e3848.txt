Claim to verify: "in 2011, the southwest region win a total of 5 game and lose 1 game create a record of 28 - 12"

Data sources checked: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema).

Evidence 1: Retrieve 2011 row with region, record, and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, region, record, seed, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 2011;
- Result:
  year: 2011
  region: southwest
  record: 28 - 12
  seed: 11
  results: "w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70"

Interpretation: The 2011 entry shows region = "southwest", season record = "28 - 12", and a sequence of tournament game results that includes five wins (w) and one loss (l).

Evidence 2: Count wins and losses in 2011 results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT t.year,
         SUM(wc.cnt) AS wins_count,
         SUM(lc.cnt) AS losses_count
  FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball t
  LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM regexp_matches(t.results, '(^|[[:space:]])w([[:space:]]|$)', 'g')
  ) wc ON true
  LEFT JOIN LATERAL (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM regexp_matches(t.results, '(^|[[:space:]])l([[:space:]]|$)', 'g')
  ) lc ON true
  WHERE t.year = 2011
  GROUP BY t.year;
- Result:
  year: 2011, wins_count: 5, losses_count: 1

Conclusion:
- The data shows for 2011: region = "southwest", wins = 5, losses = 1 (in tournament results), and overall record = 28 - 12. This aligns with the claim.

Assumptions made (for clarity):
- "southwest region" refers to the team’s NCAA Tournament region assignment (the row corresponds to VCU Rams men’s basketball placed in the Southwest region in 2011).
- "win a total of 5 game and lose 1 game" refers to the tournament game outcomes encoded in the "results" field for 2011, not the full-season game count.
- "record of 28 - 12" refers to the season record shown in the "record" column for 2011.
