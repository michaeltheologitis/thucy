Summary
- Claim: “In the 1981 Open Championship no player finish under par.”
- Finding: In the available dataset (table t_1981_open_championship), there are no entries with a negative to-par value; all listed players are at even par (e) or over par (+1, +2). However, the table appears to represent a single-round leaderboard snippet (scores 70–72 with places like t1, t3, t9) rather than full 72-hole final standings. Therefore, the claim is supported within this dataset’s scope but cannot be confirmed for the entire championship.

Data Source Discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), public schema.
- Relevant table identified: t_1981_open_championship
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text)

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Count total rows (players) in the table
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_players FROM t_1981_open_championship;
Result: [{"total_players":16}]

2) Check whether any player is under par (to-par begins with '-' or Unicode minus '−')
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS under_par_count FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE "to par" LIKE '-%' OR "to par" LIKE '−%';
Result: [{"under_par_count":0}]
Interpretation: No entries show a negative to-par value in this table.

3) Distinct to-par values and their counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY "to par"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "to par";
Result:
+ 2 — 8 rows
+ 1 — 6 rows
E   — 2 rows
Interpretation: Only even par and over-par values appear.

4) Score range present (assesses whether this is likely a single-round snippet)
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score, MAX(score) AS max_score
FROM t_1981_open_championship;
Result: min_score = 70, max_score = 72
Interpretation: Scores of 70–72 suggest single-round scoring (not a 72-hole total), reinforcing that this table is not full tournament results.

5) Distinct place values (to understand leaderboard context)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM t_1981_open_championship;
Result: t9, t1, t3
Follow-up (ordered):
SQL executed:
SELECT place, lower(place) AS lp
FROM t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY place, lp
ORDER BY lp;
Result (ordered): t1, t3, t9
Interpretation: Place indicators such as t1, t3, t9 are consistent with a round leaderboard with ties, not final positions for the entire field.

6) “Winners” in this dataset (t1) and their to-par values
SQL executed:
SELECT player, "to par", place FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place IN ('1','t1');
Result: [{"place":"t1","player":"vicente fernã¡ndez","to par":"e"},{"place":"t1","player":"nick job","to par":"e"}]
Interpretation: Leaders listed are at even par, further supporting that there are no under-par entries in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The accessible data shows zero players under par; all entries are E, +1, or +2. Within this dataset, the claim is supported.
- Limitation: The table appears to reflect a single-round leaderboard snippet (16 rows, scores 70–72, tie places), not the entire championship’s final standings. Therefore, we cannot verify the broader claim about the full tournament finish solely from this data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “finish” relative to the scope of the provided table, which appears to be a single-round leaderboard subset for the 1981 Open Championship.
- Treated place values with a leading 't' (e.g., t1) as tied positions for that round.
