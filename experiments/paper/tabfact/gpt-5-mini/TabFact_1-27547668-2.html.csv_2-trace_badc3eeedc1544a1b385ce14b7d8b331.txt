Claim interpreted: There are 2 episodes in the series that were directed by Mike Clattenburg.

Data source discovery
- Available source: postgres_tabfact22 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  - Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "viewers" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "prod code" (bigint)
  - This table lists episodes for the TV series “Republic of Doyle,” including directors.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%mike clattenburg%';
Result:
- match_count = 2

2) List the matching episodes
SQL:
SELECT "Unnamed: 0", title, "directed by", "written by", viewers, "original airdate", "prod code" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%mike clattenburg%' ORDER BY "Unnamed: 0";
Results:
- Unnamed: 0 = 1; title = "fathers and sons"; directed by = "mike clattenburg"; written by = "allan hawco , perry chafe and malcolm macrury"; viewers = 969000; original airdate = "january 6 , 2010"; prod code = 101
- Unnamed: 0 = 3; title = "duchess of george"; directed by = "mike clattenburg"; written by = "allan hawco , perry chafe and malcolm macrury"; viewers = 685000; original airdate = "january 20 , 2010"; prod code = 103

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 2 episodes in the series (Republic of Doyle) directed by Mike Clattenburg. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “the series” refers to the series represented by the available table: Republic of Doyle.
- Director matching is case-insensitive and allows for potential multiple names in the field by using a substring match (ILIKE '%mike clattenburg%').
