Summary
- The sequence of NCAA tournament results you provided — w 59 - 46, w 74 - 56, w 94 - 76, w 72 - 71 ot, w 71 - 61, 62 - 70 — matches the 2011 VCU Rams men’s basketball NCAA tournament run. However, the season record associated with that entry in the data is 28 - 12, not 27 - 9.

What the data shows
- Matching row found in the dataset:
  - year: 2011
  - record: 28 - 12
  - seed: 11
  - region: southwest
  - results: w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70

Conclusion
- The results sequence is correct for VCU’s 2011 tournament run, but the record is 28 - 12, not 27 - 9. Therefore, the claim that these results “have the record of 27 - 9” is not supported by the data.

Executed SQL (exact queries)
1) Verify accessible tables in the public schema:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

2) Inspect seasons and results to locate the matching entry:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
ORDER BY year;

3) Directly select the row with the specified results sequence (case-insensitive match):
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
WHERE results ILIKE '%w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70%';

Assumptions
- Interpreted the shorthand as NCAA tournament results with w/l indicating win/loss and ot indicating overtime.
- Interpreted the question as asking whether that exact results sequence corresponds to a season with a 27 - 9 overall record in the available dataset.
- Relied on the single available authoritative dataset (TabFact public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball).
