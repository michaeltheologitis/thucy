What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a table of U.S. House elections for 1974.
- Queried for the election where Goodloe Byron was the incumbent and inspected the candidates and percentages.

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact31)
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Locate the 1974 race with Goodloe Byron as incumbent
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, result, candidates FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Goodloe Byron%';

Result:
- district: maryland 6
- incumbent: goodloe byron
- party: democratic
- result: re - elected
- candidates: goodloe byron (d) 73.7% elton r wampler (r) 26.3%

2) Extract vote percentages from the candidates field
Executed SQL:
SELECT unnest(regexp_matches(candidates, '([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?%)', 'g')) AS percentage
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Goodloe Byron%';

Result:
- 73.7%
- 26.3%

Assessment
- The 1974 Maryland 6th District U.S. House election lists Goodloe Byron (D) as the incumbent and winner, with 73.7% of the vote against Elton R. Wampler (R) with 26.3%.
- The user’s opponent spelling (“elton rwampler”) differs slightly; the data shows “elton r wampler.” The party and percentage align exactly.

Conclusion
- The claim that Goodloe Byron (D) won with 73.7% of the vote against Elton R. Wampler (R) in the election where he was the incumbent is supported by the 1974 data.

Assumptions
- The available dataset covers the 1974 U.S. House elections; I interpreted the claim to refer specifically to the 1974 Maryland 6th District race because that is the only accessible record for Goodloe Byron in the connected data.
