Claim to verify: "only 2 game be play on november 27"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team (columns include: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify all distinct dates and their counts to see how many entries exist for November 27.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team GROUP BY date ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result (excerpt):
  - november 14 — 1
  - november 17 — 1
  - november 21 — 1
  - november 24 — 1
  - november 27 — 1

2) Retrieve the row(s) for November 27 to confirm details.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record
  FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team
  WHERE lower(date) = 'november 27';
- Result:
  - game: 5 | date: november 27 | team: virginia tech | score: w 61 - 50 | location attendance: palestra , philadelphia , pa (3750) | record: 4 - 1

3) Explicitly count rows whose date equals November 27 (case-insensitive) to quantify.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE lower(trim(date)) = 'november 27';
- Result: 1

Assessment:
- The table shows exactly 1 game on November 27 (not 2). Therefore, the claim "only 2 game be play on november 27" is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim within the scope of the accessible data: the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball team table. "Game be play on November 27" was taken to mean the number of games recorded in this table with date equal to "november 27" (case-insensitive, trimmed).
