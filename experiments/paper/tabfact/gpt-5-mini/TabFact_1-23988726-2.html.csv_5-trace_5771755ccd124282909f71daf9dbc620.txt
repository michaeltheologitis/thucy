Claim to verify: “September 3, 2004 is the date when Daniel Lincoln hit the Asian record.”

Data source explored: TabFact database (public schema). Identified a table (public.my_info_table) that records steeplechase records with columns for record type, athlete, time, location, and date.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve full table to understand entries
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table;
Key relevant results observed:
- Row 4 shows: date = "3 september 2004", athlete = "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )", time = "7:53.63", location = "brussels , belgium", record type = "asian record".
- Row 5 shows: date = "14 july 2006", athlete = "daniel lincoln ( usa )", time = "8:08.82", location = "rome , italy", record type = "north american record".

2) Directly confirm the entry for 3 September 2004
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "3 september 2004" = '3 september 2004';
Result (single matching row):
- date: "3 september 2004"
- athlete: "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )"
- time: "7:53.63"
- location: "brussels , belgium"
- record type: "asian record"

Analysis:
- The data show that on 3 September 2004, Saif Saaeed Shaheen (QAT) set the Asian record (and world-class mark) in the 3000m steeplechase with 7:53.63 in Brussels.
- Daniel Lincoln (USA) is recorded as setting the North American record on 14 July 2006 in Rome with 8:08.82—not on 3 September 2004, and not an Asian record.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. September 3, 2004 corresponds to Saif Saaeed Shaheen’s Asian record, not Daniel Lincoln’s. Daniel Lincoln’s record was North American and occurred on July 14, 2006.

Assumptions:
- “Asian record” and other entries in the table refer to the 3000m steeplechase event, as implied by the athlete names, times, and known historical results.
- “Daniel Lincoln” refers to the American steeplechase runner (USA).
