Claim interpreted: The user appears to refer to a coin characterized by diameter 14 mm and weight 0.55 g.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a reachable PostgreSQL database: TabFact.
- Schema inspection identified a numismatics-related table: public.peseta(value text, equiv text, diameter text, weight text, composition text).

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT value, equiv, diameter, weight, composition
  FROM public.peseta
  WHERE diameter ILIKE '%14%' AND weight ILIKE '%0.55%';

- Result row:
  - value: 1 ₧
  - equiv: 0.006 (0.01)
  - diameter: 14 mm
  - weight: 0.55 g
  - composition: aluminium

Assessment of the claim:
- A coin with diameter 14 mm and weight 0.55 g exists in the dataset: the 1 peseta coin. This supports the factual content about the dimensions and mass.
- The user’s phrasing says “weight of 14 mm,” which mixes units (mm is length, not weight). While likely a wording error, it is imprecise.

Conclusion:
- The core factual statement (a coin with 14 mm diameter and 0.55 g weight) is supported by the data, specifically identifying the 1 peseta coin made of aluminium.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “weight of 14 mm weight 0.55 g” as “diameter 14 mm and weight 0.55 g.”
