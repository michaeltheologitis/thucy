Claim to verify: “担 / 擔 be the only character that have a metric value measure in kg.”

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database TabFact (public schema) with table public.chinese_units_of_measurement.
- Table columns: jyutping, character, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" (all text).

Evidence collected
1) Overview of all units in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT character, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement;
Result rows (character | portuguese | relative value | metric value | imperial value):
- 厘 | liz | 1 / 1600 | 37.79931 mg | ~0.2133 dr
- 分 | condorim | 1 / 1600 | 377.9936375 mg | ~0.2133 dr
- 錢 | maz | 1 / 160 | 3.779936375 g | ~2.1333dr
- 兩 | tael | 1 / 16 | 37.79936375 g | ~1.3333oz
- 斤 | cate | 1 | 604.78982 g | ~1.3333lb
- 担 / 擔 | pico | 100 | 60.478982 kg | ~133.3333lb

2) Direct check for entries expressed in kilograms
Executed SQL:
SELECT character, "metric value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '%kg%';
Result:
- 担 / 擔 | 60.478982 kg

3) Count of entries with metric value in kilograms
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_kg FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '%kg%';
Result:
- count_kg = 1

Assessment
- In this dataset, only the entry for “担 / 擔” has its metric value expressed in kilograms (“60.478982 kg”).
- All other characters’ metric values are given in mg or g, not kg.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data in this table: “担 / 擔” is the only character whose metric value is recorded in kilograms.

Assumptions and scope
- I interpreted the claim with respect to the accessible dataset (public.chinese_units_of_measurement). Broader statements about all Chinese characters or other datasets were not evaluated here, as I grounded the verification strictly on the available data source.
