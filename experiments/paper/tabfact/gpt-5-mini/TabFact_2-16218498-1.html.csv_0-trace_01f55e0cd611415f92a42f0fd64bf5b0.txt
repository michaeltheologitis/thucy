Conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset of featured ties, the Saint - Louis FC vs Young Africans tie has the highest combined aggregate (total goals across the two legs).

What I checked
- Interpreted “combined agg” as the sum of both teams’ aggregate goals shown in the agg column, ignoring any penalty shootout values in parentheses.
- Verified which tie(s) have the maximum combined total across all featured ties in the table.

Evidence from data
1) Inspection of all featured ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;

Key row relevant to the claim:
- Row: team 1 = "saint - louis fc", team 2 = "young africans", agg = "2 - 7" (total 9)

2) Explicit computation of combined aggregate totals and identification of the maximum
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1" AS team1, "team 2" AS team2, agg,
 ((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[1])::int
 + ((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[2])::int
 AS computed_total,
 (((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[1])::int
 + ((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[2])::int) =
 max(((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[1])::int
 + ((regexp_match(regexp_replace(agg,'\\(.*\\)',''),'([0-9]+)[^0-9]+([0-9]+)'))[2])::int) OVER ()
 AS is_highest
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
ORDER BY computed_total DESC, team1, team2;

Result highlights:
- saint - louis fc vs young africans: agg = "2 - 7", computed_total = 9, is_highest = true
- Next highest: cd elá nguema vs primeiro de agosto: agg = "2 - 6", computed_total = 8
- No other tie reaches 9.

Therefore, the Saint - Louis FC tie has the highest combined aggregate among all featured ties in the dataset.

Assumptions
- “Featured game(s)” refers to all ties listed in the available table public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- “Combined agg” means the sum of the two numbers in the agg field, ignoring any penalty shootout values displayed in parentheses.
