Claim to verify
- Interpreted claim: In the same period when there were 900,000 deaths per year, there were also 2,500,000 people of natural change per year (natural change = births − deaths).

Data source discovery and structure
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, schema “public”.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns including: period (text), "deaths per year" (text), "natural change per year" (text), and other demographic indicators.

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Inspect sample rows (to understand formatting and available periods)
SQL:
SELECT period, "deaths per year", "natural change per year" FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 20;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table;
Results (11 total rows in table; selected rows shown):
- 1950 - 1955: deaths per year = 900 000; natural change per year = 1 672 000
- 1955 - 1960: deaths per year = 947 000; natural change per year = 1 971 000
- 1960 - 1965: deaths per year = 986 000; natural change per year = 2 317 000
- 1965 - 1970: deaths per year = 998 000; natural change per year = 2 332 000
- 1970 - 1975: deaths per year = 1 014 000; natural change per year = 2 427 000
- 1975 - 1980: deaths per year = 1 043 000; natural change per year = 2 698 000
- 1980 - 1985: deaths per year = 1 064 000; natural change per year = 2 910 000
- 1985 - 1990: deaths per year = 1 055 000; natural change per year = 2 702 000
- 1990 - 1995: deaths per year = 1 058 000; natural change per year = 2 461 000
- 1995 - 2000: deaths per year = 1 086 000; natural change per year = 2 538 000
- 2000 - 2005: deaths per year = 1 147 000; natural change per year = 2 425 000

2) Verify the exact period with deaths per year = 900,000 and its natural change value
SQL:
SELECT period, "deaths per year", "natural change per year"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE regexp_replace("deaths per year", '[^0-9-]', '', 'g')::bigint = 900000;
Result:
- period: 1950 - 1955; deaths per year: 900 000; natural change per year: 1 672 000
Interpretation: In the only period with exactly 900,000 deaths per year, natural change was 1,672,000 — not 2,500,000.

3) Check whether any period has natural change per year = 2,500,000
SQL:
SELECT period, "natural change per year", "deaths per year"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE regexp_replace("natural change per year", '[^0-9-]', '', 'g')::bigint = 2500000;
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: There is no period with natural change exactly equal to 2,500,000.

4) (Corroboration) Show parsed numeric values and verify no near-match has both conditions
SQL:
SELECT period,
       regexp_replace("deaths per year", '[^0-9.-]', '', 'g')::bigint AS deaths_per_year,
       regexp_replace("natural change per year", '[^0-9.-]', '', 'g')::bigint AS natural_change_per_year
FROM public.my_info_table
ORDER BY deaths_per_year NULLS LAST;
Results excerpt:
- 1950 - 1955: deaths 900000; natural change 1672000
- 1995 - 2000: deaths 1086000; natural change 2538000
- 1970 - 1975: deaths 1014000; natural change 2427000
Interpretation: Periods with natural change around 2.5M have deaths around 1.0–1.15M, not 900k.

Conclusion
- The data shows that the period with 900,000 deaths per year (1950–1955) had a natural change of 1,672,000, not 2,500,000. No period has natural change exactly 2,500,000. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Period” refers to the period column in public.my_info_table.
- Numbers like 900000 and 2500000 are interpreted as exact annual counts (not approximate), and the claim refers to both occurring in the same period.
