Claim interpreted: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Maggs Magnificent Mild is its most decorated beer between 1995 and 2009.” I take “most decorated” to mean the beer with the highest number of prizes/awards recorded in that time window.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: west_berkshire_brewery

Schema details (used to ground the analysis)
- Columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)
- No primary keys or foreign keys; all columns nullable.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count prizes per beer between 1995 and 2009 inclusive
SQL:
SELECT "beer name" AS beer, COUNT(*) AS prizes
FROM west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
GROUP BY "beer name"
ORDER BY prizes DESC, beer;
Result:
- maggs magnificent mild — 10
- dr hexter 's healer — 5
- good old boy — 5
- full circle — 2
- mr chubb 's lunchtime bitter — 2
- dr hexter 's wedding ale — 1
- mash tun — 1
- old father thames — 1
- skiff — 1

2) Determine the maximum prize count in that period
SQL:
SELECT MAX(prizes) AS max_prizes FROM (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS prizes
  FROM west_berkshire_brewery
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
  GROUP BY "beer name"
) t;
Result:
- max_prizes = 10

3) Identify the beer(s) with that maximum count
SQL:
SELECT "beer name" AS beer, COUNT(*) AS prizes
FROM west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
GROUP BY "beer name"
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
  SELECT MAX(prizes) FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS prizes
    FROM west_berkshire_brewery
    WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
    GROUP BY "beer name"
  ) t
)
ORDER BY beer;
Result:
- maggs magnificent mild — 10

Conclusion
- Between 1995 and 2009 inclusive, “maggs magnificent mild” has the highest number of recorded prizes (10), ahead of the next-closest beers at 5. This supports the claim that it is the brewery’s most decorated beer in that period.

Assumptions
- “Most decorated” is interpreted as the most prizes/awards (row count in the prizes table) within the specified years.
- The period 1995–2009 is inclusive.
- The lowercase “maggs magnificent mild” in the data corresponds to the claimed “Magg’s Magnificent Mild.”
