Claim to verify: “the best record list be 29 - 7, in 2012, when they receive a 5 seed.”

Conclusion: The database shows VCU’s best listed season record is 29–7 in 2012. However, in 2012 they received a 12 seed, not a 5 seed. VCU received a 5 seed in 1981, 1983, and 2013, with records 24–5, 24–7, and 27–9, respectively.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Full table overview
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball ORDER BY year ASC;
Results (year | record | seed | region | results):
- 1980 | 18 - 12 | 12 | east | l 72 - 86
- 1981 | 24 - 5  | 5  | east | w 85 - 69 l 56 - 58 ot
- 1983 | 24 - 7  | 5  | east | w 76 - 67 l 54 - 56
- 1984 | 23 - 7  | 6  | east | w 70 - 69 l 63 - 78
- 1985 | 26 - 6  | 2  | west | w 81 - 65 l 59 - 63
- 1996 | 24 - 9  | 12 | southeast | l 51 - 58
- 2004 | 23 - 8  | 13 | east | l 78 - 79
- 2007 | 28 - 7  | 11 | west | w 79 - 77 l 79 - 84 ot
- 2009 | 24 - 10 | 11 | east | l 64 - 65
- 2011 | 28 - 12 | 11 | southwest | w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70
- 2012 | 29 - 7  | 12 | midwest | w 62 - 59 l 61 - 63
- 2013 | 27 - 9  | 5  | south | w 88 - 42 l 53 - 78

2) 2012 season specifics
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 2012;
Result:
- 2012 | 29 - 7 | seed: 12 | region: midwest | results: w 62 - 59 l 61 - 63

3) Seasons with a 5 seed
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE seed = 5 ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1981 — 24 - 5
- 1983 — 24 - 7
- 2013 — 27 - 9

4) Verify “best record” by parsing wins and losses
Executed SQL:
-- Confirm format
SELECT DISTINCT record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball ORDER BY record LIMIT 200;

-- Compute wins/losses and rank
SELECT year, record, trim(split_part(record, '-', 1))::int AS wins, trim(split_part(record, '-', 2))::int AS losses
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
ORDER BY wins DESC, losses ASC, year DESC;
Top result confirms 2012 has the highest wins: 2012 | 29 - 7 | wins = 29 | losses = 7

Assessment of sub-claims:
- “best record … 29 - 7”: Supported (2012 has the most wins among listed seasons).
- “in 2012”: Supported.
- “when they receive a 5 seed”: Contradicted; 2012 seed was 12. 5-seed years were 1981, 1983, and 2013 with different records.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the VCU Rams men’s basketball team (as per the only available table) and “seed” refers to NCAA tournament seed.
- “Best record” means the season with the highest number of wins in the provided table.
