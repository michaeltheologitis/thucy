- Date: 1998 - 05 - 21 | Venue: kobe universiade memorial stadium kobe , japan | Score: 1 - 0 | comp: kirin cup | report id: 456

Conclusion
- The dataset shows Kirin Cup matches took place on 1998-05-17 and 1998-05-21. Therefore, the claim that the Kirin Cup had games on both May 17 and May 21, 1998 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Game” refers to a match in the Kirin Cup tournament.
- Date strings like “1998 - 05 - 17” correspond to May 17, 1998.
- The table captures Paraguay’s 1998 matches, and entries labeled “kirin cup” are tournament fixtures, which is sufficient to confirm that the Kirin Cup had games on those dates.
