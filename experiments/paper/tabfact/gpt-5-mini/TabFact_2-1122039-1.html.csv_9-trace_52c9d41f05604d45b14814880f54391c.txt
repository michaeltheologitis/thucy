Data sources explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact7 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
- Columns: driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, tyre

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify engine values present in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT engine FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix ORDER BY engine;
- Result (partial):
  - ferrari v12s
  - alfa romeo l8s
  - fiat l4s
  - maserati l4s
  - talbot l6

2) Retrieve all rows where engine = 'ferrari v12s'
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, tyre
  FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  WHERE engine = 'ferrari v12s';
- Result rows (driver / entrant / constructor / chassis / engine / tyre):
  - alberto ascari / scuderia ferrari / ferrari / ferrari 125 / ferrari v12s / p
  - raymond sommer / scuderia ferrari / ferrari / ferrari 125 / ferrari v12s / p
  - luigi villoresi / scuderia ferrari / ferrari / ferrari 125 / ferrari v12s / p
  - peter whitehead / scuderia ferrari / ferrari / ferrari 125 / ferrari v12s / p

3) Verify Raymond Sommer’s row
- SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  WHERE lower(driver) = 'raymond sommer';
- Result (1 row):
  - driver: raymond sommer
  - entrant: scuderia ferrari
  - constructor: ferrari
  - chassis: ferrari 125
  - engine: ferrari v12s
  - tyre: p

Interpretation
- The table is specifically for the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix. Within this event, there is a record for Raymond Sommer driving a Ferrari 125 with a “ferrari v12s” engine. Therefore, the “when” is: at the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix (as indicated by the table’s scope).

Assumptions
- “When” refers to the event captured by the available table (1950 Swiss Grand Prix), as no date column is present and this is the only discoverable relevant data source.
- String comparisons were made case-insensitively for the driver name and exactly for the engine label as recorded in the data (lowercase).
