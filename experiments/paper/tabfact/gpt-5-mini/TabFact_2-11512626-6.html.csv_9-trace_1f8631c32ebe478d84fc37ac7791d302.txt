FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
WHERE loss ILIKE '%Remlinger%'
ORDER BY date;

Result:
- august 27 | reds | 7 - 5 | remlinger (6 - 6) | 48032 | 64 - 70

Conclusion
- The data shows no game on August 25 where Remlinger took the win against the Rockies. Instead, on August 27, Remlinger (6-6) is listed as the losing pitcher vs. Colorado. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence and is contradicted in both date and outcome.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1997 MLB season and the Colorado Rockies, as that is the available authoritative dataset in scope. Dates are stored as text; matching used case-insensitive patterns for "August 25".
