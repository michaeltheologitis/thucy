What I checked
- Available data sources: Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) containing one relevant table: public.t_1977_pittsburgh_steelers_season, which includes week, date, opponent, and time (et) fields.

Evidence from the data
- I queried the table for Week 14 to verify the scheduled start time.
- Result returned:
  - week: 14
  - date: sunday december 18
  - opponent: san diego chargers
  - time (ET): 4:00 pm

Executed SQL (exact)
SELECT week, date, opponent, "time ( et )" AS time
FROM public.t_1977_pittsburgh_steelers_season
WHERE week = 14;

Assessment
- The data shows the Week 14 game (for the 1977 Pittsburgh Steelers) started at 4:00 pm ET, not 9:00 pm. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions made
- "Week 14" and "the game" refer to the Week 14 entry in the only available schedule table (1977 Pittsburgh Steelers season).
- Times are interpreted in Eastern Time as indicated by the column name ("time ( et )").
