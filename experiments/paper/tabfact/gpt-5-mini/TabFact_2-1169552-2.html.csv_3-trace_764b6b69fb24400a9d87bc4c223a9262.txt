Claim to verify:
"nine elm works be the manufacturer of an undine with a 2 - 4 - 0wt wheel arrangement from 1884 - 1886"

Summary conclusion:
- The dataset confirms a class named "undine" built by "nine elms works" with wheel arrangement "2 - 4 - 0" and built in 1859–60, withdrawn 1884–1886. It does not show "WT" for Undine, and 1884–1886 refers to withdrawals, not the build period. Therefore, the claim mixes true and false elements.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL (TabFact/postgres_tabfact4), schema public, table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway (owner: guest_user).

Schema used:
- Table public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway columns: class (text), wheel arrangement (text), manufacturer (text), year made (text), quantity made (text), quantity preserved (text), year (s) withdrawn (text).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Test for a record matching all parts of the claim (Nine Elms + Undine + 2-4-0WT + built 1884–1886):
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE manufacturer ILIKE '%Nine Elms%'
  AND (class ILIKE '%Undine%')
  AND ("wheel arrangement" ILIKE '%2-4-0WT%' OR "wheel arrangement" ILIKE '%2-4-0 WT%')
  AND ("year made" ~ '^[0-9]{4}$' AND ("year made")::int BETWEEN 1884 AND 1886);
Result: No rows matched.

2) Retrieve the Undine entry directly:
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE "class" ILIKE 'undine';
Result (full row):
{ "class": "undine",
  "manufacturer": "nine elms works",
  "quantity made": "12",
  "quantity preserved": "0",
  "wheel arrangement": "2 - 4 - 0",
  "year (s) withdrawn": "1884 - 1886",
  "year made": "1859 - 60" }
Key points from this row:
- Manufacturer: nine elms works (matches the claim)
- Wheel arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0 (does NOT include WT)
- Year made: 1859 - 60 (not 1884–1886)
- Year(s) withdrawn: 1884 - 1886 (likely the source of the date range in the claim)

3) Check whether any Undine entry has a WT suffix in wheel arrangement:
SQL:
SELECT "class", "manufacturer", "wheel arrangement", "year made"
FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE lower("class") = 'undine' AND "wheel arrangement" ILIKE '%WT%';
Result: 0 rows.

4) Confirm that 2-4-0WT types exist in the dataset (and who built them):
SQL:
SELECT class, manufacturer, "wheel arrangement", "year made"
FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE "wheel arrangement" ILIKE '%2 - 4 - 0%'
  AND "wheel arrangement" ILIKE '%WT%';
Results:
- minerva | nine elms works | 2 - 4 - 0wt | 1856
- nelson  | nine elms works | 2 - 4 - 0wt | 1858
- nile    | nine elms works | 2 - 4 - 0wt | 1859
- 177     | beyer , peacock & co (82) nine elms works (3) | 2 - 4 - 0wt | 1863 - 1875
Interpretation: Nine Elms Works did build other 2-4-0WT classes, but Undine is not one of them according to this dataset.

5) Explicitly show build vs withdrawal years for Undine:
SQL:
SELECT "class", "year made", "year (s) withdrawn" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE lower("class") = 'undine';
Result:
- class: undine
- year made: 1859 - 60
- year(s) withdrawn: 1884 - 1886

Assessment of each element of the claim:
- Manufacturer: "nine elms works" — Supported.
- Class/name: "undine" — Supported.
- Wheel arrangement: "2 - 4 - 0wt" — Not supported (Undine is recorded as "2 - 4 - 0" without WT).
- Date range "from 1884 - 1886": Not supported as a build period (the dataset shows 1859–60 as the build years). The range 1884–1886 corresponds to withdrawals, not manufacturing.

Overall reasoning:
- The dataset confirms Undine was a Nine Elms Works product with a 2‑4‑0 arrangement built 1859–60 and withdrawn 1884–86. The claim incorrectly appends WT to the wheel arrangement and assigns 1884–1886 as the timeframe (which applies to withdrawal, not construction).

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "nine elm works" as "nine elms works" (case-insensitive match).
- Treated "undine" as a class entry in the provided table (no separate naming table exists).
- Interpreted "from 1884 - 1886" as implying a build period unless otherwise stated; the dataset shows this as the withdrawal period for Undine.
- String matching performed case-insensitively on relevant fields.
