Summary of data sources and schema
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema) containing table public.mobile_telephony_in_africa.
- Schema (relevant columns): provider (text), country (text), subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint), subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint), growth % (double precision). Subscriber counts are stored in thousands.

Evidence
1) Verified the exact column names
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='mobile_telephony_in_africa';
Result:
- provider
- country
- subscribers (2005) (thousands)
- subscribers (2006) (thousands)
- growth %

2) Retrieved Vodafone Egypt subscriber counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE '%vodafone%' AND country ILIKE '%egypt%';
Result row:
- provider: vodafone
- country: egypt
- subscribers (2005) (thousands): 6125
- subscribers (2006) (thousands): 8704

Interpretation
- The table explicitly records “subscribers (2006) (thousands)” = 8704 for Vodafone in Egypt, which equals 8,704,000 subscribers in absolute terms.

Conclusion
- The numeric value 8704 for Vodafone’s 2006 subscribers in Egypt matches the database (noting that the unit is thousands).

Assumptions
- Treated “provider” as the operator name (Vodafone) and used case-insensitive matching.
- Interpreted the user’s number as the value recorded in the table, which is expressed in thousands (i.e., 8704 thousand).
