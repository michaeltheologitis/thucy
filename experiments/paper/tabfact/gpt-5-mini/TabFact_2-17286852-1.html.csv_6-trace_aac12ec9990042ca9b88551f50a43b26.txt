Claim to verify: “McVille have Goose River Bridge which be currently under construction due to structural issue.”

Summary conclusion:
- McVille (Nelson County) has a bridge named “Nesheim Bridge.”
- The “Goose River Bridge” found in the data is located in Hillsboro (Traill County) and was removed in 2009, not “currently under construction.”
- No evidence of any entry mentioning construction status or structural issues.

Evidence from the data
1) Search for any references to “Goose River” or “McVille” across all text columns
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, listed, location, county, type FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE name ILIKE '%goose river%'
     OR listed ILIKE '%goose river%'
     OR location ILIKE '%goose river%'
     OR county ILIKE '%goose river%'
     OR type ILIKE '%goose river%'
     OR name ILIKE '%mcville%'
     OR listed ILIKE '%mcville%'
     OR location ILIKE '%mcville%'
     OR county ILIKE '%mcville%'
     OR type ILIKE '%mcville%';
- Key results:
  • nesheim bridge | listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 | location: mcville | county: nelson | type: pratt through truss
  • goose river bridge | listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25 | location: hillsboro | county: traill | type: pratt through truss

Interpretation: McVille is associated with Nesheim Bridge. Goose River Bridge exists in Hillsboro (not McVille) and was removed in 2009.

2) Explicitly list bridges associated with McVille/Nelson County by name
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%bridge%' AND (location ILIKE '%McVille%' OR county ILIKE '%Nelson%');
- Result:
  • nesheim bridge | listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 | location: mcville | county: nelson | type: pratt through truss

Interpretation: Confirms the McVille bridge is “Nesheim Bridge,” not “Goose River Bridge.”

3) Entries with “goose” in name or location to confirm location/status of Goose River Bridge
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, listed, location, county, type
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE name ILIKE '%goose%'
     OR location ILIKE '%goose%';
- Result:
  • goose river bridge | listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25 | location: hillsboro | county: traill | type: pratt through truss

Interpretation: The only Goose River Bridge in the dataset is in Hillsboro and is noted as removed in 2009.

4) Check for any status notes mentioning “construction” or “structural”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, listed, location, county
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE listed IS NOT NULL
    AND (
      listed ILIKE '%construction%'
      OR listed ILIKE '%under construction%'
      OR listed ILIKE '%structural%'
    );
- Result: No rows returned.

Interpretation: No entries indicate a bridge is under construction or has noted structural issues in the status field.

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “McVille have Goose River Bridge”: Not supported. Data shows McVille’s bridge is “Nesheim Bridge.” “Goose River Bridge” is in Hillsboro, Traill County.
- “currently under construction due to structural issue”: Not supported. The only Goose River Bridge entry was removed in 2009; no evidence of construction or structural-issue notes.

Final assessment: The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “McVille” refers to McVille, North Dakota (Nelson County), consistent with the data showing “mcville” and “nelson.”
- The “listed” field records listing status/dates (e.g., National Register) and notes such as removal, which are treated as authoritative status indicators.
