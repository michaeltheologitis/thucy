Claim to verify: "6 cash have earnings of 39380"

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact, schema: public, table: my_info_table(season text, events bigint, cashes bigint, "match play" bigint, "tv finals" bigint, "pba titles" bigint, average double precision, earnings bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all rows where cashes = 6
SQL:
SELECT season, events, cashes, earnings FROM public.my_info_table WHERE cashes = 6;
Result:
- season: 2002 - 03, events: 7, cashes: 6, earnings: 9500

2) Check if any row has cashes = 6 AND earnings = 39380
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE cashes = 6 AND earnings = 39380;
Result:
- cnt: 0

3) Retrieve any row with earnings = 39380 (to see associated cashes)
SQL:
SELECT season, events, cashes, earnings FROM public.my_info_table WHERE earnings = 39380;
Result:
- season: 2011 - 12, events: 13, cashes: 10, earnings: 39380

Findings:
- The only row with cashes = 6 has earnings = 9500, not 39380.
- There is no row where cashes = 6 and earnings = 39380 (count = 0).
- The earnings value 39380 is present for a row with cashes = 10, not 6.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the available table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "6 cash" to mean the cashes column equals 6 in public.my_info_table. No other relevant tables were found in the accessible schema.
