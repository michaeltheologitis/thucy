Claim to verify: “the sla4h (m0) model have a release date of q2 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL source: postgres_tabfact0 (TabFact) with a single table public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors containing Intel Pentium Dual-Core microprocessor entries, including S-Specs and release dates.

Method
1) Searched for an entry with S-Spec containing “SLA4H” and inspected its release date.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Check for exact case-insensitive equality (no matches):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "sspec number" ILIKE 'SLA4H';

Result: cnt = 0.

2) Check for S-Spec values that contain “SLA4H” as a substring (case-insensitive):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "sspec number" ILIKE '%SLA4H%';

Result: cnt = 1.

3) Retrieve the matching row and extract stepping (if present within parentheses in the S-Spec field), along with the release date:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", regexp_replace("sspec number", '^.*\\(([^)]+)\\).*$','\\1') AS stepping, "release date"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "sspec number" ILIKE '%SLA4H%';

Result row:
- model number: pentium dual - core t2390
- sspec number: sla4h (m0)
- stepping: m0
- release date: q2 2008

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly lists the S-Spec “sla4h (m0)” with release date “q2 2008.” This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “sla4h (m0) model” as referring to the S-Spec code SLA4H with stepping M0 as recorded in the “sspec number” field. The table has no separate stepping column; stepping was parsed from the text in parentheses. Matching was done case-insensitively.
