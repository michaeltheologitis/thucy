Summary
- Claim: "home team carlton play away team st kilda at princess park"
- Finding: Supported by the 1927 VFL season dataset. A match is recorded with home team Carlton, away team St Kilda, at "princes park" (minor spelling difference from "princess park").

Data source inspected
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), schema public
- Table: public.t_1927_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date")

Executed SQL and results
1) Evidence query
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "venue", "date", "home team score", "away team score" FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'Carlton' AND "away team" ILIKE 'St Kilda' AND "venue" ILIKE '%prince%';
Result:
- home team: carlton
  away team: st kilda
  venue: princes park
  date: 10 september 1927
  home team score: 15.16 (106)
  away team score: 7.9 (51)

Assessment of each part of the claim
- Home team: Carlton — True (matches row above)
- Away team: St Kilda — True (matches row above)
- Venue: "Princess Park" — Substantively true; dataset lists "princes park" (the standard name). Spelling difference does not alter the venue identification.
- Existence of the match — True (recorded on 10 September 1927).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data, with only a minor spelling variance in the venue name.

Assumptions
- Verification is based on the available 1927 VFL season table. The claim does not specify a year; I verified it within this dataset.
- Case-insensitive and partial venue matching ("%prince%") was used to capture variants like "Princes Park" and possible misspellings.
