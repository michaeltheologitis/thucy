Claim interpreted: In the available season standings data, any team with exactly 3 losses has 0 ties.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1894_ahac_season (contains team, games played, wins, losses, ties, goals for/against)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Confirm table structure
Query:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1894_ahac_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result:
[{"column_name":"team","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"games played","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"wins","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"losses","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"ties","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"goals for","data_type":"bigint"},{"column_name":"goals against","data_type":"bigint"}]

2) Retrieve teams with exactly 3 losses and their tie counts
Query:
SELECT team, ties FROM public.t_1894_ahac_season WHERE losses = 3;
Result:
[{"team":"montreal hockey club","ties":0},{"team":"ottawa hockey club","ties":0},{"team":"montreal victorias","ties":0},{"team":"quebec hockey club","ties":0}]

Analysis:
- Every team returned with exactly 3 losses has 0 ties in this dataset.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data in the 1894 AHAC season table: teams with 3 losses have 0 ties.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the available 1894 AHAC season dataset (public.t_1894_ahac_season).
- The phrasing "the team with 3 loss have 0 tie" is interpreted as "any team with 3 losses has 0 ties" rather than implying there is only one such team.
