Claim interpreted: “william malone never direct after season 6.” I verify this against the available data source (postgres_tabfact12.public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes), which I treat as authoritative.

Step 1: Check what seasons exist (context)
- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE season IS NOT NULL ORDER BY season;
- Result (abridged): 1, 2, 3, …, 21

- SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(season) AS max_season FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes;
- Result: max_season = 21

Step 2: Find episodes directed by William Malone and identify their seasons
- SQL executed:
SELECT season, title, "director (s)" FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE lower("director (s)") LIKE '%william malone%' ORDER BY season, title;
- Result rows:
  • season 2 — title: heartbreak hotel — director (s): william malone
  • season 6 — title: lucky stiff — director (s): william malone
  • season 13 — title: easy come , easy go — director (s): william malone

Step 3: Count how many William Malone-directed episodes occur after season 6
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, SUM(CASE WHEN season > 6 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS after_season_6 FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE lower("director (s)") LIKE '%william malone%';
- Result: total = 3, after_season_6 = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows William Malone directed an episode in season 13 (“easy come , easy go”), which is after season 6. Therefore, the claim that he “never direct after season 6” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the TV episodes represented in the available dataset (table: list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes), inferred to represent the series “Freddy’s Nightmares.”
- “After season 6” is interpreted as season > 6.
- Director matching was case-insensitive and substring-based on the "director (s)" text field.
