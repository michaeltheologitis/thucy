Data sources discovered
- Connected database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Available table: t_1971_south_african_grand_prix(driver TEXT, constructor TEXT, laps BIGINT, "time / retired" TEXT, grid BIGINT)

Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted within the only available dataset (1971 South African Grand Prix entries). The phrase “more ford than any other with alfa romeo and matra tying for the least” is taken to mean that, when grouping entries by engine manufacturer extracted from the constructor field, “Ford” occurs most frequently, and “Alfa Romeo” and “Matra” are tied for the fewest occurrences.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct constructors and their frequencies
SQL:
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY constructor
ORDER BY freq DESC, constructor;
Result (constructor — freq):
- march - ford — 4
- brabham - ford — 3
- brm — 3
- ferrari — 3
- mclaren - ford — 3
- surtees - ford — 3
- lotus - ford — 2
- tyrrell - ford — 2
- march - alfa romeo — 1
- matra — 1

2) Engine grouping (engine = substring after the last hyphen in constructor; if no hyphen, engine = constructor). Counts ordered descending.
SQL:
SELECT engine, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM (
  SELECT TRIM(
    CASE
      WHEN constructor LIKE '%-%' THEN substring(constructor from '[^-]+$')
      ELSE constructor
    END
  ) AS engine
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
) AS sub
GROUP BY engine
ORDER BY count DESC, engine;
Result (engine — count):
- ford — 17
- brm — 3
- ferrari — 3
- alfa romeo — 1
- matra — 1

3) Targeted counts for Ford, Alfa Romeo, and Matra (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT e.engine, COALESCE(cx.count,0) AS count
FROM (VALUES ('ford'),('alfa romeo'),('matra')) AS e(engine)
LEFT JOIN (
  SELECT LOWER(TRIM(
    CASE
      WHEN constructor LIKE '%-%' THEN substring(constructor from '[^-]+$')
      ELSE constructor
    END
  )) AS engine, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  GROUP BY engine
) AS cx USING (engine)
ORDER BY e.engine;
Result (engine — count):
- alfa romeo — 1
- ford — 17
- matra — 1

Conclusion
- Ford appears more than any other engine manufacturer (17 vs. the next highest at 3).
- Alfa Romeo and Matra each appear once, tying for the least.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated within the only available dataset (the 1971 South African Grand Prix table).
- Engine manufacturer is derived as the substring after the last hyphen in constructor; if no hyphen, the constructor name itself is treated as the engine manufacturer. Trimming and case-insensitive matching were applied.
