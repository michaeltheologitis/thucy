Summary conclusion: In the available data (2008–09 Phoenix Suns season table, games 75–82), the highest attendance was against Dallas (20,301), not New Orleans (17,781). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact6), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season with columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text).

Key evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect all available rows (to understand structure and values)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
LIMIT 10;
Result (8 rows exist):
- game=75, date="april 1", team="houston", location attendance="us airways center 18422", record="41 - 34"
- game=76, date="april 3", team="sacramento", location attendance="us airways center 18422", record="42 - 34"
- game=77, date="april 5", team="dallas", location attendance="american airlines center 20301", record="42 - 35"
- game=78, date="april 8", team="new orleans", location attendance="new orleans arena 17781", record="43 - 35"
- game=79, date="april 10", team="memphis", location attendance="fedexforum 15908", record="43 - 36"
- game=80, date="april 11", team="minnesota", location attendance="target center 18478", record="44 - 36"
- game=81, date="april 13", team="memphis", location attendance="us airways center 18422", record="45 - 36"
- game=82, date="april 15", team="golden state", location attendance="us airways center", record="46 - 36"

2) Parse attendance and rank by attendance
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team AS opponent, "location attendance" AS location_attendance,
       NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::integer AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
ORDER BY attendance DESC NULLS LAST, game;
Key results (attendance in descending order):
- Dallas: 20,301 (game 77)
- Minnesota: 18,478 (game 80)
- Houston: 18,422 (game 75)
- Sacramento: 18,422 (game 76)
- Memphis: 18,422 (game 81)
- New Orleans: 17,781 (game 78)
- Memphis: 15,908 (game 79)
- Golden State: NULL (no numeric attendance provided) (game 82)

3) Maximum attendance and which opponent(s) have it
SQL (max value):
SELECT MAX(NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'), '')::int) AS max_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season;
Result: 20301

SQL (rows at that maximum):
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance",
       NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'), '')::int AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'), '')::int = 20301;
Result: game=77, date=april 5, team=dallas, location attendance="american airlines center 20301", attendance=20301

4) Attendance for the game vs New Orleans
SQL (raw row):
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%New Orleans%';
Result: game=78, date=april 8, team=new orleans, location attendance="new orleans arena 17781"

SQL (numeric extraction):
SELECT game, date, "location attendance",
       regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS attendance_number
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%New Orleans%';
Result: attendance_number=17781 (game 78)

Conclusion based on data: The highest attendance in the available dataset is 20,301 for the game vs Dallas. The game vs New Orleans had 17,781, which is not the highest. Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and scope:
- Scope is limited to the available table public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season, which contains 8 rows (games 75–82 of the Suns' 2008–09 season). If the claim intended a different season/team/dataset, the conclusion may differ; however, I relied strictly on the available data.
- I treated the column "team" as the opponent and extracted attendance by removing non-digit characters from the "location attendance" field.
- Rows without numeric attendance (e.g., Golden State) are treated as NULL and excluded from maxima comparisons.
