Claim to verify: "fitzroy be the team with the highest away team score"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23), public schema.
- Relevant table found: public.t_1954_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date".

Schema check (context)
- Tool summary indicated the table and columns above. No foreign keys or additional tables relevant to away scores were found.

Score format check
- Sample rows show scores in the format goals.behinds (total), e.g., "15.4 (94)". The integer inside parentheses is the total points.

Evidence
1) Preview (to confirm score format and teams)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Result:
- hawthorn — 7.6 (48)
- south melbourne — 13.12 (90)
- essendon — 11.14 (80)
- melbourne — 15.4 (94)
- footscray — 9.14 (68)
- fitzroy — 9.15 (69)

2) Order away teams by extracted total points (parsed from parentheses)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", CAST(substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS total
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total DESC;
Result (away team | away team score | total):
- melbourne | 15.4 (94) | 94
- south melbourne | 13.12 (90) | 90
- essendon | 11.14 (80) | 80
- fitzroy | 9.15 (69) | 69
- footscray | 9.14 (68) | 68
- hawthorn | 7.6 (48) | 48

3) Confirm maximum and the team(s) achieving it
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS max_total
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
Result: max_total = 94

Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", CAST(substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS total
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) = (
  SELECT MAX(CAST(substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER))
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
)
ORDER BY "away team" ASC;
Result:
- melbourne | 15.4 (94) | 94

Conclusion
- Based on all rows in public.t_1954_vfl_season, the highest away team score is 94 by melbourne. Fitzroy’s highest away score in this table is 69. Therefore, the claim that Fitzroy is the team with the highest away team score is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "Highest away team score" refers to the total points value inside parentheses in the "away team score" field.
- The scope is the available dataset (1954 VFL season table) since no other seasons or tables were discoverable with the provided tools.
