Summary
- I explored the only available data source (TabFact/postgres_tabfact5) and found a table for the 1982 VFL season containing home/away scores as text. I then searched for any match where the home team score is 20.20 (140) and the away team score is 16.22 (118).

Evidence
1) Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database accessible (TabFact/postgres_tabfact5) with a public schema.

2) Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Finding: Table public.t_1982_vfl_season with columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

3) Verification query
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team","away team",date,venue,crowd,"home team score","away team score"
  FROM public.t_1982_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team score" = '20.20 (140)' AND "away team score" = '16.22 (118)';
- Result: One match found
  • Home team: hawthorn
  • Away team: collingwood
  • Date: 7 august 1982
  • Venue: princes park
  • Crowd: 18699
  • Home team score: 20.20 (140)
  • Away team score: 16.22 (118)

Conclusion
- The claim that 16.22 (118) was the away team score against a home team score of 20.20 (140) is supported by the 1982 VFL season data (Hawthorn vs Collingwood, 7 Aug 1982).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to Australian rules football scoring notation and is intended to be verified against the available 1982 VFL season dataset. Scores were matched exactly as stored in text fields.
