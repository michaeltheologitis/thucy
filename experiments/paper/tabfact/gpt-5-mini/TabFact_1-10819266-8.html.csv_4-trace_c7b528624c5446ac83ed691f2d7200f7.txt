Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there are more than 23 episodes in the season whose season premiere date is September 23, 2009.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.csi_franchise

Schema examined (public.csi_franchise):
- Columns: season (bigint), episodes (bigint), time slot (est) (text), season premiere (text), season finale (text), tv season (text), rank (bigint), viewers (in millions) (double precision)

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Initial identification of seasons with a premiere on any September 23 (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT season, episodes, "season premiere", "tv season", (episodes > 23) AS more_than_23
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE "season premiere" ILIKE '%September 23%';
Result (abbreviated):
- {season: 6, episodes: 23, season premiere: "september 23 , 2009", tv season: "2009 - 2010", more_than_23: false}
- {season: 8, episodes: 18, season premiere: "september 23 , 2011", tv season: "2011 - 2012", more_than_23: false}

2) Precise match for September 23, 2009:
SQL:
SELECT season, episodes, "season premiere", "tv season", (episodes > 23) AS more_than_23
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE "season premiere" ILIKE '%September 23%' AND "season premiere" ILIKE '%2009%';
Result:
- {season: 6, episodes: 23, season premiere: "september 23 , 2009", tv season: "2009 - 2010", more_than_23: false}

Finding:
- The season with a premiere date of September 23, 2009 (season 6) has 23 episodes. Therefore, episodes > 23 is false.

Conclusion: The claim that there are more than 23 episodes for the season premiering on September 23, 2009 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "Episode" refers to the total number of episodes in the season row(s) of the csi_franchise table.
- The relevant season is identified by the text value "september 23 , 2009" in the "season premiere" column, matched case-insensitively due to formatting in the source data.
