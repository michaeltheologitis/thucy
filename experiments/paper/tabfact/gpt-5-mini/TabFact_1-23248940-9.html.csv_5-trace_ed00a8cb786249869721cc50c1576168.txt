Claim evaluated: “the second low attendance figure for a game be 12376.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows 12,376 is the lowest attendance, not the second-lowest. The second-lowest distinct attendance is 13,352.

Key evidence from the database
- Data source discovered: tabfact12 (public schema), table t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season with a “location attendance” text column that contains venue and trailing attendance digits.

1) Listing games with extracted numeric attendance (ascending)
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date,
       regexp_replace("location attendance", ' *[0-9]+ *$', '') AS venue,
       CAST(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
ORDER BY attendance ASC, game ASC;

Result (attendance ascending):
- game 50 | date: february 9  | venue: time warner cable arena | attendance: 12376
- game 51 | date: february 10 | venue: target center           | attendance: 13352
- game 52 | date: february 16 | venue: time warner cable arena | attendance: 13712
- game 55 | date: february 22 | venue: staples center          | attendance: 15892
- game 54 | date: february 20 | venue: bradley center         | attendance: 17174
- game 48 | date: february 3  | venue: staples center          | attendance: 18997
- game 49 | date: february 6  | venue: time warner cable arena | attendance: 19164
- game 53 | date: february 19 | venue: time warner cable arena | attendance: 19568
- game 56 | date: february 24 | venue: energysolutions arena   | attendance: 19911
- game 47 | date: february 1  | venue: rose garden             | attendance: 20106

Observation: The lowest attendance is 12,376. The next (second-lowest) is 13,352.

2) Confirming second-lowest distinct attendance value
Executed SQL (distinct attendance list):
SELECT DISTINCT NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS attendance
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY attendance ASC;

Result (distinct attendance values):
[12376, 13352, 13712, 15892, 17174, 18997, 19164, 19568, 19911, 20106]

Executed SQL (rows at the second-lowest value 13352):
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists", "location attendance", record,
NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS attendance_int
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int = 13352;

Result (matching row):
- game: 51
- date: february 10
- team: minnesota
- score: w 93 - 92 (ot)
- high points: stephen jackson (33)
- high rebounds: nazr mohammed (20)
- high assists: dj augustin (7)
- location attendance: target center 13352
- record: 26 - 25
- attendance_int: 13352

Assessment of the claim
- The statement that the second-lowest attendance is 12,376 is contradicted by the data.
- 12,376 is the lowest attendance, not the second-lowest.
- The second-lowest distinct attendance is 13,352.

Assumptions
- “Second low attendance figure” is interpreted as the second-lowest distinct numeric attendance across all rows in the table public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season.
- Attendance was extracted by removing non-digit characters from the “location attendance” text field and casting to integer. All rows contained trailing digits interpretable as attendance.
