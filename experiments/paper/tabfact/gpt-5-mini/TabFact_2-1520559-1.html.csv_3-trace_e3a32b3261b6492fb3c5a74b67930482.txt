What I checked
- The claim appears to say: Jiyai Shin won the 2012 Open by beating Inbee Park by 9 strokes. I interpreted “Open” to mean the Women’s British Open.

Data sources explored
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact via postgres_tabfact11) with a relevant table: public.women_s_british_open containing year, champion, runner(s)-up, and margin of victory among other fields.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
- Query: 
  SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" AS runners_up, "margin of victory" 
  FROM public.women_s_british_open 
  WHERE year = 2012;

- Result:
  [{"year":2012, "champion":"jiyai shin", "runners_up":"inbee park", "margin of victory":"9 strokes"}]

Assessment of the claim
- Champion: Jiyai Shin — supported by the data.
- Runner-up: Inbee Park — supported by the data.
- Margin of victory: 9 strokes — supported by the data.
- Year: 2012 — matches the row retrieved.

Conclusion
- The data directly confirms that Jiyai Shin won the 2012 Women’s British Open by 9 strokes over Inbee Park.

Assumptions
- “2012 open” is taken to mean the 2012 Women’s British Open (not the men’s Open Championship).
