Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Purpose: Find any matches against Wightlink Raiders and check their venue/date
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, competition FROM t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Wightlink%';

- Minor differences in capitalization (e.g., "wightlink raiders") are not material to the claim.
