Conclusion
- Both names appear for the state of Jin in the 820s BC. Specifically: Marquis Xi of Jin has a start date of 840 BC (thus covering the early part of the 820s), and Marquis Xian of Jin has a start date of 822 BC (thus covering the later part of the 820s). If you mean the later 820s BC, the name is Xian; if you mean the early 820s, it is Xi.

Evidence from the data
1) Confirm how the state values are stored
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT state FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc ORDER BY state;
Result excerpt shows: ... jin ...

2) Retrieve leaders for state = Jin (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT state, type, name, title, "royal house", "from"
FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc
WHERE lower(state) = 'jin'
ORDER BY "from" ASC;
Rows returned:
- state: jin, type: sovereign, name: xi,   title: marquis, royal house: ji, from: 840 bc
- state: jin, type: sovereign, name: xian, title: marquis, royal house: ji, from: 822 bc

Notes on interpretation
- The table lists state leaders relevant to the 820s BC; the "from" column is a start year. With no explicit end year, we infer inclusion means their reign intersects the 820s BC.
- Therefore, Marquis Xi (start 840 BC) would cover the early 820s BC until succeeded, and Marquis Xian (start 822 BC) covers the later 820s BC.

Assumptions made
- "State be Jin" refers to the state column value 'jin' in this dataset.
- "Name" refers to the leader's personal/posthumous name stored in the name column.
- Timeframe is the 820s BC, matching the dataset's scope.
