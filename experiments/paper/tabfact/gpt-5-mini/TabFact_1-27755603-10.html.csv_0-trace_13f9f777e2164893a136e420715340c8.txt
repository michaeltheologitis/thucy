Claim to verify: Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points in 2 games during this period of the 2010–2011 season.

Summary conclusion: Verified. In the available game log covering Pistons games 62–73 of the 2010–11 season (March 1–26, 2011), Rodney Stuckey is listed as the high points scorer in exactly 2 games.

Evidence from data

1) Identify the period covered by the available dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game, MIN(date) AS min_date, MAX(date) AS max_date, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
- Result:
  • MIN(game) = 62
  • MAX(game) = 73
  • MIN(date) = march 1 (note: text comparison)
  • MAX(date) = march 9 (note: text comparison; see next query for accurate end date)
  • COUNT(*) = 12

- Executed SQL to get accurate start/end dates using game numbers:
select game, date from public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season where game in ((select min(game) from public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season), (select max(game) from public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season)) order by game;
- Result rows:
  • {"game": 62, "date": "march 1"}
  • {"game": 73, "date": "march 26"}

Interpretation: The dataset spans games 62–73 (12 games) from March 1 to March 26, 2011.

2) Count how many of these games list Rodney Stuckey as the high points leader
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rodney FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Rodney Stuckey%';
- Result: {"count_rodney": 2}

- Executed SQL (list the games):
SELECT date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Rodney Stuckey%' ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  • {"date":"march 1","team":"milwaukee","score":"l 90 - 92 (ot)","high points":"rodney stuckey (25)"}
  • {"date":"march 20","team":"atlanta","score":"l 96 - 104 (ot)","high points":"rodney stuckey (22)"}

These results show Rodney Stuckey led (or tied for lead, if ties are denoted similarly) the Pistons in points in exactly 2 games within this 12‑game period.

Assumptions and notes
- “This period” is interpreted as the period represented in the only available dataset: Pistons games 62–73 of the 2010–11 season (March 1–26, 2011).
- “Led the team in points” is interpreted as being listed in the table’s “high points” field for a given game. The match was done case-insensitively; ties (if any) would be counted as leading.
- The “team” column represents the opponent, as per table content.
- Dates are stored as text; chronological range was derived via game numbers to avoid lexicographic date issues.
