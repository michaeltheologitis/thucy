Assumptions made
- Interpreted “in the 3000s” as attendance between 3000 and 3999 inclusive, and “in the 12000s” as 12000 to 12999 inclusive.
- Interpreted “total game feature” as all games listed in the table public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (43 games for the 2008–09 Bradford City A.F.C. season).
