Claim interpreted: The speed of a Giant Drop ride with a 200-foot drop is 56 mph.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public
- Relevant table: public.drop_tower_scream_zone (columns stored as text with units, e.g., "200feet", "62 mph")

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Find rides with model 'giant drop' and a 200-foot drop height
SQL:
SELECT park, "model", "drop height", speed FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE lower("model") = 'giant drop' AND "drop height" LIKE '%200%';
Result:
- park = canada 's wonderland, model = giant drop, drop height = 200feet, speed = 62 mph

2) List all 'giant drop' model entries for context
SQL:
SELECT park, "drop height", speed, model FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE lower(model) LIKE '%giant drop%';
Results:
- canada 's wonderland | drop height: 200feet | speed: 62 mph | model: giant drop
- carowinds | drop height: 100feet | speed: 56 mph | model: giant drop
- california 's great america | drop height: 207feet | speed: 62 mph | model: giant drop

3) Find entries with speed exactly '56 mph'
SQL:
SELECT "drop height", "model", "park" FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE "speed" = '56 mph';
Result:
- drop height: 100feet | model: giant drop | park: carowinds

Assessment:
- The only Giant Drop entry with a 200-foot drop (Canada's Wonderland) has a recorded speed of 62 mph, not 56 mph.
- The 56 mph speed appears in this dataset only for a Giant Drop with a 100-foot drop (Carowinds), not for a 200-foot drop.

Conclusion: The claim that a 200-foot Giant Drop's speed is 56 mph is contradicted by the data in the available authoritative table.

Assumptions:
- "giant drop 200 foot" refers to a Giant Drop model ride with a drop height of 200 feet (as stored in the 'drop height' column).
