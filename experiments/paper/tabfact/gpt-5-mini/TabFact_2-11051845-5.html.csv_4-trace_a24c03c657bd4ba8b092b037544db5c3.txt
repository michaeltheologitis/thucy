Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact16 (public schema). Relevant table: list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 with columns including "object type" and "declination ( j2000 )" (text).

Interpretation and method
- I interpret “the list” as the table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.
- I ranked rows by the stored declination text (the column is text, not numeric). Then I checked which object type appears at rank 2.

Key evidence
1) Ranking all rows by the stored declination text (descending)
Executed SQL:
select row_number() over (order by "declination ( j2000 )" desc) as rank_by_text_dec, "ngc number", "object type", "declination ( j2000 )" from list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 order by rank_by_text_dec;

Result excerpt (full result contained 5 rows):
1. rank_by_text_dec=1, ngc number=5474, object type=spiral galaxy, declination ( j2000 )=" degree39′45″"
2. rank_by_text_dec=2, ngc number=5466, object type=globular cluster, declination ( j2000 )=" degree32′04″"
3. rank_by_text_dec=3, ngc number=5477, object type=irregular galaxy, declination ( j2000 )=" degree27′40″"
4. rank_by_text_dec=4, ngc number=5408, object type=irregular galaxy, declination ( j2000 )=" degree22′44″"
5. rank_by_text_dec=5, ngc number=5457, object type=spiral galaxy, declination ( j2000 )=" degree20′53″"

2) Directly retrieving the row at rank 2 (by stored declination text)
Executed SQL:
select * from (select "ngc number", "object type", "declination ( j2000 )", row_number() over (order by "declination ( j2000 )" desc) as rn from list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000) t where rn=2;

Result:
{ "ngc number": 5466, "object type": "globular cluster", "declination ( j2000 )": " degree32′04″", "rn": 2 }

3) Count of globular clusters in the table (for context)
Executed SQL:
select count(*) from list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 where lower("object type") = 'globular cluster';

Result: 1

Conclusion
- Based on the stored declination ( j2000 ) text values, the item in rank 2 is indeed a globular cluster (NGC 5466). This supports the claim that “globular cluster have the second highest declination ( j2000 ) in the list.”

Important caveat grounded in the data
- The declination column is stored as text strings like " degree32′04″" (appearing to omit sign and the degree value), so the ranking above is purely lexicographic by the stored text, not by properly parsed numeric declination. The claim, as verified here, holds under ordering by the column as it exists in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “The list” refers to public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 in the discovered database.
- “Second highest declination ( j2000 )” means second in descending order of the stored text values of the declination column, since the field is textual and cannot be reliably converted to numeric angles without additional information.
