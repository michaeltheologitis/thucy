Data sources discovered:
- TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema, with one table: public.t_1983_84_fa_cup (columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"). No other data sources were available.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify any Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton matches in the available dataset.
- Executed SQL (exact-string, case-sensitive attempt):
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "away team", "score", "date"
FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup
WHERE ("home team" = 'Sheffield Wednesday' AND "away team" = 'Southampton')
   OR ("home team" = 'Southampton' AND "away team" = 'Sheffield Wednesday');
Result: No rows (indicates the table stores team names with different casing/formatting).

- Executed SQL (case-insensitive match):
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "away team", "score", "date"
FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup
WHERE ("home team" ILIKE '%Sheffield%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%Southampton%')
   OR ("home team" ILIKE '%Southampton%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%Sheffield%');
Results:
- tie no: 2 | home team: sheffield wednesday | away team: southampton | score: 0 - 0 | date: 11 march 1984
- tie no: replay | home team: southampton | away team: sheffield wednesday | score: 5 - 1 | date: 20 march 1984

Conclusion based on data:
- There is a recorded Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton match in the dataset with the score 0 - 0 (11 March 1984, FA Cup 1983–84). Therefore, the claim that “the score of the Sheffield Wednesday versus Southampton game be 0 - 0” is supported by the available data (for that specific fixture/date).

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The available dataset only covers FA Cup 1983–84 matches. I interpreted “the game” as referring to a Sheffield Wednesday vs Southampton match within this dataset. I am not asserting anything about other seasons or competitions outside the provided data sources.
