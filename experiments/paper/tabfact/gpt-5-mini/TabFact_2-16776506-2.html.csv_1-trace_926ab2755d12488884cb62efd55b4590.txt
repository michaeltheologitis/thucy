Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.
- Explored schema and found a relevant table: public.leanne_baker, which includes a surface column and a date column.
- Queried records for the year 1999 and then retrieved the full record for 2 May 1999 to verify the surface type.

Data source discovery
- Result: One accessible database: TabFact (schema: public).

Relevant schema
- Table: public.leanne_baker
  - Columns: outcome (text), date (text), location (text), surface (text), "opponent in final" (text), score (text)

Evidence 1: Find all 1999 entries and their surfaces
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, surface FROM leanne_baker WHERE date LIKE '%1999%';
- Result:
  - 2 may 1999 | hard
  - 11 july 1999 | grass
- Interpretation: There is a record for 2 may 1999 with surface = hard.

Evidence 2: Retrieve the full record for 2 May 1999
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM leanne_baker WHERE date ILIKE '%2 May 1999%';
- Result:
  - outcome: winner
  - date: 2 may 1999
  - location: coatzacoalcos , mexico
  - surface: hard
  - opponent in final: candice jairala
  - score: 3 - 6 6 - 3 7 - 5
- Interpretation: Confirms the surface for the event on 2 May 1999 is "hard".

Conclusion
- The claim "on 2 may 1999, the surface be hard" is supported by the data in the leanne_baker table. The record for that date explicitly lists surface = hard.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the tennis event recorded in the public.leanne_baker table on 2 May 1999, and “surface” refers to the court surface type recorded in that dataset.
- Date values are stored as text and matched case-insensitively, hence the use of ILIKE in one query.
