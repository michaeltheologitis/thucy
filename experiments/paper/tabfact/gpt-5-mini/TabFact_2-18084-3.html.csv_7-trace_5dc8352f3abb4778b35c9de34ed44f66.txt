Claim to verify: “4 athlete have a mark of 28 foot.”

Data sources discovered
- One PostgreSQL database (TabFact, connection: postgres_tabfact9), schema public, table: long_jump.

Relevant table schema
- public.long_jump columns: mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text). No primary key.

Step 1 — Inspect how marks are recorded
Purpose: Understand the formatting of the mark field to interpret “28 foot”.
Executed SQL and evidence:
1) SQL:
SELECT mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, date FROM public.long_jump LIMIT 20;
Observed sample rows include formats like “8.95 m (29ft4¼in)”, “8.74 m (28ft8in)”, indicating marks are stored as metric followed by a parenthetical feet/inches.

2) SQL:
SELECT mark, COUNT(*) AS freq FROM public.long_jump GROUP BY mark ORDER BY freq DESC LIMIT 50;
Evidence: Confirms recurring format with parenthetical feet/inches; examples include “8.74 m (28ft8in)”, “8.73 m (28ft7½in)”, etc.

Step 2 — Test strict interpretation: exactly 28 feet 0 inches
Interpretation A: “28 foot” means exactly 28ft0in.
Executed SQL and result:
3) SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS num_athletes FROM public.long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft0in)%';
Result: num_athletes = 0
Conclusion under Interpretation A: 0 athletes, not 4.

Step 3 — Test inclusive interpretation: any 28-foot mark (28ft0in up to 28ft11¾in)
Interpretation B: “28 foot” means any parenthetical starting with 28ft (i.e., in the 28‑foot range, inches can vary).
Executed SQL and results:
4) SQL (simple pattern match):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS num_athletes FROM public.long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft%';
Result: num_athletes = 6

5) SQL (list matching athletes and marks):
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, mark FROM public.long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft%';
Result rows:
- dwight phillips — 8.74 m (28ft8in)
- erick walder — 8.74 m (28ft8in) a
- irving saladino — 8.73 m (28ft7½in)
- iván pedroso — 8.71 m (28ft6¾in)
- larry myricks — 8.74 m (28ft8in)
- loúis tsátoumas — 8.66 m (28ft4¾in)

6) SQL (case-insensitive, more robust regex within parentheses):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athlete_count FROM public.long_jump WHERE mark ~* '\\([^)]*28\\s*ft[^)]*\\)';
Result: distinct_athlete_count = 6

7) SQL (case-insensitive list, via regex):
SELECT DISTINCT athlete FROM public.long_jump WHERE mark ~* '\\([^)]*28\\s*ft[^)]*\\)';
Result athletes:
- dwight phillips
- erick walder
- irving saladino
- iván pedroso
- larry myricks
- loúis tsátoumas
Conclusion under Interpretation B: 6 athletes, not 4.

Overall conclusion
- The claim “4 athlete have a mark of 28 foot” is not supported by the data in public.long_jump.
- If “28 foot” means exactly 28ft0in, the count is 0.
- If “28 foot” means any 28‑foot range mark, the count is 6.
- In both reasonable interpretations, the data contradicts the claim of 4.

Assumptions noted
- I treated “28 foot” as either exactly 28ft0in or any mark whose parenthetical feet/inches begins with 28ft.
- Matching accounted for possible spacing/case variations using a case‑insensitive regex.
- Verification is grounded in the public.long_jump table of the TabFact database; no other tables were available.
