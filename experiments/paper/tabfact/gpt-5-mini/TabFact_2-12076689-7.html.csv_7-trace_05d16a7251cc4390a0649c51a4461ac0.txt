Claim to verify: “the final game score be 8 - 3 in 2 different game of the 2007 season.”

Summary of available data
- I enumerated the available tables in the connected database and found only a single table for the Texas Rangers 2006 season. There is no 2007-season table available, so I cannot directly verify a 2007-season claim from the accessible data.

Evidence: data source discovery
- SQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_name;
- Result: t_2006_texas_rangers_season

Given the lack of 2007 data, I examined the closest available data (Texas Rangers 2006 season) to see how often a final score of 8 - 3 occurred, as a sanity check.

Evidence: data format and content checks
1) Preview of rows to understand score format
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 20;
- Result: Scores appear as “number - number”, e.g., “8 - 1”, “11 - 3”, etc. (sample shows many such rows)

2) Distinct score strings
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT score FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season ORDER BY score;
- Result includes: …, 8 - 1, 8 - 3, … (confirming 8 - 3 exists in 2006 data)

3) Normalized score pattern
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT regexp_replace(score, '\d+', '#', 'g') AS pattern FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season ORDER BY pattern;
- Result: # - # (uniform format)

Evidence: frequency of 8 - 3 in the available table (2006)
1) Count of 8 - 3 games
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE regexp_replace(score, '\s+', '', 'g') = '8-3';
- Result: 1

2) Details of 8 - 3 games
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, score FROM t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE regexp_replace(score, '\s+', '', 'g') = '8-3' ORDER BY date;
- Result: september 25 | angels | 8 - 3

Conclusion
- The connected database does not contain any 2007-season table, so I cannot verify whether there were two different 8–3 final scores in the 2007 season from the available evidence. Within the only accessible season (Texas Rangers 2006), there was exactly one game with a final score of 8 - 3.

Assumptions
- I assumed the user’s claim pertains to MLB game results and, given the available table, to Texas Rangers season data. If you provide or connect a 2007-season dataset, I can re-run the verification specifically for 2007.
