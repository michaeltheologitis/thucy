Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve 1999 row

SQL executed:
SELECT year, first,
       regexp_replace(first, '\s*[-–—]\s*.*$', '') AS first_name,
       trim(substring(first from '[-–—]\s*(.*)$')) AS country_part
FROM public.cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE year = 1999;
Result:
{ "year": 1999, "first": "antonio pompa - baldi italy", "first_name": "antonio pompa", "country_part": "baldi italy" }

3) Extract country as the last token of trailing text
SQL executed:
SELECT year, first,
       regexp_replace(first, '\s*[-–—]\s*.*$', '') AS first_name,
       trim(substring(first from '[-–—]\s*(.*)$')) AS country_part,
       split_part(trim(substring(first from '[-–—]\s*(.*)$')), ' ', 2) AS country_only

WHERE year = 1999;
Result:
