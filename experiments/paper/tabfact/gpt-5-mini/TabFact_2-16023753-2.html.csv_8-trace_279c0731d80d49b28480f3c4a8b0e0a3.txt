Claim: “the lowest attendance figure for a 1983 Dolphins game [is] 39434.”

Finding 1 — Actual minimum attendance in the 1983 season:
- Evidence query:
  SQL: SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
  Result: min_attendance = 32343

- Evidence query (games matching that minimum):
  SQL: SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season WHERE attendance = 32343 ORDER BY week;
  Result row:
  - week: 8, date: october 23 , 1983, opponent: baltimore colts, result: w 21 - 7, attendance: 32343

Finding 2 — Where 39434 appears in the data (to check the claim value):
- Evidence query (lowest attendances):
  SQL: SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY attendance ASC NULLS LAST LIMIT 5;
  Results:
  - week: 8, date: october 23 , 1983, opponent: baltimore colts, result: w 21 - 7, attendance: 32343
  - week: 14, date: december 4 , 1983, opponent: houston oilers, result: w 24 - 17, attendance: 39434

Conclusion:
- The lowest attendance for a 1983 Miami Dolphins game in the available dataset is 32,343 (Week 8 vs. Baltimore Colts), not 39,434. The 39,434 figure corresponds to Week 14 vs. Houston Oilers and is not the minimum.

Assumptions:
- “Game” refers to regular-season games contained in the table public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season. The table does not include a location field; analysis considered all listed games regardless of home/away. MIN() ignores NULLs; none affected the computed minimum.
