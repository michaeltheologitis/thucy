Claim to verify: "mobilis be from algeria with 7476 subscriber in 2006"

What I looked for:
- A record for the provider Mobilis in Algeria and its 2006 subscriber count.
- Clarification of the unit used for the subscriber figures in the data.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: mobile_telephony_in_africa
- Columns: provider (text), country (text), "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" (bigint), "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" (bigint), "growth %" (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Case-insensitive search to locate the Mobilis/Algeria row and 2006 value
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE '%Mobilis%' AND country ILIKE '%Algeria%';
Result:
- provider: mobilis
- country: algeria
- subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476  (i.e., 7,476,000 subscribers)

2) Exact match using lowercase values to retrieve the full row (confirming units and context)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider = 'mobilis' AND country = 'algeria';
Result:
- provider: mobilis
- country: algeria
- subscribers (2005) (thousands): 4908
- subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476
- growth %: 52

(For transparency, an earlier exact match with initial capitalization returned no rows because values in the table are lowercase.)
SQL that returned no rows:
SELECT * FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider = 'Mobilis' AND country = 'Algeria';
SELECT * FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE country = 'Algeria';

Assessment:
- The table explicitly labels the 2006 subscriber field as "subscribers (2006) (thousands)". The value for Mobilis in Algeria is 7476, meaning 7,476 thousand subscribers (7.476 million) in 2006.
- The claim’s country/operator association is correct: Mobilis is listed under Algeria.
- The numeric figure "7476" matches the dataset’s value, but the claim omits the "thousands" unit and says "subscriber" (singular), which could be misinterpreted as 7,476 total subscribers instead of 7,476 thousand.

Conclusion:
- The data supports that Mobilis (Algeria) had 7476 thousand subscribers in 2006. The claim is numerically aligned but missing the unit.

Assumptions made:
- I interpret the user’s "7476 subscriber" as intending the figure shown in the data, which is stored in thousands. The correct interpretation is 7,476 thousand subscribers (7.476 million) in 2006.
- I treated the discovered database as authoritative per the instructions.
