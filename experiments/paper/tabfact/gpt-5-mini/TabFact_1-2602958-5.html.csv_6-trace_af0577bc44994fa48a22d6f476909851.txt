Claim interpreted: Whether Amy Sherman-Palladino directed exactly one Gilmore Girls episode that originally aired in 2003.

Evidence from the available data source (TabFact Postgres, public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes):

1) Retrieve episodes in 2003 directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no", title, director, "original air date" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%2003%' AND director ~* 'Amy.*Sherman[-–—\s]*Palladino';
- Result:
[{"no":66,"title":"ballrooms and biscotti","director":"amy sherman - palladino","original air date":"september 23 , 2003"}]

2) Count of such episodes
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%2003%' AND director ~* 'Amy.*Sherman[-–—\s]*Palladino';
- Result:
[{"count":1}]

3) Context: All Gilmore Girls episodes with original air date in 2003
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no", title, director, "original air date" 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%2003%'
ORDER BY "no" ASC;
- Result (episode no — title — director — original air date):
66 — ballrooms and biscotti — amy sherman - palladino — september 23 , 2003

Conclusion:
- The database shows exactly one episode in 2003 with Amy Sherman-Palladino credited as director: Episode 66, "ballrooms and biscotti," originally aired September 23, 2003. The count query confirms there was only one such episode in 2003.

Assumptions:
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (Gilmore Girls episodes). Names were matched case-insensitively and allowed for different hyphen/dash spacing between "Sherman" and "Palladino." Year filtering relied on the "original air date" text containing "2003."
