Claim to verify: “john gadret on the ag2r prévoyance team score 15 uci point.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data sources: TabFact (Postgres) with public schema
- Identified relevant table: public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya with columns (cyclist, country, team, time, uci points)

Evidence from data
1) Locate John Gadret’s entry and retrieve team and UCI points
Executed SQL:
SELECT cyclist, team, "uci points" FROM t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE cyclist ILIKE '%gadret%';

Result:
- cyclist: john gadret
- team: ag2r prévoyance
- uci points: 15

Assessment
- The row explicitly lists “john gadret” with team “ag2r prévoyance” and “uci points” equal to 15. This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data in the available table.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The available data pertains to the table t_2007_volta_a_catalunya (which appears to record results for the 2007 Volta a Catalunya). The claim was matched against this dataset. No broader season-wide UCI totals were available; verification is specific to this race dataset and its recorded UCI points.
