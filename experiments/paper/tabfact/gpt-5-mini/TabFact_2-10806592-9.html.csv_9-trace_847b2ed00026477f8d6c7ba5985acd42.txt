Claim to verify: “2 home team have the same score as the away team that they be play.” Interpreted as: In the available match data, there are exactly 2 matches where the home team’s total points equal the away team’s total points (i.e., two draws).

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact8 (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1938_vfl_season
  Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

What “same score” means in this dataset
- Scores are stored in the format goals.behinds (total), e.g., “11.23 (89)”. A draw occurs when the integers inside the parentheses (total points) are equal for home and away.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Context: list all rows to see the score format
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Result (6 rows):
- geelong 11.23 (89) vs hawthorn 6.13 (49)
- fitzroy 16.12 (108) vs south melbourne 8.8 (56)
- st kilda 14.12 (96) vs melbourne 16.16 (112)
- richmond 15.14 (104) vs essendon 15.9 (99)
- footscray 13.9 (87) vs collingwood 10.5 (65)
- north melbourne 11.5 (71) vs carlton 16.25 (121)

2) Per-match extraction of total points and equality check
SQL:
select "home team","home team score",
       replace(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')','') as h_total,
       "away team","away team score",
       replace(split_part("away team score",'(',2),')','') as a_total,
       (replace(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')','') = replace(split_part("away team score",'(',2),')','')) as totals_equal
from public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Results (totals_equal is false for every row):
- 89 vs 49 → false
- 108 vs 56 → false
- 96 vs 112 → false
- 104 vs 99 → false
- 87 vs 65 → false
- 71 vs 121 → false

3) Aggregate count of draws (equal total points)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_1938_vfl_season;
Result: total_rows = 6

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS equal_total_points_rows
FROM t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" LIKE '%(%' AND "away team score" LIKE '%(%'
  AND (replace(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',''))::int = (replace(split_part("away team score",'(',2),')',''))::int;
Result: equal_total_points_rows = 0

Conclusion based on data
- The table contains 6 matches, and none have equal total points. Therefore, the claim that “2” such matches exist is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Same score” refers to equal total points shown inside parentheses in the score strings (the conventional way to identify draws in this sport).
- The claim pertains to the available table public.t_1938_vfl_season; no other match tables are present in the accessible data environment.
