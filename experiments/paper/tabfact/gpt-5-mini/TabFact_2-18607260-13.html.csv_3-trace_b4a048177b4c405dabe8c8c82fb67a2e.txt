Claim interpreted: Neither team scored in the first two games of the World Cup in France (interpreted as the Paraguay national team’s first two matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup, hosted by France).

What the data shows:
- The only available dataset is a 1998 Paraguayan football table. It includes Paraguay’s matches at the 1998 World Cup (France), with dates, venues, and scores.
- Ordering Paraguay’s World Cup matches by date shows the first two ended 0-0.

Executed SQL and evidence:
1) SQL executed:
SELECT date, comp, venue, score, report FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%' OR comp ILIKE '%FIFA%' OR comp ILIKE '%France%' OR comp ILIKE '%1998%' ORDER BY date ASC;

Results (relevant rows in chronological order):
- 1998 - 06 - 12 | comp: world cup | venue: stade de la mosson montpellier , france | score: 0 - 0
- 1998 - 06 - 19 | comp: world cup | venue: stade geoffroy - guichard saint - étienne , france | score: 0 - 0

- 1998 - 06 - 28 | comp: world cup | venue: stade félix bollaert lens , france | score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )

Assessment:
- The first two World Cup fixtures listed for Paraguay (12 June and 19 June 1998, in France) both have scores of 0-0, meaning neither team scored in those matches.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data for Paraguay at the 1998 FIFA World Cup (hosted in France).

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “world cup in france” refers to the 1998 FIFA World Cup hosted by France.
- The claim pertains specifically to the Paraguay national team’s matches, since the only accessible data source is “1998 in Paraguayan football.”
