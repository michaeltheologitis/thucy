Claim: “there be no country that have 4 bronze medal.”

Data source explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact7 (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_1967_world_judo_championships with columns [rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total]

What I checked
- Whether any nation in this table has exactly 4 bronze medals.

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) List nations with exactly 4 bronze medals
SQL:
SELECT nation, bronze FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE bronze = 4 ORDER BY nation;
Result:
[{"nation": "japan", "bronze": 4}]

2) Count how many nations have exactly 4 bronze medals
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_nations_with_4_bronze FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE bronze = 4;
Result:
[{"num_nations_with_4_bronze": 1}]

3) Full medal breakdown for nation(s) with exactly 4 bronze medals
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE bronze = 4 ORDER BY nation;
Result:
[{"nation": "japan", "gold": 5, "silver": 3, "bronze": 4, "total": 12}]

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. At least one country (Japan) has exactly 4 bronze medals in this dataset.

Assumptions made
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the only available dataset: the 1967 World Judo Championships medal table (public.t_1967_world_judo_championships). No other competitions or years were available in the connected data sources.
