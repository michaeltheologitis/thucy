Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database TabFact (public schema)
- Table identified: public.smallville_season_9

Schema snapshot of public.smallville_season_9
- Columns: no (bigint), - (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), us air date (text), production code (text), us viewers (million) (double precision)

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve all rows where Wayne Rose is listed as director
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "directed by" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Wayne Rose%';
Result:
- title: echo; directed by: wayne rose

2) Count how many rows list Wayne Rose as director
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Wayne Rose%';
Result:
- count: 1

Conclusion
- The table contains exactly one row where the director is Wayne Rose, and the corresponding title is "echo". This supports the claim that Wayne Rose has (directed) only one title in the table, which is Echo.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted "direct" as the "directed by" column.
- Interpreted "title echo" as the row where title equals "echo" (case-insensitive matching used for director name).
