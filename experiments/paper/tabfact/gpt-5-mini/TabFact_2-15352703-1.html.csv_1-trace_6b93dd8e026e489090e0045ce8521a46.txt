Claim interpreted: “Arizona be the college who have the last draft pick.” I interpret this as asking whether the last (highest pick number) draft pick in the available dataset has “Arizona” as the player’s college.

Data environment discovered:
- Only one accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season (columns: round, pick, player, position, college)

Step 1: Identify the last (highest pick number) in the table and its college
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, round, pick, college FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE pick = (SELECT MAX(pick) FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season);

Result:
- player: al edwards
- round: 11
- pick: 293
- college: northwestern state , la

Step 2: Check whether any pick in this table lists a college containing “arizona”
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, pick, round, college
FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season
WHERE college ILIKE '%arizona%'
ORDER BY pick ASC;

Results:
- player: glenn parker, pick: 70, round: 3, college: arizona
- player: john nies, pick: 155, round: 6, college: arizona

Step 3: (Context) Table size
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season;

Result:
- total_rows: 12

Conclusion based on available data:
- The last (highest pick number) entry in this dataset is pick 293 (al edwards) from “northwestern state , la,” not Arizona. While two earlier picks list Arizona as the college, the final/last pick does not. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data available.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- Ambiguous term “last draft pick” is interpreted as the row with the maximum value in the pick column within the only accessible table (1990 Buffalo Bills season data). If the intent was to refer to a different draft (e.g., league-wide last pick in a given year), those data are not present in the accessible source; the conclusion here pertains strictly to the provided dataset.
