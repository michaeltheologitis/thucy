Interpretation of the claim: Within the accessible TabFact database, we interpret “the us open have the same result in the year 1986 and 1999” as referring to Katrina Adams’ results at the US Open in those years. We verify whether her entries for 1986 and 1999 are identical.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named public.katrina_adams.

Schema used:
- Table: public.katrina_adams
  - Columns: tournament (text), "1986" (text), "1988" (text), "1989" (text), "1990" (text), "1991" (text), "1992" (text), "1993" (text), "1994" (text), "1995" (text), "1996" (text), "1997" (text), "1998" (text), "1999" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all tournaments with 1986 and 1999 entries:
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams ORDER BY tournament;
Result (relevant row shown):
- tournament: us open — 1986: 1r — 1999: 1r

2) Explicitly compare the US Open entries for 1986 and 1999:
SQL:
SELECT "1986" AS year_1986, "1999" AS year_1999, ("1986" = "1999") AS same FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'us open';
Result:
- year_1986: 1r — year_1999: 1r — same: true

Conclusion based on data:
- In the public.katrina_adams table, Katrina Adams’ US Open result is “1r” in both 1986 and 1999. Therefore, the results are the same for those years in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The table records Katrina Adams’ performances by tournament and year. We assumed the claim refers to her US Open results. If the claim instead intended the overall tournament champions or other events (e.g., golf’s U.S. Open), that is outside the scope of this accessible dataset. All conclusions are grounded strictly in the data available here.
