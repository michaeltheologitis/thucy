Claim to verify: “12.8 be 1 of the milepost list for the location rockland.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact20 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table identified: massachusetts_route_139 with columns: county (text), location (text), street names (text), milepost (text), roads intersected (text), notes (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve all rows where location includes Rockland and inspect mileposts
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Rockland%';
- Result (abridged):
  - {county: "plymouth", location: "rockland", milepost: "12.2", street names: "north avenue plain street market street", roads intersected: "route 123", notes: "western terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency"}
  - {county: "plymouth", location: "rockland", milepost: "12.8", street names: "north avenue plain street market street", roads intersected: "route 123", notes: "eastern terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency"}
- Interpretation: For Rockland, the table lists mileposts 12.2 and 12.8.

2) Confirm numeric equality to 12.8 (handling text storage of milepost)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Rockland%' AND milepost ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' AND CAST(milepost AS numeric) = 12.8;
- Result: One row matches (milepost = "12.8"), same row as above.
- Interpretation: There is a Rockland row whose milepost is numerically 12.8.

3) Check textual containment of "12.8" in milepost
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Rockland%' AND milepost ILIKE '%12.8%';
- Result: One row matches (milepost = "12.8").
- Interpretation: The milepost list for Rockland includes the text "12.8".

Conclusion
- The data show that for location Rockland in the massachusetts_route_139 table, 12.8 is indeed one of the milepost values (alongside 12.2). This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Location rockland” refers to rows where the location column equals/contains “rockland” (case-insensitive) in the massachusetts_route_139 table.
- “Be 1 of the milepost list” means there exists at least one row for Rockland whose milepost value equals 12.8 (as text and as numeric).
- The massachusetts_route_139 table is the authoritative source for this route/location’s milepost listings within the accessible data.
