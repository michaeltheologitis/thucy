Claim assessed: "Qatar be rank 8th in the Middle East for GDP."

Finding:
- In the available authoritative dataset (TabFact, table: public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp), Qatar’s Middle East GDP rank is 5, not 8, based on 2011 GDP (PPP) values.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Direct lookup of Qatar’s Middle East rank
- SQL:
  SELECT country, "rank mideast", "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" 
  FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp 
  WHERE country ILIKE '%qatar%';
- Result:
  country = 'qatar', rank mideast = 5, 2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd = 181.912

2) Context: Top 10 Middle East GDP (PPP) ranks in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT "rank mideast", country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd"
  FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
  WHERE "rank mideast" IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY "rank mideast" ASC
  LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt:
  1 — iran — 930.236
  2 — saudi arabia — 677.663
  3 — united arab emirates — 261.189
  4 — israel — 235.446

  8 — syria — 107.803
  9 — oman — 81.005
  10 — yemen — 63.344

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows Qatar ranked 5th in the Middle East by GDP (PPP) for 2011, not 8th. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data available.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- GDP measure is GDP (PPP) as provided by the table column "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd".
- Year is 2011, the only year present in the table.
- "Middle East" membership and ranks are taken directly from the table’s "rank mideast" field as authoritative for this dataset.
