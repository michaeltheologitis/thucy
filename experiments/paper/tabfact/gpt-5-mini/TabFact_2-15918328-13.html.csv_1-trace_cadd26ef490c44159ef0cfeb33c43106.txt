Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: There is one routine with a “safe” result that was choreographed by Jason Gilkison to the music “Filet” from Le Rêve.
- Data source explored: postgres_tabfact21 public schema, which contains a table for So You Think You Can Dance U.S. Season 4.

Schema discovery
- Available table: so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4(couple text, style text, music text, "choreographer (s)" text, results text).

Findings
- The Season 4 table contains an entry for Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performing a Paso Doble to “filet from le rêve,” choreographed by Jason Gilkison, with results marked “safe.”
- Counting matching entries confirms exactly one such row.

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Locate all rows with choreographer including Jason Gilkison
Executed SQL:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%Jason Gilkison%';
Results:
- couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura | style: viennese waltz | music: the time of my life - david cook | choreographer (s): jason gilkison | results: kanemura eliminated
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: paso doble | music: filet from le rêve | choreographer (s): jason gilkison | results: safe

2) Filter specifically for music containing “filet” and choreographer including Jason Gilkison
Executed SQL:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE music ILIKE '%filet%'
  AND "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%Jason Gilkison%';
Results:
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: paso doble | music: filet from le rêve | choreographer (s): jason gilkison | results: safe

3) Count rows matching choreographer includes Jason Gilkison, music contains “filet,” and results marked “safe”
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%Jason Gilkison%'
  AND music ILIKE '%filet%'
  AND results ILIKE '%safe%';
Result:
- count: 1

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one Season 4 routine choreographed by Jason Gilkison to “filet from le rêve” with results marked “safe.” This supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions
- “Safe result” corresponds to the results column containing the value “safe.”
- The claim refers to the Season 4 dataset available in the connected data source.
- Case-insensitive substring matching (ILIKE) is appropriate for identifying the music title and choreographer name.
