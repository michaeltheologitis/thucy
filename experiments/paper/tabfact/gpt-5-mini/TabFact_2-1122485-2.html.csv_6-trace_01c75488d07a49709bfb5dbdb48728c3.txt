Claim interpreted: “Suspension trouble is the most common issue affecting outcomes (time/retired) in the available data.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid)
- The column “time / retired” records either a finisher’s time/gap or a retirement reason.

Method
- Identify retirement reasons by excluding finisher times/gaps and the literal value ‘Finished’. Specifically exclude:
  - Values containing a colon “:” (typical time format)
  - Purely numeric values
  - Values starting with ‘+’ (finish gaps like “+ 1 lap”, “+ 20.9”)
  - The exact string ‘Finished’
- Count occurrences of each remaining value and determine the most frequent reason.

Executed SQL (counts of retirement reasons)
SELECT trim("time / retired") AS reason, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE trim("time / retired") NOT LIKE '%:%'
  AND trim("time / retired") !~ '^[0-9]+$'
  AND trim("time / retired") <> 'Finished'
  AND trim("time / retired") NOT LIKE '+%'
GROUP BY reason
ORDER BY count DESC, reason ASC;

Result
- engine: 4
- overheating: 2
- accident: 1
- differential: 1
- fuel leak: 1
- gearbox: 1
- physical: 1
- suspension: 1

Executed SQL (is ‘Suspension’ the most common?)
WITH counts AS (
  SELECT trim("time / retired") AS reason, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  WHERE trim("time / retired") NOT LIKE '%:%'
    AND trim("time / retired") !~ '^[0-9]+$'
    AND trim("time / retired") <> 'Finished'
    AND trim("time / retired") NOT LIKE '+%'
  GROUP BY reason
)
SELECT (SELECT cnt FROM counts WHERE lower(reason) = 'suspension') AS suspension_count,
       (SELECT MAX(cnt) FROM counts) AS max_count;

Result
- suspension_count = 1
- max_count = 4

Findings
- The most common retirement reason in this dataset is “engine” (4 occurrences).
- “suspension” appears once. Therefore, “suspension trouble” is not the most common issue in the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the most common retirement reason within the available table (1971 South African Grand Prix) using the “time / retired” column.
- Finish times/gaps were filtered using reasonable heuristics (exclude ‘Finished’, colon-containing times, purely numeric entries, and strings starting with ‘+’). Results are specific to this race and do not generalize beyond the available table.
