Claim to verify:
- "active from 1947 - 1964 , titus ozon score 157 goal"

Data source discovery:
- Connected data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact32), schema: public
- Available table used: public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country (columns: rank, name, years, matches, goals)

Evidence collected:
1) Search for Titus Ozon in the relevant table
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE name ILIKE '%Titus Ozon%';

Result:
- rank: 10
- name: titus ozon
- years: 1947 - 1964
- matches: 270
- goals: 157

Assessment against the claim:
- Active years: The table lists "years: 1947 - 1964" for Titus Ozon, matching the claim "active from 1947 - 1964".
- Goals: The table lists "goals: 157" for Titus Ozon, matching the claim "score 157 goal".

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are directly supported by the data returned from the database query above.

Assumptions made:
- "Active from 1947 - 1964" is interpreted as the "years" field shown for Titus Ozon in the table.
- "score 157 goal" is interpreted as the "goals" field for Titus Ozon in the same table. The claim does not specify competition scope, and the table appears to summarize player totals relevant to its context; this verification accepts that scope as authoritative for this claim.
