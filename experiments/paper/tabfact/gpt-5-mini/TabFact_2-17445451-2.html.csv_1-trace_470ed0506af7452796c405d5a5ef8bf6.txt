Claim interpreted: “TKO (cut) was the method in Round 1 at the UFC 20 event.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table: fabiano_iha. Columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time.

Evidence retrieval:
- Query to find any Fabiano Iha fight entries at UFC 20 and inspect the method and round.

SQL query executed:
SELECT opponent, method, round, time, res, event
FROM public.fabiano_iha
WHERE event ILIKE '%UFC 20%';

Result:
- opponent: laverne clark
  method: tko (cut)
  round: 1
  time: 1:31
  res: loss
  event: ufc 20

Analysis:
- The record for Fabiano Iha at “ufc 20” shows that the fight ended via “tko (cut)” in Round 1. This directly supports the claim as phrased (that the method was TKO (cut) in Round 1 at UFC 20).

Conclusion: The data supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Available data covers Fabiano Iha’s fight history specifically. Therefore, the claim is interpreted as referring to Fabiano Iha’s bout at UFC 20, not to all fights on the UFC 20 card.
