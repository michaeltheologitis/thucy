Claim to verify: "Ettore Meini won 2 races in a row, on May 24 and 25, during the 1933 Giro d’Italia."

Summary conclusion: Supported by stage-level data for the 1933 Giro d’Italia. The records show Ettore Meini won on 24 May (Ferrara to Udine) and again on 25 May (Udine to Bassano del Grappa), i.e., two consecutive non-rest stages.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data environment: One PostgreSQL source (TabFact/postgres_tabfact12) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia (columns: date, course, distance, winner, race leader), representing stage-level information for the 1933 Giro d’Italia.

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Direct check of 24 May and 25 May stage winners
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, course, winner FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE date ILIKE '%24 May%' OR date ILIKE '%25 May%';
- Results:
  - 24 may — ferrara to udine — ettore meini ( ita )
  - 25 may — udine to bassano del grappa — ettore meini ( ita )

2) Confirming these were consecutive (back-to-back) non-rest stages with the same winner
- SQL executed:
WITH s AS (
  SELECT date, course, winner,
    lead(date) OVER (ORDER BY split_part(date,' ',1)::int) AS next_date,
    lead(winner) OVER (ORDER BY split_part(date,' ',1)::int) AS next_winner
  FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  WHERE lower(course) NOT LIKE '%rest%'
    AND lower(date) != 'total'
    AND lower(winner) NOT LIKE '%rest%'
)
SELECT date, course, winner, next_date, next_winner FROM s WHERE winner = next_winner;
- Pertinent result row:
  - 24 may | ferrara to udine | ettore meini ( ita ) -> next: 25 may | ettore meini ( ita )
- This confirms Meini’s wins occurred on consecutive non-rest stages (24 May immediately followed by 25 May).

Conclusion
- The data shows Ettore Meini won stages on both 24 May and 25 May, 1933, and these were consecutive stages. The claim is verified.

Assumptions
- The "date" field in t_1933_giro_d_italia (e.g., "24 may") refers to May 1933.
- "In a row" is interpreted as consecutive non-rest stages in chronological order.
- Rows labeled "rest day" and the final "total" row are not considered stages.
