Summary of finding
- The only relevant available data source is a TabFact PostgreSQL table for the 1975 Army Cadets (Black Knights) football season. It includes columns for date, opponent, the team’s points (“black knights points”), and the team’s record after each game.
- The row matching opponent “Lehigh” on “sept 20” shows Army scored 54 points and the post-game record listed is “2 - 0,” not “2 - 2.”

Direct evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Locate the Lehigh game in the 1975 Army table
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Lehigh%';

Result:
- game: 2
  date: sept 20
  opponent: lehigh
  result: win
  black knights points: 54
  opponents: 32
  record: 2 - 0

Conclusion
- True elements: Army (Black Knights) scored 54 points against Lehigh on September 20 and won 54–32.
- False element: The team’s record at that point was 2–0, not 2–2.

Answer: The claim that the Black Knights’ record was 2–2 when they scored 54 points against Lehigh on September 20 is contradicted by the data; it was 2–0.

Assumptions made
- “Black Knights” refers to Army’s football team (the 1975 Army Cadets/Black Knights table is the only relevant table available).
- “Record” refers to the team’s cumulative record immediately after that game, as presented in the table’s “record” column.
- The date formatting “sept 20” corresponds to September 20.
