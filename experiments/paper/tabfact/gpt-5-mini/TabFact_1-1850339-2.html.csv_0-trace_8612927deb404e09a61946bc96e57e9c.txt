Claim: "for the 2018 season, the air force - navy score be yet tbd"

Data source exploration:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema)
- Relevant table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy
  - Columns: season (bigint), trophy winner (text), air force - navy score (text), air force - army score (text), army - navy score (text)

Evidence 1: Direct lookup of Air Force - Navy score for 2018
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "air force - navy score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 2018;
- Result:
  {"air force - navy score": "tbd"}

Evidence 2: Full record for the 2018 season (context confirmation)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public."commander_in_chief_s_trophy" WHERE "season" = 2018;
- Result (key fields):
  season: 2018
  trophy winner: tbd
  air force - navy score: tbd
  air force - army score: tbd
  army - navy score: 8 dec 2018

Assessment:
- The table explicitly records the 2018 "air force - navy score" as "tbd", which supports the claim that the score was yet to be determined in this dataset for that season.

Assumptions:
- "yet tbd" is interpreted as the field value being the literal string "tbd" (to be determined).
- "2018 season" corresponds to the row where season = 2018 in the commander_in_chief_s_trophy table.
