Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that Sidney R. Yates (Illinois) was elected in 1964 as an incumbent from the Republican Party for Illinois’s 10th congressional district.

What the data shows:
- Available authoritative data source: TabFact PostgreSQL (public schema) containing a table of U.S. House election results for 1974. This table includes district names, incumbents, party, a “first elected” year for incumbents, and results. While the table is for 1974, it records each incumbent’s “first elected” year, which provides information about when the incumbent originally gained the seat they held in 1974.

Evidence 1 — Sidney R. Yates entry (1974 table):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", candidates, result
  FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  WHERE lower(incumbent) LIKE '%yates%' OR lower(candidates) LIKE '%yates%';
- Result:
  - district: illinois 9
  - incumbent: sidney r yates
  - party: democratic
  - first elected: 1964
  - candidates: sidney r yates (d) unopposed
  - result: re - elected
- Interpretation: The data shows Sidney R. Yates was the Democratic incumbent for Illinois 9 in 1974, and that he was first elected to that seat in 1964. This directly contradicts the claim that he was Republican and tied to Illinois 10 in that context. It also implies he was not an incumbent in 1964 (he first won the seat then), contradicting “elected as incumbent.”

Evidence 2 — Illinois 10th district entry (1974 table):
- Executed SQL (column check and row retrieval):
  1) Inspect columns:
     SELECT column_name, data_type
     FROM information_schema.columns
     WHERE table_name = 'united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974'
     ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  2) Retrieve the Illinois 10 row:
     SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", candidates, result
     FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
     WHERE district ILIKE '%illinois 10%';
- Result for Illinois 10:
  - district: illinois 10
  - incumbent: samuel h young
  - party: republican
  - first elected: 1972
  - candidates: abner j mikva (d) 50.9% samuel h young (r) 49.1%
  - result: lost re - election democratic gain
- Interpretation: In 1974, Illinois 10’s incumbent was Samuel H. Young (Republican), not Sidney R. Yates. This further undermines the association of Yates with Illinois 10.

Conclusion against each part of the claim:
- “Sidney R. Yates … from Republican party”: Inconsistent with data; Yates is listed as Democratic.
- “Illinois 10”: Inconsistent with data; Yates is associated with Illinois 9 (and Illinois 10 in 1974 was represented by Samuel H. Young, Republican).
- “be elect as incumbent in 1964”: Inconsistent with data; Yates’s “first elected” year is 1964, indicating he was not the incumbent in 1964 but first won the seat then.

Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “Illinois 10” as the 10th congressional district of Illinois and the claim as referring to the U.S. House of Representatives.
- Used the 1974 elections table’s “first elected” field to infer Yates’s initial victory year for the seat he held in 1974 (1964), which addresses the incumbent vs. first-time election status.
- The dataset does not include a 1964 election table, so the analysis relies on the 1974 table’s incumbent metadata (“first elected”) and cross-district comparisons within that same table.
