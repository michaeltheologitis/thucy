Claim to verify: “the detroit piston have their lowest game attendance during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season on march 20 against atlanta at the phillips arena.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact20), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record)

Key evidence from the data
1) What happened on March 20?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE date = 'march 20';
- Result:
  {"team":"atlanta","location attendance":"philips arena 17580"}
- Interpretation: On March 20, the opponent was Atlanta, and the venue/attendance string is “philips arena 17580,” i.e., attendance 17,580 at Philips Arena.

2) Lowest attendance in March (the relevant period implied by the dates around March in the table)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, team AS opponent,
         regexp_replace("location attendance", ' [0-9]+$', '') AS venue,
         substring("location attendance" from '[0-9]+$')::integer AS attendance
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%march%'
  ORDER BY attendance ASC
  LIMIT 1;
- Result:
  {"date":"march 1","opponent":"milwaukee","venue":"bradley center","attendance":11364}
- Cross-check (full ordered list for March):
  SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, "location attendance",
         regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS attendance
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE (date ILIKE '%Mar%' OR date ILIKE '%March%')
    AND regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> ''
  ORDER BY attendance ASC;
- Results (excerpt in ascending order):
  1) march 1 — bradley center 11364 — attendance 11364
  2) march 2 — the palace of auburn hills 13122 — attendance 13122
  3) march 16 — the palace of auburn hills 15166 — attendance 15166
  4) march 6 — the palace of auburn hills 17506 — attendance 17506
  5) march 20 — philips arena 17580 — attendance 17580
  ... (higher attendances follow)
- Conclusion for March: The lowest March attendance was 11,364 on March 1 vs Milwaukee at the Bradley Center, not March 20 vs Atlanta at Philips Arena (17,580).

3) Lowest attendance across the entire 2010–11 season (for completeness)
- SQL executed (find minimum attendance value):
  SELECT MIN((regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int) AS min_attendance
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
- Result:
  {"min_attendance":11364}
- SQL executed (retrieve the row(s) with that minimum):
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE (regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int = (
    SELECT MIN((regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int)
    FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  );
- Result:
  {"date":"march 1","game":62,"team":"milwaukee","score":"l 90 - 92 (ot)","high points":"rodney stuckey (25)","high rebounds":"greg monroe , charlie villanueva (9)","high assists":"rodney stuckey (5)","location attendance":"bradley center 11364","record":"22 - 40"}
- Conclusion for the season: The season’s lowest recorded attendance was 11,364 on March 1 vs Milwaukee at the Bradley Center.

Overall assessment based on the data
- The March 20 game vs Atlanta at Philips Arena had attendance 17,580 — this is not the lowest in March nor the season. The lowest in March (and the entire 2010–11 season) is March 1 vs Milwaukee at the Bradley Center with 11,364.
- Therefore, the claim that March 20 vs Atlanta at Philips Arena was the lowest attendance “during this period of the 2010–2011 season” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made (stated explicitly):
- “This period” refers to the March portion of the 2010–11 schedule as stored in the table (dates recorded as text like “march 1”).
- Column “team” indicates the opponent.
- Column “location attendance” stores venue name followed by the attendance number; attendance is the trailing integer extracted via regex.
- Spelling of the venue in the dataset is “philips arena” (without a double “l”).
