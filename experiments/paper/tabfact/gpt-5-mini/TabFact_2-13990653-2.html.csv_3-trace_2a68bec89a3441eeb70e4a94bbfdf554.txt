Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that there was a game against the Chinatrust Whales in which Pan Wei-Lun took the loss and Huang Chun-Chung recorded the save.

Data sources consulted
- PostgreSQL (TabFact project), public schema
- Table: t_2007_uni_president_lions_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, save)

Initial exploration to understand data format
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season LIMIT 10;
Key returned rows (relevant excerpts):
1) date: 3 / 17, opponent: la new bears, score: 4 - 5, loss: pan wei - lun, save: huang chun - chung
4) date: 3 / 23, opponent: chinatrust whales, score: 4 - 5, loss: pan wei - lun, save: miguel saladin
Observation: Names appear in lowercase with spaces around hyphens; the table indeed records losing and saving players per game.

Targeted verification queries
1) Did a Chinatrust Whales game exist where Pan Wei-Lun took the loss? If so, who got the save?
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent = 'chinatrust whales' AND loss = 'pan wei - lun';
Result:
[ {"date":"3 / 23","opponent":"chinatrust whales","score":"4 - 5","loss":"pan wei - lun","save":"miguel saladin"} ]
Finding: In the Chinatrust Whales game where Pan Wei-Lun was the losing pitcher, the save was credited to Miguel Saladin, not Huang Chun-Chung.

2) Did any game have both loss = Pan Wei-Lun and save = Huang Chun-Chung? If so, who was the opponent?
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss = 'pan wei - lun' AND save = 'huang chun - chung';
Result:
[ {"date":"3 / 17","opponent":"la new bears","score":"4 - 5","loss":"pan wei - lun","save":"huang chun - chung"} ]
Finding: The game with loss = Pan Wei-Lun and save = Huang Chun-Chung was against the La New Bears, not the Chinatrust Whales.

Conclusion
- The specific combination “opponent = Chinatrust Whales, loss = Pan Wei-Lun, save = Huang Chun-Chung” does not occur in the available data. When Pan Wei-Lun lost to the Chinatrust Whales (3/23), the save went to Miguel Saladin. When both Pan Wei-Lun (loss) and Huang Chun-Chung (save) appear together, the opponent was La New Bears (3/17).

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the 2007 Uni-President Lions season (the only relevant dataset available) and uses the exact name formatting found in the table (e.g., “pan wei - lun”, “huang chun - chung”, “chinatrust whales”).
