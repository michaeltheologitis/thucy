Claim to verify: “usc and clemson college have the most player draft at 3 each.”

Data sources discovered
- One accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public, with a single table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  - Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)
  - No year field; no keys or relationships.

Evidence
1) Top colleges by drafted-player count (as recorded in this table)
SQL executed:
SELECT college, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college
ORDER BY cnt DESC, college
LIMIT 20;

Result (excerpt):
- usc — 2
- clemson — 1
- georgia — 1
- kansas state — 1
- maryland — 1
- notre dame — 1
- tcu — 1
- temple — 1
- texas — 1
- texas a&m — 1
- texas tech — 1
- towson — 1

2) Maximum count across all colleges
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(cnt) AS max_count FROM (
  SELECT college, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  GROUP BY college
) AS sub;

Result:
- max_count: 2

3) Case-insensitive grouping check
SQL executed:
SELECT lower(college) AS college, count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY lower(college)
ORDER BY cnt DESC;

Result:
- usc: 2
- clemson: 1
- (all other listed colleges): 1 each

4) Rows for USC and Clemson (to confirm counts)
SQL executed:
SELECT name, round, pick, overall, college
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE lower(college) IN ('usc','clemson')
ORDER BY lower(college), overall;

Result rows:
- clemson — marvin sims, round 12, pick 19, overall 324
- usc — ray butler, round 4, pick 5, overall 88
- usc — chris foote, round 6, pick 6, overall 144

Findings
- In this dataset, USC has 2 drafted players and Clemson has 1. The maximum count for any college is 2, not 3. USC and Clemson are not tied for most, and neither has 3.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions and scope
- The only available data source is the Indianapolis Colts draft history table; therefore, “have the most player draft” is interpreted as “among players drafted by the Indianapolis Colts captured in this table.”
- College names were evaluated case-insensitively to avoid casing discrepancies.
- No year information is available in this table, so counts are over the full extent of the table’s contents.
