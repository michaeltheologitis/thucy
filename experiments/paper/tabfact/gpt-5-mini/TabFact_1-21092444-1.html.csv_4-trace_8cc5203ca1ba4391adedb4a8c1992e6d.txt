Summary of findings
- Available authoritative data covers the 1975 Army (then "Army Cadets") football season. In that dataset:
  - On Sept 27, Army played Villanova and lost 0–10. The team record after that game was 2–1.
  - Army played Penn State on Oct 25, not Sept 27, and lost 0–31. The team record after that game was 2–5.

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: "the black knight lose to penn state , whose record be 2 - 1 , on september 27th"
  - Date/opponent linkage: The data shows Penn State was not the Sept 27 opponent; Villanova was. This contradicts the claim.
  - Record 2–1 on Sept 27: The dataset shows Army’s record became 2–1 after the Sept 27 game. If the phrase “whose record be 2–1” refers to Army on that date, that part aligns with the data. If it refers to Penn State, we do not have Penn State’s record data in the available source to verify.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full 1975 Army schedule/results (used to identify the Sept 27 opponent and record):
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
ORDER BY game;
Key rows from the result:
- sept 27 — villanova — loss — Black Knights points: 0 — Opponents points: 10 — record: 2 - 1
- oct 25 — penn state — loss — Black Knights points: 0 — Opponents points: 31 — record: 2 - 5

2) Direct lookup of any Penn State game(s) in that season:
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points" AS army_points, opponents AS opponent_points, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Penn State%';
Result:
- date: oct 25; opponent: penn state; result: loss; army_points: 0; opponent_points: 31; record: 2 - 5

Conclusion
- The statement that Army (Black Knights) lost to Penn State on September 27 is contradicted by the data. They lost to Villanova on that date and to Penn State on October 25. The “2–1” record corresponds to Army’s record after the Sept 27 Villanova game, not to a Penn State game on that date.

Assumptions
- “Black Knight” refers to the Army Black Knights football team.
- The claim pertains to the 1975 season (the only available season in the connected authoritative dataset).
