Claim interpreted: “All but 1 season be about to have or have an Army–Navy game in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium).” I interpret this as referring to the seasons listed in the dataset that denote upcoming/scheduled Army–Navy game locations (future-oriented rows), and assessing how many of those are in Baltimore.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy(season, "trophy winner", "air force - navy score", "air force - army score", "army - navy score").

What the data contains:
- Historical seasons with Army–Navy numeric scores.
- Some future-oriented entries (e.g., 2014, 2016, 2018) where the "army - navy score" field contains dates/locations instead of a score.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect all rows to understand content and identify seasons with venue info in the Army–Navy field
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy ORDER BY season;
Key observations from the result:
- 2014: army - navy score = "13 dec 2014 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)"
- 2016: army - navy score = "10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)"
- 2018: army - navy score = "8 dec 2018" (no venue listed)

2) Explicitly list seasons >= 2014 and whether they mention Baltimore
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "army - navy score", ("army - navy score" ILIKE '%baltimore%') AS mentions_baltimore
FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy
WHERE season >= 2014
ORDER BY season;
Results:
- 2014 | 13 dec 2014 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium) | mentions_baltimore = true
- 2016 | 10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium) | mentions_baltimore = true
- 2018 | 8 dec 2018 | mentions_baltimore = false

3) Count seasons where Army–Navy field shows a scheduled location (contains “at”) and, among those, how many mention Baltimore
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_at_seasons FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE "army - navy score" ILIKE '% at %';
Result: total_at_seasons = 2

Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "army - navy score" FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE "army - navy score" ILIKE '% at %' ORDER BY season;
Result rows:
- 2014 | 13 dec 2014 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)
- 2016 | 10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS baltimore_count FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE "army - navy score" ILIKE '% at %' AND "army - navy score" ILIKE '%baltimore%';
Result: baltimore_count = 2

Conclusion based on data:
- Among the future/scheduled seasons present in this dataset (2014, 2016, 2018), two seasons (2014 and 2016) explicitly list Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium) as the Army–Navy venue, and one season (2018) does not list Baltimore (no venue text provided). This supports the interpretation that “all but 1 season” in this future-oriented subset are in Baltimore.

Assumptions made to interpret the claim:
- The phrase “be about to have or have” refers to the seasons in this dataset that denote upcoming/scheduled Army–Navy game locations in the "army - navy score" field (not the entire historical series of Army–Navy games).
- Only the data in the provided commander_in_chief_s_trophy table is considered authoritative; the claim is evaluated strictly within this dataset’s scope.
