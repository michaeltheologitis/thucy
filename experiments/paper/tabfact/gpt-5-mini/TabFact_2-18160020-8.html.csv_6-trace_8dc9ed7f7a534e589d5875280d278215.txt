Claim interpreted
- Interpreted as: In the available football dataset, Atlético Ciudad has a record showing 28 matches with an average strictly less than 0.61 (using the table’s “average” metric).

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact2) with one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (columns: goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team). This appears to be 2008–09 Segunda División B goalkeeper statistics by team.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate team spelling containing “ciudad”
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE team ILIKE '%ciudad%'
ORDER BY team;
Result:
[{"team":"atlético ciudad"}]

2) Retrieve rows for Atlético Ciudad
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, team, matches, average, goals
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE team ILIKE 'atlético ciudad';
Result:
[{"goalkeeper":"miguel zapata","team":"atlético ciudad","matches":28,"average":0.61,"goals":17}]

3) Test the strict condition matches = 28 AND average < 0.61 for that team
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE matches = 28
  AND average < 0.61
  AND team ILIKE '%ciudad%';
Result:
[{"cnt":0}]

Findings
- Atlético Ciudad appears once in the dataset, with matches = 28 and average = 0.61.
- The strict condition “average < 0.61” is not met (0.61 equals, not less than).

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported as stated. While 28 matches is correct, the average is 0.61, not less than 0.61.

Assumptions
- “Average” refers to the table’s average column (likely goals conceded per match for the goalkeeper) and was interpreted strictly as < 0.61, not ≤ 0.61.
- Team name variations were handled via case-insensitive matching; the stored team is “atlético ciudad.”
- The dataset represents the 2008–09 Segunda División B season and is treated as authoritative within its scope.
