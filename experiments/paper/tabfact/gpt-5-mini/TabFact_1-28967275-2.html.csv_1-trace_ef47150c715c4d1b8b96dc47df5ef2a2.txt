Summary conclusion: The data supports the claim. In the available database, series number 8 has production code 208.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL instance “TabFact / postgres_tabfact17” with a public schema.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct production codes for series = 8
- SQL:
  SELECT "production code", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 8 GROUP BY "production code" ORDER BY cnt DESC, "production code";
- Result:
  production code | cnt
  208             | 1
- Interpretation: For series 8, the only production code present is 208 (appears once).

2) Check explicitly whether 208 appears for series = 8
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_208 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 8 AND "production code" = 208;
- Result:
  cnt_208
  1
- Interpretation: Confirms production code 208 is present for series 8.

3) Full row(s) for series = 8
- SQL:
  SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 8 ORDER BY episode;
- Result (single row):
  episode: 34; series: 8; episode title: rocket 's decent; original air date: 27 april 2008; production code: 208
- Interpretation: The only row with series = 8 has production code 208.

Conclusion: The claim that “series number 8 have a production code of 208” is supported by the data in the authoritative table examined.

Assumptions:
- “series number 8” refers to rows where the column series = 8 in public.my_info_table.
- “production code” refers to the column named "production code" in the same table.
- The provided database is the authoritative context for this verification task.
