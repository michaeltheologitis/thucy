Claim to verify: “9 viral family have a replication site in the cytoplasm.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact, schema: public). No other sources were available via the provided tools.

Relevant schema identified
- Table: public.viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Verification approach
- Determine the distinct values present in replication site.
- Count distinct virus families whose replication site is cytoplasm.
- List the families for transparency.

Executed queries and results
1) Identify replication site values
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "replication site" FROM public.viral_disease ORDER BY "replication site";
Result:
- cytoplasm
- nucleus

2) Count distinct families with cytoplasmic replication
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS cytoplasm_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';
Result:
- cytoplasm_family_count: 14

3) List the distinct families with cytoplasmic replication
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm' ORDER BY family;
Result (families):
- arenaviridae
- astroviridae
- bunyaviridae
- caliciviridae
- coronaviridae
- filoviridae
- flaviviridae
- hepeviridae
- paramyxoviridae
- picornaviridae
- poxviridae
- reoviridae
- rhabdoviridae
- togaviridae

Cross-check using case-insensitive substring match (produced the same count)
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%cytoplasm%';
Result:
- family_count: 14

Conclusion
- The data show 14 distinct virus families with replication in the cytoplasm, not 9. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Viral family” refers to the distinct values in the family column of public.viral_disease.
- Replication site classification is taken as stored in the dataset (values observed: cytoplasm, nucleus).
