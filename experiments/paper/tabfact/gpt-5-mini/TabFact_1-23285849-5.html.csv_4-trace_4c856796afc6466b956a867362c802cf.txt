Visual count from these rows: Billups appears as the assists leader or co-leader in 10 of the 13 games (games 3,5,7,8,9,10,11,12,14,16).

Evidence 2: Aggregate counts confirming 10 of 13
- Query to list rows where Billups appears in high assists:
SQL:
SELECT game, "high assists" FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Chauncey%';
Result rows (games): 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16 (10 games)

- Total games in the table:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season;
Result: total_games = 13

- Count of games where Billups led or tied (name present in high assists):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS billups_lead_or_tie FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%chauncey billups%';
Result: billups_lead_or_tie = 10

- Of those, how many were ties (multiple names, detected by comma):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS billups_ties FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%chauncey billups%' AND "high assists" LIKE '%,%';
Result: billups_ties = 1

Interpretation
- Within this 13-game span (games 3–16 of the 2009–10 Nuggets season), Chauncey Billups led or co-led the team in assists in 10 games (9 sole leads, 1 tie). This aligns exactly with the claim “lead or be tie for the lead in assist for 10 out of 13 game.”

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted to refer to the 13-game segment present in the available table (games numbered 3–16 in November 2009 for the 2009–10 Denver Nuggets).
- “Lead or be tie for the lead in assist” is taken as Billups’ name appearing anywhere in the "high assists" field, which lists the team’s assist leader(s) for each game.
- Matching was done case-insensitively on the string "chauncey billups" and ties detected by the presence of a comma in the text field.
