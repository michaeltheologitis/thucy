Claim interpreted: The San Francisco 49ers lost 2 out of 14 games in the 1947 season.

Summary of findings from the data: The 49ers played 14 games in 1947, with outcomes: 8 wins, 4 losses, and 2 ties. Their final recorded season record is 8 - 4 - 2. Therefore, they lost 4 games, not 2.

Evidence with executed SQL (and returned results):

1) Total number of games played
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;
- Result: total_games = 14

2) Number of losses
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS loss_count FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE TRIM(UPPER(result)) = 'L';
- Result: loss_count = 4

3) Counts of wins, losses, and ties
- SQL:
SELECT TRIM(UPPER(result)) AS result_normalized, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season GROUP BY TRIM(UPPER(result)) ORDER BY result_normalized;
- Results:
  - result_normalized = L, cnt = 4
  - result_normalized = T, cnt = 2
  - result_normalized = W, cnt = 8

4) Final season record shown in the table
- SQL:
SELECT record FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY week DESC LIMIT 1;
- Result: record = '8 - 4 - 2'

Conclusion: The data shows 4 losses in 14 games (record 8-4-2). The claim that they lost 2 out of 14 games is not supported.

Assumptions made:
- "49ers" refers to the San Francisco 49ers team in the 1947 season.
- The season outcomes are taken from the table t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season, which lists each game’s result and the cumulative record.
