Objective
- Verify whether the competition for the match “he” won on June 2, 2007 was a Friendly.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5), schema: public
- Relevant table: branimir_suba_i (columns: date, venue, score, result, competition)

Evidence gathered (executed SQL)
1) Identify the row on June 2, 2007 and view key fields
- SQL: SELECT date, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE date ILIKE '%2007%';
- Returned row matching the target date:
  - date: "june 2 , 2007"
  - result: "lost"
  - competition: "uefa euro 2008 qualifying"

2) Retrieve the full row for June 2, 2007
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE date ILIKE '%june 2%' AND date ILIKE '%2007%';
- Result (all columns):
  - date: "june 2 , 2007"
  - venue: "baku , azerbaijan"
  - score: "1 - 3"
  - result: "lost"
  - competition: "uefa euro 2008 qualifying"

Findings
- The match on June 2, 2007 was not a win; the recorded result is "lost".
- The competition is listed as "uefa euro 2008 qualifying", not a Friendly.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the competition that he win on June 2, 2007 [was] friendly” is contradicted by the data. The match was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying fixture and was lost, not won, and therefore was not a Friendly.

Assumptions
- “He” refers to the subject represented by the table branimir_suba_i.
- The date field is stored as text; a case-insensitive substring search was used to locate the June 2, 2007 entry.
