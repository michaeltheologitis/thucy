Summary conclusion:
- Tokyo, Japan was indeed the location of Katsuya Inoue’s bout against Hikaru Sato, but that fight ended in Round 1 (3:53), not “after round 2.” Therefore, the claim as stated is not accurate regarding the round.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact database), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.katsuya_inoue with columns (res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location).

Schema evidence:
- Table: public.katsuya_inoue(res text, record text, opponent text, method text, event text, round bigint, time text, location text)

Evidence query 1 — Find the fight vs Hikaru Sato:
SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time, location
FROM public.katsuya_inoue
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Hikaru%';

Result:
- res: win
- opponent: hikaru sato
- method: tko (punches)
- event: pancrase - brave 6
- round: 1
- time: 3:53
- location: tokyo , japan

Evidence query 2 — Check for any other opponents containing “sato” and their rounds/locations (to ensure no other Hikaru Sato entries or a fight that ended after round 2 against him):
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent ILIKE '%sato%';

Result:
- count = 4

SQL (details):
SELECT opponent, round, location FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent ILIKE '%sato%' ORDER BY round NULLS LAST;

Results:
- hikaru sato — round 1 — tokyo , japan
- satoru kitaoka — round 3 — tokyo , japan
- satoru kitaoka — round 3 — tokyo , japan
- satoru kitaoka — round 3 — chiba , japan

Interpretation:
- The only bout against Hikaru Sato ended in Round 1 and took place in Tokyo, Japan. Matches that ended after Round 2 (Round 3) involve Satoru Kitaoka, not Hikaru Sato.

Answer:
- Location: Tokyo, Japan — True for the Hikaru Sato bout.
- “End after round 2” — False for the Hikaru Sato bout (it ended in Round 1).

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Katsuya Inoue fight record represented by the public.katsuya_inoue table and specifically to the bout against Hikaru Sato within this dataset.
