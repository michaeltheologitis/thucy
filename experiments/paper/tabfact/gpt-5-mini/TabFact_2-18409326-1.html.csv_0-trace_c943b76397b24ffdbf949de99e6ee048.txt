Claim to verify: "chsu - fm , own by bell media , have a frequency of 00 99.9 fm"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL instance (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner).

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Broad table inspection to see available stations in Kelowna
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna LIMIT 200;
Key returned rows (columns: frequency | call sign | branding | format | owner):
- Row 6: 00 99.9 fm | chsu - fm | 99.9 sun fm | contemporary hits radio | bell media

2) Targeted lookup for the specific call sign
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, format, owner
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
WHERE lower("call sign") = lower('chsu - fm');
Result (one row):
- call sign: chsu - fm
- frequency: 00 99.9 fm
- branding: 99.9 sun fm
- format: contemporary hits radio
- owner: bell media

Conclusion:
- The database row for call sign "chsu - fm" lists owner as "bell media" and frequency as "00 99.9 fm". This matches the claim exactly.

Verdict reasoning:
- Both the ownership (Bell Media) and the frequency value as formatted in the dataset ("00 99.9 fm") are directly supported by the queried data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the entry for CHSU-FM in Kelowna captured in the public.media_in_kelowna table.
- The formatting of the frequency field (including the leading "00 ") is taken as-is from the dataset and interpreted literally for verification purposes.
