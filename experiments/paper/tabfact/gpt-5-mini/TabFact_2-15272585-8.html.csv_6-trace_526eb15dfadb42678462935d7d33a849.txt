Summary conclusion
The claim that “Galina Voskoboeva plays 20% of her games on clay and 1% on hard” is not supported by the available data. In the accessible dataset of her matches, clay accounts for 40% of matches, while hard surfaces account for either 20% (strictly “hard”) or 60% (combining “hard” and “hard (i)”/indoor hard). Both figures contradict the stated 20% clay and 1% hard.

What data source was checked
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.galina_voskoboeva (columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score)

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Counting total matches
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
Result:
- total_matches = 5

2) Distribution by raw surface values
SQL:
SELECT COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(surface), ''), '(blank)') AS surface,
       COUNT(*) AS match_count,
       ROUND(100.0*COUNT(*)/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.galina_voskoboeva), 2) AS percent_of_total
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(surface), ''), '(blank)')
ORDER BY match_count DESC;
Results (surface, match_count, percent_of_total):
- hard (i): 2 matches, 40.00%
- clay: 2 matches, 40.00%
- hard: 1 match, 20.00%
Interpretation:
- Clay = 40% (not 20%)
- Hard (strictly the value “hard”) = 20% (not 1%)

3) Distribution by normalized surface (mapping “hard (i)” to “hard”)
SQL:
WITH t AS (
  SELECT *, CASE
      WHEN surface IS NULL OR trim(surface) = '' THEN '(blank)'
      ELSE lower(trim(surface))
    END AS surf_trim
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
), normalized AS (
  SELECT CASE
      WHEN surf_trim = 'hard (i)' THEN 'hard'
      WHEN surf_trim = 'hard' THEN 'hard'
      WHEN surf_trim = 'clay' THEN 'clay'
      ELSE surf_trim
    END AS surface_normalized
  FROM t
), totals AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*)::integer AS total_matches FROM normalized
)
SELECT
  surface_normalized,
  COUNT(*) AS match_count,
  ROUND( (COUNT(*)::numeric / (SELECT total_matches FROM totals)) * 100.0, 2) AS percent_of_total
FROM normalized
GROUP BY surface_normalized
ORDER BY match_count DESC, surface_normalized;
Results (surface_normalized, match_count, percent_of_total):
- hard: 3 matches, 60.00%
- clay: 2 matches, 40.00%
Interpretation:
- When counting indoor hard (“hard (i)”) as hard, hard surfaces represent 60% of matches—not 1%.

Assessment vs. the claim
- Claimed clay share: 20%
  Evidence: 40% (contradicted)
- Claimed hard share: 1%
  Evidence: 20% if using only the raw “hard” label; 60% if combining “hard” and “hard (i)” (both contradict 1%).

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate given the data in the public.galina_voskoboeva table.

Assumptions
- “Game” refers to matches; each row in public.galina_voskoboeva represents one match.
- Surfaces are taken from the surface column as labeled; “hard (i)” is treated as indoor hard and a subtype of hard in the normalization step.
- The analysis is limited to the accessible dataset, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
