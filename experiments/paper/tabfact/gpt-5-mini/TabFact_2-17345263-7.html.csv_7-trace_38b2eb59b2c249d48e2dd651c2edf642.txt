Claim to verify: “34028 be the total attendance on September 11.”

Data sources explored
- Verified available database: TabFact (schema: public). Contains table public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 with columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text).

What the data shows
- There are no games in this dataset with a date matching “September 11” (including common textual/numeric variants). Therefore, the total attendance on September 11 in this dataset is 0.
- The dataset does include “september 12” with attendance 34028 (opponent: chattanooga). This likely explains the 34028 figure, but it is for September 12, not September 11.

Executed SQL queries and returned results (evidence)
1) Check for exact textual match "September 11"
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS matching_rows
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ILIKE '%September 11%';
Result:
matching_rows = 0

2) Sum attendance for exact textual match "September 11"
SQL:
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(NULLIF(regexp_replace(attendance, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::bigint), 0) AS total_attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ILIKE '%September 11%';
Result:
total_attendance = 0

3) Show dataset size (context)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99;
Result:
count = 12

4) Check common September 11 textual patterns
SQL:
SELECT count(*)
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ILIKE '%September 11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%Sept 11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%Sept. 11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%Sep 11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%Sep. 11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%9/11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%09/11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%9-11%'
   OR date ILIKE '%09-11%';
Result:
count = 0

5) List September entries for context (to show nearby dates)
SQL:
SELECT date, attendance, opponent
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ILIKE '%september%';
Results:
- date = "september 5", attendance = "48134", opponent = "virginia tech"
- date = "september 12", attendance = "34028", opponent = "chattanooga"
- date = "september 19", attendance = "19186", opponent = "ohio"

6) Regex-based comprehensive match and sum for “September 11” variants
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ~* '(^|\s)(September|Sept\.?|Sep\.?)\s+11(\b|$)'
   OR date ~* '(^|\s)0?9[/-]11(\b|$)';
Result:
match_count = 0

SQL (sum):
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(COALESCE(NULLIF(regexp_replace(attendance, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::integer, 0)), 0) AS total_attendance_int
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE date ~* '(^|\s)(September|Sept\.?|Sep\.?)\s+11(\b|$)'
   OR date ~* '(^|\s)0?9[/-]11(\b|$)';
Result:
total_attendance_int = 0

Conclusion
- The claim that the total attendance on September 11 is 34028 is not supported by the available data; the dataset contains no events on September 11, so the total is 0. A nearby date, September 12, has attendance 34028.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the authoritative data source discovered (TabFact public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99, seasons 1990–1999).
- Date matching was performed case-insensitively and included common textual/numeric variants for “September 11.”
- Attendance values are stored as text and were converted to integers by stripping non-digit characters before summation.
