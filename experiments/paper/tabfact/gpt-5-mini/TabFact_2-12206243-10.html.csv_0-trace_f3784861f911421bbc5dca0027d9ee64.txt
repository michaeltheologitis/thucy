Summary of claim: The user asserts that on September 1, in a game against the Mets, the result was a 3–0 win, with a crowd attendance of 19,196.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date [text], opponent [text], score [text], loss [text], attendance [bigint], record [text])

Step 1: Identify date formatting and September entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY date;
- Result showed dates stored as lowercase strings like 'september <day>'.

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'september %' ORDER BY (split_part(date,' ',2))::int;
- Returned (excerpt relevant to Mets):
  september 1 — mets — 3 - 0 — 19196
  september 2 — mets — 8 - 5 — 17635
  september 3 — mets — 4 - 2 — 14513

Step 2: Retrieve full row for September 1 to determine outcome context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date = 'september 1';
- Result:
  date: september 1
  opponent: mets
  score: 3 - 0
  loss: hentgen (14 - 9)
  attendance: 19196
  record: 65 - 71

Step 3: Check surrounding days for consistency on win/loss tracking
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date IN ('september 1','september 2','september 3');
- Results:
  september 1 | mets | 3 - 0 | loss: hentgen (14 - 9) | record: 65 - 71
  september 2 | mets | 8 - 5 | loss: clemens (20 - 5) | record: 65 - 72
  september 3 | mets | 4 - 2 | loss: quantrill (6 - 6) | record: 65 - 73

Interpretation and verification:
- Opponent and score: The September 1 opponent was indeed the Mets, and the recorded score is 3–0. This matches the claim’s opponent and score.
- Attendance: The attendance is recorded as 19,196, matching the claim exactly.
- Outcome (win vs loss): The “loss” column lists the losing pitcher for the game. On September 1, the losing pitcher is listed as Hentgen (a Blue Jays pitcher), and the team record after the game is 65–71. This indicates the Blue Jays lost that game. Therefore, while the score was 3–0, it was a 3–0 loss for the Blue Jays (i.e., Mets 3, Blue Jays 0), not a win.

Conclusion: The date, opponent, scoreline, and attendance are correct; however, the outcome was a loss, not a win.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Toronto Blue Jays’ September 1 game (the only available authoritative dataset is the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season table).
- The “loss” column denotes the losing pitcher of the game; when it is a Blue Jays pitcher, the Blue Jays lost; when it is an opponent’s pitcher, the Blue Jays won.
