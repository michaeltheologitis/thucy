Claim to verify: "when the opponent be pride, it be an away game at villanova stadium"

Step 1 — Data source discovery
- Available source: postgres_tabfact34 (TabFact) — public schema

Step 2 — Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
  - Columns (TEXT): date, opponent, "home / away", field, result

Step 3 — Evidence query
- Purpose: Find all games where opponent mentions "Pride" and inspect home/away and field.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "home / away", field, result
FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%pride%';

- Results (2 rows):
  1) date: june 18 | opponent: pride | home / away: away | field: alumni stadium (kean university) | result: w 11 - 10
  2) date: august 11 | opponent: pride | home / away: home | field: villanova stadium | result: l 12 - 16

Assessment against the claim
- The game at Villanova Stadium (august 11) is marked as HOME, not AWAY.
- The AWAY game vs Pride (june 18) was at Alumni Stadium (Kean University), not Villanova Stadium.
- Therefore, the statement that when the opponent is Pride it is an away game at Villanova Stadium is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate based on the 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season table.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the context of the available table (t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season) and read "opponent be pride" as rows where opponent equals/mentions "Pride"; "away game at Villanova Stadium" as rows with "home / away" = 'away' and field = 'villanova stadium'.
