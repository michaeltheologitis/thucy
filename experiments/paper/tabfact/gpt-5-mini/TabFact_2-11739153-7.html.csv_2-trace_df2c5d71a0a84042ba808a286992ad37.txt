Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the matches on February 12 and February 20 both have the same decision.

Data source discovery and schema understanding:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence queries and results:
1) Retrieve both games (exact executed SQL):
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'February 12%' OR date ILIKE 'February 20%'
ORDER BY date;
Results:
- date: february 12 | visitor: minnesota | score: 2 - 4 | home: edmonton | decision: harding
- date: february 20 | visitor: minnesota | score: 0 - 3 | home: chicago  | decision: harding

2) Confirm uniqueness of those dates (exact executed SQL):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_feb_12_ilike FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE date ILIKE '%february 12%';
Result: 1
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_feb_20_ilike FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE date ILIKE '%february 20%';
Result: 1

Analysis:
- Both queried rows show the same value in the decision column: harding.
- Counts confirm there is exactly one game on each of those dates in the table, avoiding ambiguity.

Conclusion:
- The data shows that the February 12 and February 20 games both have the same decision (harding).

Assumptions:
- The claim’s “match on February 12 and February 20” refers to the dates stored in the season table for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild, where date values are lowercase strings (e.g., “february 12”).
- “Decision” corresponds to the decision field in the table (which, per values observed, denotes the goaltender credited with the decision).
