Claim interpreted: “All of the constituencies have SNP’s place as 3rd in 2003.”

What I checked
- The available authoritative dataset is a single table: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007. Within it, there is a text column named “snp 's place 2003” that explicitly records the SNP’s placement in 2003 for each listed constituency. I verified the distribution of this column across all rows.

Evidence
1) Total number of constituencies (rows) in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_constituencies FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
Result:
- total_constituencies: 11

2) Distribution of values in column “snp 's place 2003”
SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN "snp 's place 2003" IS NULL THEN 'NULL' ELSE "snp 's place 2003" END AS snp_place_2003, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
GROUP BY CASE WHEN "snp 's place 2003" IS NULL THEN 'NULL' ELSE "snp 's place 2003" END
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- '2nd': 11
- No other values and no NULLs

3) Constituencies where “snp 's place 2003” is not equal to '3rd' (including NULLs)
SQL:
SELECT constituency, "snp 's place 2003"
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE "snp 's place 2003" IS DISTINCT FROM '3rd'
ORDER BY constituency;
Result (constituency — snp 's place 2003'):
- aberdeen central — 2nd
- cumbernauld & kilsyth — 2nd
- dundee west — 2nd
- galloway & upper nithsdale — 2nd
- glasgow govan — 2nd
- kilmarnock & loudoun — 2nd
- linlithgow — 2nd
- paisley south — 2nd
- tweeddale , ettrick & lauderdale — 2nd
- west renfrewshire — 2nd
- western isles — 2nd

Finding
- In this dataset, every constituency listed has “snp 's place 2003” = '2nd'. None have '3rd'.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Within the available authoritative dataset, SNP’s place in 2003 is consistently 2nd, not 3rd, for all 11 constituencies present.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim to mean: for all constituencies recorded in the data, the SNP finished 3rd in 2003. I verified this against the column “snp 's place 2003”.
- The scope of verification is limited to the available dataset (public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007), which contains 11 constituencies. Within its scope, the evidence is definitive.
