Claim assessed: "there be 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin and chris topping"

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
- Relevant columns: name (text), position (text), "total goals" (bigint), plus league/cup goal breakdowns

What the data shows
1) Determine the maximum total goals and who has it
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX("total goals") AS max_total_goals FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;
- Result:
  max_total_goals = 27

- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "total goals" = 27;
- Result:
  name = ian robins, total goals = 27

- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_players_with_max FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "total goals" = 27;
- Result:
  num_players_with_max = 1

Conclusion from (1): Only one player has the maximum total goals, and that player is "ian robins" with 27.

2) Check the named players in the claim
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE 'chris topping' OR name ILIKE 'ian robin%' ORDER BY name;
- Results:
  - chris topping — total goals: 0
  - ian robins — total goals: 27

Conclusion from (2): "chris topping" has 0 total goals, and the top scorer is "ian robins" (note: not "ian robin").

3) Context: top goal scorers list
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, position, "total goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY "total goals" DESC, name ASC LIMIT 10;
- Results (top):
  1. ian robins — fw — 27
  2. peter fletcher — fw — 18
  3. steve kindon — fw — 14
  4. david cowling — mf — 10
  5. brian stanton — mf — 9
  ...

Final assessment
- The data shows a single top scorer (ian robins) with 27 total goals. There are not two players tied for the highest total goals, and chris topping has 0 total goals. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- "total goal" was interpreted as the "total goals" column in the public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season table.
- The name "ian robin" in the claim was treated as a likely reference to "ian robins" (as recorded in the data).
