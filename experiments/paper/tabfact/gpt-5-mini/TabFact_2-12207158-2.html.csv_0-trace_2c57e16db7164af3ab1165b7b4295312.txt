Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact29 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season(date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Inspect record formatting to match exactly how “4 - 5” appears in the data
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT record FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY record;
Result (excerpt): {"record":"1 - 0"}, …, {"record":"4 - 4"}, {"record":"4 - 5"}, {"record":"5 - 5"}, …

2) Retrieve the game(s) where the record is 4 - 5
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE record = '4 - 5';
Result:
{"date":"april 12","opponent":"yankees","record":"4 - 5","score":"5 - 3"}

Interpretation
- The table shows exactly one instance where the team’s record is 4 - 5, and in that instance the opponent is “yankees,” which matches the claim that the opponent was the Yankee(s) when the record was 4 - 5.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the opponent be the yankee” as referring to the MLB team “New York Yankees,” matching the table’s “yankees.”
- Interpreted the claim within the context of the available dataset (1989 Toronto Blue Jays season) and matched the record format exactly as stored ("4 - 5" with spaces).
