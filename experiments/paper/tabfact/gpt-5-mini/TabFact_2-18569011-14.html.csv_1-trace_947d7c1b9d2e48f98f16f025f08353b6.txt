Claim interpreted: “The time for Wallace Spearmon (United States) is more than the time for Rondell Sorillo (Trinidad and Tobago).” In sprint events, a higher time means a slower performance.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres (columns: lane, athlete, nationality, time, react)

Evidence retrieved
1) Result for Wallace Spearmon
- Returned row: wallace spearmon — united states — 20.39 — 0.202
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, nationality, time, react
  FROM public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
  WHERE athlete ILIKE '%spearmon%' OR athlete ILIKE '%sorrill%';

2) Result for Rondell Sorillo
- Returned row: rondell sorillo — trinidad and tobago — 20.63 — 0.164
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, nationality, time, react
  FROM public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
  WHERE athlete ILIKE '%sorr%' OR athlete ILIKE '%rond%';

Analysis
- Wallace Spearmon time: 20.39 seconds
- Rondell Sorillo time: 20.63 seconds
- Comparison: 20.39 < 20.63, so Spearmon's time is not more than Sorillo’s; Spearmon was faster (lower time).

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the 2008 Olympic men’s 200m table.

Assumptions
- “Time” refers to finishing time in the table public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres.
- The claim is evaluated within this dataset (one row per athlete in the given table). The name “Rondell Sorillo” matches the table entry spelling.
