Claim to verify: “stuart potts wasn't the man of the match in the league / cup.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact24 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  - Columns: date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, man of the match

Schema notes
- No separate players or awards tables; “man of the match” is a free-text column in this table.
- Competition values observed include: “league” and “league / cup”.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Exact-case check for “Stuart Potts” anywhere
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE "man of the match" = 'Stuart Potts';
Result:
cnt = 0

2) Case-insensitive, flexible check for “stuart potts” (to account for casing/spacing)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_matches
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE TRIM("man of the match") ILIKE '%stuart%potts%';
Result:
- total_matches: 1

Breakdown by competition
SQL:
SELECT competition, count(*) AS matches
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE TRIM("man of the match") ILIKE '%stuart%potts%'
GROUP BY competition
ORDER BY matches DESC;
Result:
- competition: league / cup, matches: 1

List matching row(s)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, "man of the match"
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE TRIM("man of the match") ILIKE '%stuart%potts%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: 22nd, opponent: wightlink raiders, venue: away, result: lost 5 - 4, attendance: 509, competition: league / cup, man of the match: stuart potts

3) Cross-check: list all “league / cup” matches and their man of the match values
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, competition, "man of the match" FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE competition = 'league / cup' ORDER BY date;
Result (excerpt):
- 15th — sheffield scimitars — man of the match: rick plant
- 16th — milton keynes lightning — man of the match: david savage
- 19th — romford raiders — man of the match: alex mettam
- 1st — slough jets — man of the match: lukas smital
- 22nd — wightlink raiders — man of the match: stuart potts
- 30th — bracknell bees — man of the match: joe watkins
- 8th — swindon wildcats — man of the match: lukas smital
- 9th — swindon wildcats — man of the match: neil liddiard

4) Optional check: Was he man of the match in “league” (not “league / cup”)?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE lower(competition) = 'league'
  AND lower("man of the match") = 'stuart potts';
Result:
- match_count = 0

Conclusion
- The dataset shows at least one “league / cup” match where the man of the match is “stuart potts” (22nd vs Wightlink Raiders). Therefore, the claim that “stuart potts wasn't the man of the match in the league / cup” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The verification context is the available dataset: Guildford Flames 2008–09 season table (public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season).
- “league / cup” refers to the competition value exactly as recorded in the dataset.
- Name matching used a case-insensitive search to account for casing differences (e.g., “stuart potts” vs “Stuart Potts”).
