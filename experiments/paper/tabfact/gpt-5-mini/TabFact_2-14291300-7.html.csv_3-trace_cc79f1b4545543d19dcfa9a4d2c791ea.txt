Claim interpreted: “The Chicago Black Hawks are the only opponent with 63 points.” I interpret “opponent” as the opponent field and “points” as the points column in the available dataset.

Data source discovery:
- Connected database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table (columns: game, march, opponent, score, record, points)

Evidence 1: List all rows where points = 63
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, march, opponent, score, record, points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE points = 63;
Result:
- game: 68, march: 13, opponent: toronto maple leafs, score: 3 - 2, record: 25 - 30 - 13, points: 63

Evidence 2: Count distinct opponents with points = 63
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS distinct_opponents FROM public.my_info_table WHERE points = 63;
Result:
- distinct_opponents: 1

Evidence 3: Check for any Chicago Black Hawks entries and their points
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, points, game, march, score, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE opponent ILIKE '%chicago black hawk%' OR opponent ILIKE '%chicago blackhawks%';
Result:
- opponent: chicago black hawks, points: 67, game: 74, march: 27, score: 1 - 3, record: 26 - 33 - 15

Executed SQL (broader Chicago check):
SELECT opponent, points, game, march, score, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE opponent ILIKE '%chicago%';
Result:
- opponent: chicago black hawks, points: 67, game: 74, march: 27, score: 1 - 3, record: 26 - 33 - 15

Assessment:
- There is exactly one opponent with 63 points in the dataset, but it is “toronto maple leafs,” not “chicago black hawks.”
- The Chicago Black Hawks appear once with 67 points, not 63.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “chicago black hawk” refers to the team recorded as “chicago black hawks.”
- “opponent” and “points” refer to the opponent and points columns in public.my_info_table.
- Verification is limited to the accessible TabFact (postgres_tabfact19) dataset.
