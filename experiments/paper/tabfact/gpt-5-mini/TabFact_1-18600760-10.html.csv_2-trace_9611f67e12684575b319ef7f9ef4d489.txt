Claim assessed: "grand fork county have 36.199 square mile of land."

What I checked
- I searched the available dataset (list_of_townships_in_north_dakota) for entries related to Grand Forks and aggregated land area for that county value from the township-level records.

Evidence from data and executed SQL
1) Identify county value(s) containing "Grand Forks"
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county ILIKE '%Grand Forks%';
Result:
- grand forks

2) Aggregate land area for county = 'grand forks' (sum of township land areas in the dataset)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_townships, SUM("land ( sqmi )") AS total_land_sqmi
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE LOWER(county) = 'grand forks';
Result:
- num_townships = 1
- total_land_sqmi = 36.199

3) List the township(s) contributing to that sum for transparency
SQL:
SELECT township, "land ( sqmi )" AS land_sqmi
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE LOWER(county) = 'grand forks';
Result:
- township: johnstown, land_sqmi: 36.199

4) Confirm no other similarly named county values are present
SQL:
SELECT county, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE county ILIKE '%grand%'
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY cnt DESC, county;
Result:
- grand forks — 1 row

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset and aggregating the land area of townships recorded under county = 'grand forks', the total comes to 36.199 square miles. However, this figure is entirely driven by a single township record (Johnstown) present for that county in this dataset. Therefore, while the number 36.199 square miles matches the sum of recorded township land area for 'grand forks' in this data, it should not be interpreted as a comprehensive county-wide land area total unless the dataset is known to be complete for that county.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "grand fork county" as the county value 'grand forks' in the dataset.
- Approximated county land area by summing the "land ( sqmi )" values of townships listed for that county in the dataset. The dataset scope is township-level; it does not provide an explicit county-level total.
