Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table (from schema exploration): public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football with columns: position, team, points, played, against, difference.

Verification
1) Count of teams by goal difference sign
- Executed SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(REPLACE(difference,' ','') AS integer) > 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS positive_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(REPLACE(difference,' ','') AS integer) < 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS negative_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(REPLACE(difference,' ','') AS integer) = 0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS zero_count
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football;
- Result:
  - positive_count: 4
  - negative_count: 4
  - zero_count: 1

2) Team-by-team goal differences (evidence listing)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT team, CAST(REPLACE(difference,' ','') AS integer) AS goal_difference
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
ORDER BY goal_difference DESC;
- Result (team — goal_difference):
  - fluminense — 10
  - flamengo — 8
  - corinthians — 4
  - palestra itália — 3
  - botafogo — 0
  - vasco da gama — -2
  - portuguesa — -10
  - américa — -10
  - são paulo — -13

3) Raw stored strings for “difference” (to justify cleaning step)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT team, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY difference DESC;
- Result (team — raw difference):
  - flamengo — "8"
  - corinthians — "4"
  - palestra itália — "3"
  - fluminense — "10"
  - botafogo — "0"
  - vasco da gama — "- 2"
  - são paulo — "- 13"
  - américa — "- 10"
  - portuguesa — "- 10"

Conclusion
- The data show 4 teams with a negative goal difference and 4 teams with a positive goal difference (with 1 team at zero). This directly supports the claim that 4 teams have a minus goal difference while only 4 have scored more than they conceded.

Assumptions
- “difference” is interpreted as goal difference (goals scored minus goals against).
- Negative values stored with an embedded space (e.g., "- 2") were normalized by removing spaces before numeric casting to ensure accurate counting.
