Claim to verify: “vodafone have 8704 subscriber (thousands) in 2006 with a 38 growth percentage.”

Step 1 — Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database TabFact, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa with columns: provider (text), country (text), subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint), subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint), growth % (double precision).

Step 2 — Evidence from the data
1) Locate Vodafone entry and read 2006 subscribers and growth %
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %" 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE provider ILIKE '%Vodafone%';
Result:
- provider: vodafone; country: egypt; subscribers (2006) (thousands): 8704; growth %: 42

2) Cross-check the growth % by computing it from 2005 and 2006 subscriber counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" AS subs2005, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" AS subs2006, "growth %" AS growth_pct, CASE WHEN "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" = 0 THEN NULL ELSE ROUND((("subscribers (2006) (thousands)" - "subscribers (2005) (thousands)")::numeric / "subscribers (2005) (thousands)") * 100, 6) END AS computed_growth_pct FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE '%vodafone%';
Result:
- provider: vodafone; subs2005: 6125 (thousands); subs2006: 8704 (thousands); growth % (stored): 42; computed_growth_pct: 42.106122

Executed SQL (difference between computed and stored growth):
SELECT provider, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" AS subs2005, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" AS subs2006, "growth %" AS growth_pct, ROUND(((("subscribers (2006) (thousands)" - "subscribers (2005) (thousands)")::numeric / "subscribers (2005) (thousands)") * 100) - "growth %"::numeric, 6) AS difference_pct FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE '%vodafone%';
Result:
- provider: vodafone; subs2005: 6125; subs2006: 8704; growth % (stored): 42; difference_pct: 0.106122

Step 3 — Assessment of the claim
- “8704 subscriber (thousands) in 2006”: Supported. The dataset records 8704 (thousands) for Vodafone (Egypt) in 2006.
- “with a 38 growth percentage”: Not supported. The dataset records 42% growth (computed 42.106%), not 38%.

Conclusion: The claim correctly states the 2006 subscriber count but incorrectly states the growth percentage.

Assumptions made
- “vodafone” refers to the Vodafone entry present in the mobile_telephony_in_africa table (which corresponds to Egypt). The claim did not specify country, and only one Vodafone row exists in this dataset.
- Growth % is interpreted as the YoY change from 2005 to 2006; the table stores it as an integer, and the computed precise value (~42.106%) aligns with the stored 42% by rounding.
