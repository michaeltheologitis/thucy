Data discovery:

- Relevant table: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season

Schema check (summary):
- Columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)
- Date is stored as text in the format "month day" (no year)

Evidence collection:
1) Understand date formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 20;
Result (sample): may 21; may 22; june 25; may 20; june 24

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE date ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{1,2}$') AS match_simple_format FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season;
Result: total = 5; match_simple_format = 5

2) Count games on May 20
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_on_may_20
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%May 20%';
Result: games_on_may_20 = 1

3) Retrieve details for May 20
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", attendance, location
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%May 20%';

- date: "may 20"
- winning team: "texas"
- score: "7 - 3"
- winning pitcher: "kenny rogers"
- losing pitcher: "brandon backe"
