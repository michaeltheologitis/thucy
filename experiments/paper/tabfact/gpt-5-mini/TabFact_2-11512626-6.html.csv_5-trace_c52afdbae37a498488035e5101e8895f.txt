Claim to verify: "in a game on august 30, mogler (1 - 10) won while in a game against oquist"

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible relational database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record). This appears to be a game log for the 1997 Colorado Rockies.

Evidence gathered (with executed SQL)
1) Locate the August 30 game
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Aug%' AND date ILIKE '%30%';
Result (one row):
{ "date": "august 30", "opponent": "athletics", "score": "4 - 3", "loss": "mohler (1 - 10)", "attendance": 48308, "record": "67 - 70" }
Interpretation: On August 30 vs. Athletics, the table records the losing pitcher as "mohler (1 - 10)".

2) Check any mention of "Oquist"
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Oquist%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Oquist%' OR score ILIKE '%Oquist%' OR loss ILIKE '%Oquist%' OR record ILIKE '%Oquist%';
Result (one row):
{ "date": "august 31", "opponent": "athletics", "score": "10 - 4", "loss": "oquist (2 - 5)", "record": "68 - 70" }
Interpretation: "Oquist" appears on August 31 (not August 30) and is recorded as the losing pitcher with record 2-5.

3) Confirm all mentions of "Mohler"
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%Mohler%'
   OR opponent ILIKE '%Mohler%'
   OR score ILIKE '%Mohler%'
   OR loss ILIKE '%Mohler%'
   OR record ILIKE '%Mohler%';
Result:
- date: august 30; opponent: athletics; score: 4 - 3; loss: mohler (1 - 10); record: 67 - 70
Interpretation: The only "Mohler" mention is on August 30, and he is listed under the "loss" field.

4) Check for the exact spelling "Mogler"
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Mogler%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Mogler%' OR score ILIKE '%Mogler%' OR loss ILIKE '%Mogler%' OR CAST(attendance AS text) ILIKE '%Mogler%' OR record ILIKE '%Mogler%';
Result: match_count = 0
Interpretation: There is no "Mogler" in the table; this likely refers to "Mohler".

Assessment against the claim
- The August 30 entry shows "loss: mohler (1 - 10)", indicating Mohler was the losing pitcher, not the winner. This directly contradicts the claim that he "won" that game.
- "Oquist" does not appear in the August 30 entry; he appears on August 31 as the losing pitcher. Therefore, the clause "in a game against oquist" does not align with the August 30 game.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim. On August 30, Mohler (spelled "mohler" in the data) is listed as the losing pitcher, and Oquist is associated with the next day’s game, not the August 30 game.

Assumptions made
- "mogler" in the claim refers to "mohler" as recorded in the data.
- "won" means recorded as the game’s winning pitcher; the table’s "loss" field denotes the losing pitcher.
- The table is a reliable record of the 1997 Colorado Rockies’ game log, with opponent and pitcher details as shown.
