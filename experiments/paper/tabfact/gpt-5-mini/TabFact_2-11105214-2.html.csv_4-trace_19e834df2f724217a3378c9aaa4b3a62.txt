Claim assessed: “0.17 be the lowest swing to gain point in the Scottish Parliament election, 2007.”

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
- Relevant columns: constituency, "swing to gain", "winning party 2003", result, "snp 's place 2003"

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify the minimum “swing to gain” value in the dataset.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("swing to gain") AS min_swing FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
- Result:
  [{"min_swing": 0.17}]

2) Retrieve the constituency(ies) with that minimum value and context.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT constituency, "swing to gain", result, "winning party 2003" 
  FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 
  WHERE "swing to gain" = 0.17;
- Result:
  [{"constituency": "galloway & upper nithsdale", "swing to gain": 0.17, "result": "con hold", "winning party 2003": "conservative"}]

Findings:
- The minimum “swing to gain” recorded in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election dataset is 0.17.
- This value appears for the constituency “Galloway & Upper Nithsdale,” where the result is noted as “con hold.”

Conclusion: The data supports the claim that 0.17 was the lowest swing-to-gain figure in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election dataset examined.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “lowest swing to gain point” as the minimum value in the “swing to gain” column (measured in percentage points) for the 2007 Scottish Parliament election results present in the referenced table.
