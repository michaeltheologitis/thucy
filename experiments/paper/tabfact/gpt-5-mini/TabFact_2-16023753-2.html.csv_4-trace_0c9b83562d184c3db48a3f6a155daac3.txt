Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Find the minimum attendance recorded in the table
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result:
{"min_attendance": 32343}

2) Retrieve the game(s) with that minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season WHERE attendance = 32343 ORDER BY week;
Result row(s):
{"week": 8, "date": "october 23 , 1983", "opponent": "baltimore colts", "result": "w 21 - 7", "attendance": 32343}

Assessment
- The lowest attendance value present in the available game dataset is 32343. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the lowest attendance figure for a game” as referring to the games represented in the available table (1983 Miami Dolphins season), since this is the only accessible dataset with an attendance field.
