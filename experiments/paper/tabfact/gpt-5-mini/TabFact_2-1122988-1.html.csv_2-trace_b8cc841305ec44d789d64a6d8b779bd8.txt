Claim to verify: "the most lap when the grid be 5 be 34.0"

Interpretation: The maximum number of laps completed by the driver who started from grid position 5 in the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix is 34.0 laps.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix (columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid)

Evidence from data:
1) List entries with grid = 5
Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired", grid
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
WHERE grid = 5;
Result:
- driver: michele alboreto; constructor: ferrari; laps: 43; time / retired: engine; grid: 5

2) Compute the maximum laps among entries with grid = 5
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
WHERE grid = 5;
Result:
- max_laps: 43

Conclusion: The maximum laps for the driver starting from grid position 5 is 43, not 34.0. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "most lap" was interpreted as the maximum value of the laps column.
- The claim pertains to the available dataset (1987 Hungarian Grand Prix only).
