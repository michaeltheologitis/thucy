Claim to verify (interpreted): Yugoslavia’s national team scored 7 and conceded 3 in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers.

Conclusion: The dataset shows three matches labeled “1982 wcq” with an aggregate score of 7 scored and 3 conceded. The totals match the claim, though they were achieved across 3 matches (not 2). 

Evidence from the database
1) Identify how World Cup qualifiers are labeled
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "type of game" FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results ORDER BY "type of game";
- Result:
  - 1982 wcq
  - balkan cup
  - friendly

2) List all 1982 World Cup qualifier matches for Yugoslavia
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq'
  ORDER BY to_date(initcap(date), 'Month DD');
- Result (chronological):
  - september 10 — luxembourg — opponent: luxembourg — results: 5:0
  - september 27 — ljubljana — opponent: denmark — results: 2:1
  - november 15 — torino , italy — opponent: italy — results: 0:2

3) Compute totals (goals for/against) in 1982 WCQ
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches,
         SUM((split_part(results, ':', 1))::int) AS goals_for,
         SUM((split_part(results, ':', 2))::int) AS goals_against
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq';
- Result:
  - matches: 3
  - goals_for: 7
  - goals_against: 3

Assessment
- Supported: The aggregate goals (7 scored, 3 conceded) in the 1982 World Cup qualifiers match the claim.
- Note: These totals come from 3 qualifiers, not 2. If the mention of “2” in the claim was intended to refer to the number of matches, it is inconsistent with the data here.

Assumptions
- I interpret “2 1982 world cup qualify” as referring to the 1982 World Cup qualifying campaign, with “2” being a typographical artifact rather than the number of matches. If “2” was meant to indicate two matches, that is contradicted by the data, which shows three matches.
