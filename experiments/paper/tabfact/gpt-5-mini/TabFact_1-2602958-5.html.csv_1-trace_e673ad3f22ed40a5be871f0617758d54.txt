Evidence from executed SQL
1) Count of episodes in 2003 directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE director ILIKE '%sherman%'
  AND director ILIKE '%palladino%'
  AND "original air date" ILIKE '%2003%';
Result:
count = 1

2) List those 2003 episodes (title and original air date)

Conclusion
- The database shows exactly 1 Gilmore Girls episode in 2003 directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino ("Ballrooms and Biscotti" on September 23, 2003). The claim that she directed 4 episodes in 2003 is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available dataset (Gilmore Girls episodes only).
- Accounted for variations in name formatting by matching director ILIKE '%sherman%' AND ILIKE '%palladino%'.
- Year filtering used a text match on "original air date" containing '2003' due to the column being stored as text.
