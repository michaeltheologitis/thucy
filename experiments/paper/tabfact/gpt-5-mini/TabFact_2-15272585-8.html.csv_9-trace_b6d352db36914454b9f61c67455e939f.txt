Claim to verify: "on average, Galina Voskoboeva lose with only 4 point against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa."

Summary conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available data. In the dataset, Galina Voskoboeva has only wins against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa and zero losses, so no losing average (by any margin) exists for these opponents.

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema
- Relevant table: public.galina_voskoboeva with columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all matches against opponents containing "Kravets" or "Canepa"
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, outcome, score, date, tournament, surface
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Kravets%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Canepa%';

Results:
- date: 29 june 2003 | opponent: oleksandra kravets | outcome: winner | score: 6 - 4 , 6 - 2 | tournament: mont - de - marsan | surface: hard (i)
- date: 6 june 2006 | opponent: alice canepa | outcome: winner | score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 2 | tournament: cuneo , italy | surface: clay

2) Check how losses are represented in this table
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT outcome FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;

Results:
- runner - up
- winner

Interpretation: “runner - up” is used for losses; “winner” for wins.

3) Count losses vs those opponents
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS loss_count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
WHERE (opponent ILIKE '%Kravets%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Canepa%')
  AND outcome = 'runner - up';

Result:
- loss_count: 0

Analysis
- The dataset shows two matches against the named opponents, both wins for Voskoboeva. There are zero losses to compute any losing margin from, let alone an average of “only 4 point(s).” Therefore the core claim that she “lose[s] … against Oleksandra Kravets and Alice Canepa” is not supported by the data, and any average losing margin is undefined in this dataset.

Assumptions noted
- Outcome labels: Treated “runner - up” as a loss and “winner” as a win based on distinct values in the table.
- The phrase “4 point” is ambiguous in tennis context; regardless of whether it means games, points, or another margin, the absence of any losses renders the claim about an average losing margin unsupported.
- Names were matched case-insensitively and by substring to account for casing and spacing variations.
