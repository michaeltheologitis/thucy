Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate any tables with entertainment titles and US viewership metrics.
- Queried the relevant table for an entry titled “Rabid” and extracted its US viewers (million).

Data source discovery
- Accessible data source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact), schema: public. Only one table available: smallville_season_9, which includes columns for episode title and “us viewers (million)”.

Schema details (relevant)
- Table: public.smallville_season_9
  Columns: no, -, title, directed by, written by, us air date, production code, us viewers (million)

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE title ILIKE '%Rabid%';

- Result row:
  • no: 177
  • -: 3
  • title: rabid
  • directed by: michael rohl
  • written by: jordan hawley
  • us air date: october 9 , 2009
  • production code: 3x5253
  • us viewers (million): 2.3

Assessment
- The table shows the Smallville Season 9 episode titled “Rabid” had 2.3 million US viewers. This matches the claim of “2.30 million” US viewers (formatting difference only).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the available source.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the title rabid” as referring to the Smallville Season 9 episode “Rabid,” as this is the only relevant entry available in the connected data source and it contains a US viewership metric.
