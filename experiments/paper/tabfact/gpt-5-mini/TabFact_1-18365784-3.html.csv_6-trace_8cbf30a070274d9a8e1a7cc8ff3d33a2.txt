Summary conclusion
- The data shows no train operated by FGW (First Great Western). All rows list operator = gnr.
- The only Monday-tagged departure is 11.37 (mon), not 11.02. The 11.02 departure exists, but its operator is gnr, not fgw.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL (TabFact) with public schema.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: "departure" (text), "going to" (text), "calling at" (text), "arrival" (double precision), "operator" (text)

Evidence queries and results
1) Inspect sample rows to understand formats
Executed SQL:
SELECT "departure", "going to", "calling at", "arrival", "operator" FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 50;
Key returned rows (subset shown here):
- 5) departure: 11.02 | operator: gnr
- 7) departure: 11.37 (mon) | operator: gnr
Observation: Times are formatted like HH.MM; day-of-week appears in parentheses when applicable (e.g., (mon), (fri)). All sampled operators are gnr.

2) Find any departure including 11.02 and list its operator; also list Monday-only services
Executed SQL:
SELECT "departure", "operator" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "departure" LIKE '%11.02%';
Result:
- departure: 11.02, operator: gnr
Executed SQL:
SELECT "departure", "operator" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "departure" ILIKE '%(mon)%';
Result:
- departure: 11.37 (mon), operator: gnr
Observation: The 11.02 service exists but is not marked Monday-only; the Monday-specific service at around that time is 11.37 (mon), and its operator is gnr.

3) Check which operators exist in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT operator, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.my_info_table
GROUP BY operator
ORDER BY count DESC, operator;
Result:
- operator: gnr, count: 21
Observation: No other operator values appear; specifically, no fgw.

4) Explicitly search for any occurrence of 'fgw' in all text columns
Executed SQL:
SELECT "departure", "going to", "calling at", "arrival", "operator",
       array_remove(ARRAY[
         CASE WHEN "departure" ILIKE '%fgw%' THEN 'departure' END,
         CASE WHEN "going to" ILIKE '%fgw%' THEN 'going to' END,
         CASE WHEN "calling at" ILIKE '%fgw%' THEN 'calling at' END,
         CASE WHEN "operator" ILIKE '%fgw%' THEN 'operator' END
       ], NULL) AS matched_cols
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "departure" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "going to" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "calling at" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "operator" ILIKE '%fgw%';
Result: 0 rows
Executed SQL (confirmation count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "departure" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "going to" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "calling at" ILIKE '%fgw%'
   OR "operator" ILIKE '%fgw%';
Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion
- The claim that the train departing on Monday at 11:02 is operated by FGW is contradicted by the data. The 11:02 service exists with operator gnr, and the only Monday-tagged service near that time is 11.37 (mon), also operated by gnr. There is no mention of fgw anywhere in the dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the train record(s) in public.my_info_table.
- Treated 'Monday' as indicated by the substring '(mon)' in the departure field.
- Considered the 11.02 departure exactly as the text '11.02' in the departure field.
