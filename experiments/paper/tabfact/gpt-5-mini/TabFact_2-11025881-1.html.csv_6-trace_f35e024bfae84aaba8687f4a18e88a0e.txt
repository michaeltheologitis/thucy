Claim: “west germany have 2 of the top 6 and win a gold medal.”

Findings based on the TabFact database (public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships):
- West Germany has 2 athletes within the top 6 finishers (ranks 4 and 6: Norbert Schramm and Stephan Bril).
- The gold medal (rank 1) was won by Mark Cockerell from the United States, not West Germany.

Evidence with exact executed SQL and results:
1) Identify the top 6 finishers
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE rank IS NOT NULL AND rank <= 6
ORDER BY rank;
Results:
[{"name":"mark cockerell","nation":"united states","places":11,"points":172.42,"rank":1,"sp + fs":1},
 {"name":"takashi mura","nation":"japan","places":24,"points":165.7,"rank":2,"sp + fs":2},
 {"name":"brian pockar","nation":"canada","places":23,"points":166.62,"rank":3,"sp + fs":3},
 {"name":"norbert schramm","nation":"west germany","places":40,"points":159.8,"rank":4,"sp + fs":4},
 {"name":"andrew bestwick","nation":"united kingdom","places":48,"points":158.1,"rank":5,"sp + fs":5},
 {"name":"stephan bril","nation":"west germany","places":57,"points":155.72,"rank":6,"sp + fs":7}]

2) Count how many of the top 6 are from West Germany
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS west_germany_top6_count
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE rank IS NOT NULL AND rank <= 6 AND nation = 'west germany';
Result:
[{"west_germany_top6_count":2}]

3) Determine the nation of the gold medalist (rank 1)
SQL:
SELECT nation FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = 1;
Result:
[{"nation":"united states"}]

Conclusion:
- True: West Germany has 2 of the top 6 finishers.
- False: West Germany did not win the gold medal; the United States did.

Assumptions:
- The table represents the (men’s) results of the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships and is the authoritative source for this verification.
