Claim to verify: “miguel zapata have exactly 24 goal under his name.”

Data source exploration
- Available data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table (sports-related): public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b with columns: goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision), team (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Search for any record containing “Miguel Zapata” (case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE '%Miguel Zapata%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata; goals: 17; matches: 28; average: 0.61; team: atlético ciudad

2) Verify exact (case-insensitive) match and uniqueness:
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE lower(goalkeeper) = lower('Miguel Zapata');
Returned: {"count": 1}

SQL executed:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE lower(goalkeeper) = lower('Miguel Zapata');
Returned: {"goalkeeper": "miguel zapata", "goals": 17}

3) Check for any other “Zapata” entries:
SQL executed:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, team
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE '%zapata%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata; goals: 17; matches: 28; team: atlético ciudad

Conclusion
- The only “Miguel Zapata” record in the available authoritative dataset shows 17 goals, not 24. Therefore, the claim that he has exactly 24 goals is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (2008–09 Segunda División B goalkeeper table). The “goals” column is taken as recorded in this table for the player named “Miguel Zapata.” No other data sources were available to check alternative competitions or seasons.
