Claim to verify: “the screening that start on May 3rd, 2006 end on March 29, 2006.”

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (postgres_tabfact10), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns:
  - "screening started" (text)
  - "screening completed" (text)
  - "chapter unfrozen" (text)
  - "chapter opened" (text)
  - "chapter closed" (text)

What I checked and why
1) Determine the date format stored in the screening fields to craft accurate searches.
2) Search for any entries in 2006 to see nearby dates present and confirm whether May 3, 2006 or March 29, 2006 exists in either field.
3) Directly test for the existence of a screening that starts on 3 May 2006 and ends on 29 March 2006.
4) Broaden searches to include multiple textual variants (ordinals, commas, month-first vs day-first) for both dates.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Inspect distinct values in "screening started" to understand format
SQL:
SELECT "screening started", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.my_info_table
GROUP BY "screening started"
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 50;
Result highlights (sample): values like "21 june 2006", "16 february 2006", "18 may 2006", "27 march 2006", "9 march 2006", "3 april 2006"; also some non-date tokens. Format is typically “day monthname year” in lowercase.

2) Inspect distinct values in "screening completed"
SQL:
SELECT "screening completed", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.my_info_table
GROUP BY "screening completed"
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 50;
Result highlights (sample): values like "5 may 2006", "2 june 2006", "3 march 2006", "22 march 2006", "23 march 2006", "30 june 2006"; some non-date tokens.

3) List rows where either screening field contains 2006
SQL:
SELECT "screening started","screening completed","chapter unfrozen","chapter opened","chapter closed"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening started" ILIKE '%2006%'
   OR "screening completed" ILIKE '%2006%';
Result (15 rows): includes pairs such as
- "18 may 2006" → "30 june 2006"
- "27 march 2006" → "5 may 2006"
- "3 april 2006" → "2 june 2006"
- "9 march 2006" → "28 april 2006"
- "8 february 2006" → "22 march 2006"
- "16 february 2006" → "23 march 2006"
- No entries show "3 may 2006" or "29 march 2006".

4) Direct exact-date match for both dates (allow optional leading zero; case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening started" ~* '^0?3\s+May\s+2006$'
  AND "screening completed" ~* '^0?29\s+March\s+2006$';
Result: 0 rows.

5) Direct exact-date match for start date alone
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening started" ~* '^0?3\s+May\s+2006$';
Result: 0 rows.

6) Direct exact-date match for end date alone
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening completed" ~* '^0?29\s+March\s+2006$';
Result: 0 rows.

7) Broader substring searches for multiple variants (ordinals and commas; month-first and day-first)
SQL (May 3, 2006 variants count):
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ("screening started" ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['%3 may 2006%','%3rd may 2006%','%3rd may, 2006%','%3 may, 2006%','%may 3 2006%','%may 3rd 2006%','%may 3, 2006%','%may 3rd, 2006%']) OR "screening completed" ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['%3 may 2006%','%3rd may 2006%','%3rd may, 2006%','%3 may, 2006%','%may 3 2006%','%may 3rd 2006%','%may 3, 2006%','%may 3rd, 2006%'])) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS may_matches FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: may_matches = 0

SQL (March 29, 2006 variants count):
SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN ("screening started" ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['%29 march 2006%','%29th march 2006%','%29th march, 2006%','%29 march, 2006%','%march 29 2006%','%march 29th 2006%','%march 29, 2006%','%march 29th, 2006%']) OR "screening completed" ILIKE ANY (ARRAY['%29 march 2006%','%29th march 2006%','%29th march, 2006%','%29 march, 2006%','%march 29 2006%','%march 29th 2006%','%march 29, 2006%','%march 29th, 2006%'])) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS march29_matches FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: march29_matches = 0

Conclusion
- There is no evidence in the authoritative dataset of any screening that started on May 3, 2006, nor any that ended on March 29, 2006. Consequently, a screening that both starts on May 3, 2006 and ends on March 29, 2006 does not exist in the data. The claim is not supported.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the "screening started" and "screening completed" fields in public.my_info_table as the authoritative record of screening dates.
- Dates are stored as text; matching was performed case-insensitively and included multiple textual variants to mitigate formatting differences. The dataset appears to use English month names in “day month year” format.
