Claim interpreted: In the available data, there are more BRM entries than any other constructor, and Alfa Romeo and Matra tie for the fewest entries.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Available table: t_1971_south_african_grand_prix with columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence
1) Constructor entry counts
- SQL executed:
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY constructor
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result:
  • march - ford: 4
  • brabham - ford: 3
  • ferrari: 3
  • mclaren - ford: 3
  • brm: 3
  • surtees - ford: 3
  • lotus - ford: 2
  • tyrrell - ford: 2
  • matra: 1
  • march - alfa romeo: 1

- SQL executed (unique constructors):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT constructor) AS unique_constructors
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- Result: 10

- SQL executed (null check):
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE constructor IS NULL) AS null_constructors
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- Result: 0

2) Max/min constructors
- SQL executed (counts ordered):
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY constructor
ORDER BY cnt DESC, constructor;

- SQL executed (max/min values):
SELECT MAX(cnt) AS max_cnt, MIN(cnt) AS min_cnt
FROM (
  SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  GROUP BY constructor
) sub;

- SQL executed (constructors with max = 4):
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY constructor
HAVING COUNT(*) = 4
ORDER BY constructor;
- Result: march - ford (4)

- SQL executed (constructors with min = 1):
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY constructor
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
ORDER BY constructor;
- Result: march - alfa romeo (1), matra (1)

3) Alfa Romeo mention check
- SQL executed:
SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE lower(constructor) LIKE '%alfa romeo%'
GROUP BY constructor
ORDER BY cnt DESC, constructor;
- Result: march - alfa romeo — 1

Findings
- “More BRM than any other”: False. BRM has 3 entries; the maximum is 4 for “march - ford.” Several other constructors also have 3.
- “Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least”: Supported. The least count is 1, shared by “matra” and “march - alfa romeo.” Note the constructor string includes “march - alfa romeo,” not a standalone “alfa romeo.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to constructor frequencies within the single available table t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (1971 South African Grand Prix entries), not across broader seasons or datasets.
- “Alfa Romeo” refers to the entry recorded as “march - alfa romeo,” which is the only occurrence containing “alfa romeo.”
