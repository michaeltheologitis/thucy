Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered one accessible database: postgres_tabfact1 (TabFact), schema public, containing a single table: csi_franchise.

Relevant schema (public.csi_franchise):
- season (bigint)
- episodes (bigint)
- time slot (est) (text)
- season premiere (text)
- season finale (text)
- tv season (text)
- rank (bigint)
- viewers (in millions) (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Exact-match check for the date string "May 26, 2010"
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM csi_franchise WHERE "season finale" = 'May 26, 2010';
Result:
count = 0

2) Identify how 2010 dates are stored in the table
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "season finale" FROM csi_franchise WHERE "season finale" ILIKE '%2010%';
Result:
season finale = may 26 , 2010

3) Count rows whose season finale equals May 26, 2010 using normalized comparison
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM csi_franchise WHERE lower(trim("season finale")) = 'may 26 , 2010';
Result:
count = 1

4) List the matching season(s)
SQL executed:
SELECT season, "season finale" FROM csi_franchise WHERE lower(trim("season finale")) = 'may 26 , 2010';
Result:
season = 6, season finale = may 26 , 2010

Conclusion:
- Within the available data (csi_franchise table), there is exactly 1 season finale on May 26, 2010, not more than one. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope:
- Scope is limited to the csi_franchise table discovered in the available data sources. If the claim intended to refer to all television shows broadly, such data are not present in the accessible sources. The verdict is rendered strictly based on the csi_franchise dataset.
- Date matching was performed case-insensitively and with minor whitespace normalization to account for the stored format "may 26 , 2010".
