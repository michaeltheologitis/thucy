Evidence 2 — Top finishers by rank (context check):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "rank", name, nation, points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships ORDER BY "rank" ASC LIMIT 3;

  1) linda fratianne — united states — 186.92 points
  2) anett pötzsch — east germany — 184.36 points
  3) emi watanabe — japan — 180.52 points

Conclusion: The data shows Linda Fratianne ranked 1st (winner) and Anett Pötzsch ranked 2nd at the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships, matching the claim.
