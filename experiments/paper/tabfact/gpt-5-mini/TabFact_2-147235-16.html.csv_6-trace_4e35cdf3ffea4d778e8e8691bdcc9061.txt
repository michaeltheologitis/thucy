Claim interpreted: “The relative value for 厘 and 分 are different from each other.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data environment: TabFact PostgreSQL instance, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement with columns: jyutping, character, portuguese, relative value, metric value, imperial value.

Evidence
1) Query to compare the recorded relative values for 厘 and 分
SQL:
SELECT character, "relative value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('厘','分');
Result:
- 厘 → 1 / 1600
- 分 → 1 / 1600

2) Full rows for additional context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public."chinese_units_of_measurement" WHERE "character" IN ('厘', '分');
Result rows:
- {character: '厘', jyutping: 'lei4', portuguese: 'liz', "relative value": '1 / 1600', "metric value": '37.79931 mg', "imperial value": '~0.2133 dr'}
- {character: '分', jyutping: 'fan1', portuguese: 'condorim', "relative value": '1 / 1600', "metric value": '377.9936375 mg', "imperial value": '~0.2133 dr'}

Assessment
- The authoritative table records the same relative value (“1 / 1600”) for both 厘 and 分. Therefore, based strictly on the data, their relative values are not different from each other.

Conclusion
- The claim that the relative values are different is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpret the user’s statement as a claim to be verified: that 厘 and 分 have different “relative value” entries in the dataset.
- I take the table’s “relative value” column at face value as the reference for this verification.
