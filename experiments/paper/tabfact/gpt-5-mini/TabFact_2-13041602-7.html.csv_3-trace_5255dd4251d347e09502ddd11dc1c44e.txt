Summary conclusion: Verified. The 2005 Milwaukee Brewers played the Cardinals and then, the very next calendar day, played the Reds (September 25 → September 26, 2005).

Data sources explored
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema).
- Located relevant table via schema inspection: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season (columns: date [text], opponent [text], score [text], loss [text], attendance [bigint], record [text]).

Method
- Identify games against opponents containing “Cardinal” or “Red” and order by actual calendar date (parsing the text date field as 2005 dates).
- Explicitly detect any 1-day adjacency where a Cardinals game is followed by a Reds game.

Evidence
1) List Cardinals/Reds games ordered by calendar date
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%cardinal%' OR opponent ILIKE '%red%'
ORDER BY to_date(initcap(date) || ' 2005','Month DD YYYY');
Result (excerpt illustrating the relevant stretch):
- september 23 — cardinals
- september 24 — cardinals
- september 25 — cardinals
- september 26 — reds
- september 27 — reds
- september 28 — reds
- september 29 — reds

2) Directly find 1-day adjacency: Cardinals → Reds
Executed SQL:
WITH games AS (
  SELECT date, opponent, to_date(initcap(date) || ' 2005','Month DD YYYY')::date AS game_date
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
)
SELECT c.date AS cardinals_date, c.opponent AS cardinals_opponent, c.game_date AS cardinals_game_date,
       r.date AS reds_date, r.opponent AS reds_opponent, r.game_date AS reds_game_date
FROM games c
JOIN games r ON r.game_date = c.game_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE c.opponent ILIKE '%Cardinals%' AND r.opponent ILIKE '%Reds%'
ORDER BY c.game_date;
Result:
- cardinals_date: september 25 (cardinals) — cardinals_game_date: 2005-09-25
- reds_date:      september 26 (reds)      — reds_game_date:      2005-09-26

Conclusion
- The data show the Brewers played the Cardinals on September 25, 2005, and the Reds on September 26, 2005—i.e., Cardinals 1 day before Reds. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Cardinal” refers to the St. Louis Cardinals and “Red” refers to the Cincinnati Reds.
- “1 day before” means consecutive calendar days.
- The date column stores month/day text for 2005; I parsed it by appending the year 2005 when converting to dates.
