Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact16 (TabFact), schema: public.
- Available table: public.my_info_table with columns: game (bigint), march (bigint), opponent (text), score (text), record (text), points (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Overview of distinct opponents and their points
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent, points FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY points ASC, opponent ASC;
Result (excerpt around the relevant value):
- detroit red wings — 59
- california golden seals — 60
- minnesota north stars — 60
- new york rangers — 61
- pittsburgh penguins — 61
- toronto maple leafs — 63
- boston bruins — 65
- new york rangers — 65
- montreal canadiens — 66
- toronto maple leafs — 66
- chicago black hawks — 67
- minnesota north stars — 67
- pittsburgh penguins — 69

2) Count of distinct opponents with exactly 63 points
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS distinct_opponent_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE points = 63;
Result:
- distinct_opponent_count = 1

3) Which opponent(s) have 63 points
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE points = 63 ORDER BY opponent;
Result:
- toronto maple leafs

4) Check for all rows mentioning Toronto to see other point values (sanity check)
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE opponent ILIKE '%toronto%';
Results:
- toronto maple leafs, 63
- toronto maple leafs, 66

Conclusion
- The data show that exactly one opponent has 63 points, and that opponent is "toronto maple leafs." No other opponent has 63 points in this dataset. Therefore, the claim that the Toronto Maple Leafs are the only opponent with 63 points is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- "Opponent" refers to the opponent field in public.my_info_table, and "points" refers to the points column in that same table.
- The claim is evaluated strictly against the available dataset (postgres_tabfact16/public.my_info_table).
