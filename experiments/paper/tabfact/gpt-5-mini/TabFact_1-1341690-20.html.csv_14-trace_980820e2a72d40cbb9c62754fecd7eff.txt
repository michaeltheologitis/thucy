Claim assessed: “Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland’s 7th District, defeating Elton R. Wampler.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table available: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verification of Maryland’s 7th District (1974) and Parren Mitchell’s status
- What we checked: Whether Parren Mitchell was re-elected in MD-7 in 1974 and who the listed candidates were.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  WHERE (district ILIKE '%Maryland%' AND district ILIKE '%7%') OR incumbent ILIKE '%Parren%';
- Result returned:
  { "district": "maryland 7", "incumbent": "parren mitchell", "party": "democratic", "first elected": 1970, "result": "re - elected", "candidates": "parren mitchell (d) unopposed" }
- Interpretation: The data confirms Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland’s 7th District in 1974, and he ran unopposed.

2) Search for any 1974 candidate named “Wampler”
- What we checked: Whether “Elton R. Wampler” appears in the 1974 House election data and, if so, in which district.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Wampler%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Wampler%';
- Result returned:
  - district: maryland 6
    candidates: goodloe byron (d) 73.7% elton r wampler (r) 26.3%
- Interpretation: In 1974, Elton R. Wampler was a Republican candidate in Maryland’s 6th District, not the 7th. Therefore, he was not Parren Mitchell’s opponent in MD-7 that year.

Conclusion
- True: Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland’s 7th District (in 1974).
- Not supported (and contradicted for 1974): That he defeated Elton R. Wampler in MD-7. The 1974 data shows Mitchell was unopposed in MD-7, while Wampler ran in MD-6.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The claim lacks a year; verification is grounded in the available 1974 U.S. House election dataset. Within this authoritative dataset, the defeat of Elton R. Wampler by Parren Mitchell in MD-7 does not occur.
- “Maryland district 7” is interpreted as the U.S. House of Representatives MD-7 congressional district.
