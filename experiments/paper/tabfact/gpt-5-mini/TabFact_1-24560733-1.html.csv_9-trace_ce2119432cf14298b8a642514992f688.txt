Claim interpreted: “The most the Wildcats outscored an opponent was by 26 points.” Interpreted within the available data as referring to the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team (the only accessible ‘Wildcats’ dataset).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team (columns: game, date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents, record)

Evidence:
1) Find the maximum point differential (Wildcats points − Opponents points)
SQL:
SELECT MAX("wildcats points" - opponents) AS max_diff FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result:
[{"max_diff": 36}]

2) List the game(s) where this maximum occurred
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, ("wildcats points" - opponents) AS diff
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
WHERE ("wildcats points" - opponents) = (
  SELECT MAX("wildcats points" - opponents) FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
)
ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date": "nov 15", "opponent": "evansville", "wildcats points": 36, "opponents": 0, "diff": 36}]

Conclusion:
- The largest victory margin in this dataset is 36 points (36–0 vs Evansville on Nov 15), not 26 points. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Wildcats” refers to the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team because this is the only relevant ‘Wildcats’ dataset available via the connected data source.
- Dates and team naming are used as stored in the table.
