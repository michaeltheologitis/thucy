Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: “Paulo Costa (POR) will retire at the end of the season.”
- Finding: In the available authoritative dataset (APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season transfers), Paulo Costa (POR) is listed, but his record shows a move to Anorthosis Famagusta via mutual consent/loan return in the winter window, not retirement. The only retirement entry in the table is for a different player (Machlas).

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: Accessible data source is a PostgreSQL instance (TabFact environment), schema public, with at least one table: t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Table public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season with columns: nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee, source. Content: season-related transfer records for APOEL F.C. in 2008–09.

Evidence query 1: Search for Paulo Costa
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
WHERE (name ILIKE '%costa%' OR nat ILIKE '%costa%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%costa%' OR type ILIKE '%costa%' OR "transfer window" ILIKE '%costa%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%costa%' OR source ILIKE '%costa%' OR name ILIKE '%paulo%' OR source ILIKE '%paulo%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%paulo%');

Result row:
- name: paulo costa
- nat: por
- moving to: anorthosis famagusta
- type: mutual consent loan return
- transfer window: winter
- transfer fee: free
- source: apoelfccomcy

Interpretation: Paulo Costa (POR) transferred to Anorthosis Famagusta; no indication of retirement or end-of-season retirement in his row.

Evidence query 2: Search for retirement/end-of-season mentions
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
WHERE (name ILIKE '%retir%' OR nat ILIKE '%retir%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%retir%' OR type ILIKE '%retir%' OR "transfer window" ILIKE '%retir%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%retir%' OR source ILIKE '%retir%' OR name ILIKE '%end of season%' OR source ILIKE '%end of season%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%end of season%' OR type ILIKE '%end of season%' OR "transfer window" ILIKE '%end of season%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%end of season%' OR name ILIKE '%end of the season%' OR source ILIKE '%end of the season%');

Result row:
- name: machlas
- nat: gre
- moving to: retired
- type: retirement
- transfer window: summer
- transfer fee: -
- source: contragr

Interpretation: The only explicit retirement record in the table is for Machlas, not Paulo Costa.

Conclusion
- The dataset contradicts the claim. Paulo Costa is recorded as transferring (mutual consent loan return) in the winter window, not retiring at season’s end. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Paulo Costa of POR” refers to the Paulo Costa entry present in the APOEL F.C. 2008–09 transfer table (POR = Portugal).
- “End of the season” is interpreted within the context of the 2008–09 season covered by this dataset.
- Only the accessible TabFact public schema was available; conclusions are grounded strictly in this dataset.
