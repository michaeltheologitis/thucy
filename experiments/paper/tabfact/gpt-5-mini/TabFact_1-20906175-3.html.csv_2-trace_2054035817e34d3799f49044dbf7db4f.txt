Claim evaluated: "charley johnson have 2047 attempt"

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table (columns: name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, qb rating) — appears to store quarterback passing statistics.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Locate Charley Johnson and retrieve attempts
SQL executed:
SELECT name, attempts, completions, "completion %", yards, touchdowns, interceptions, "qb rating" 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE name ILIKE '%charley%johnson%';

Result:
{name: "charley johnson", attempts: 2047, completions: 1030, "completion %": "50.3%", yards: 14928, touchdowns: 108, interceptions: 110, "qb rating": 69.6}

2) Confirm available columns (to check for any granularity indicator)
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='my_info_table'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

Result:
name; completions; attempts; completion %; yards; touchdowns; interceptions; qb rating

Assessment:
- The row for "charley johnson" shows attempts = 2047. This directly supports the claim that Charley Johnson has 2047 attempts (interpreted as passing attempts per the table schema).
- The table does not specify whether these statistics are per-season, per-career, or another aggregation level, but this does not affect verification of the numeric value present in the data source.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data returned from the authoritative source.

Assumptions:
- "attempt" refers to the "attempts" field in the passing statistics context present in public.my_info_table.
- The name match uses ILIKE with '%charley%johnson%', which returned a single record labeled exactly "charley johnson".
