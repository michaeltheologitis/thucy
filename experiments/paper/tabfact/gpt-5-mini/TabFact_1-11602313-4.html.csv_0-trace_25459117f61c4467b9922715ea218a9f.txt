Claim: “the pentium dual - core t3200 have a frequency of 2 ghz.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: postgres_tabfact30 (TabFact), schema public.

Schema inspection:
- Table identified: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
  - Relevant columns: "model number" (text), "frequency" (text), along with other CPU specs.

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "model number", "frequency"
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
  WHERE "model number" ILIKE '%T3200%';

- Result:
  pentium dual - core t3200 — 2 ghz

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 with a frequency of “2 ghz,” directly matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Frequency” in the dataset denotes the processor’s base clock speed. The claim is interpreted as referring to base frequency.
