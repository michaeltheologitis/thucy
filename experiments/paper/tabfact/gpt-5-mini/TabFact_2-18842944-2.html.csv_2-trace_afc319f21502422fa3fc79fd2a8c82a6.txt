Data source consulted: TabFact PostgreSQL database, schema public, table t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the minimum attendance across all games
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Result:
min_attendance = 36539

2) List the game(s) with that minimum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE attendance = 36539 ORDER BY week;
Result:
week = 11, date = "november 21 , 1976", opponent = "san diego chargers", attendance = 36539

3) Retrieve all games against the New England Patriots with their attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New England Patriots%';
Results:
- week = 7, date = "october 24 , 1976", opponent = "new england patriots", attendance = 45144
- week = 9, date = "november 7 , 1976", opponent = "new england patriots", attendance = 61157
