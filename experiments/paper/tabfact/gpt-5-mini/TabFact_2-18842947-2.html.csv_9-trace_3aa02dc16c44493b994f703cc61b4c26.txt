Claim being evaluated: “the packer score the highest amount of point (6) in a game versus the lion.”

Data source inspected
- Database: postgres_tabfact23 (schema: public)
- Table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Step 1 — Inspect the 1976 Detroit Lions season data to understand opponents and result format
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week;
Key relevant rows returned:
- Week 4 | opponent: green bay packers | result: l 24 - 14
- Week 8 | opponent: green bay packers | result: w 27 - 6
Interpretation: The “result” field begins with W/L and then two scores separated by a hyphen.

Step 2 — Retrieve and parse the two Packers games to extract Lions vs opponent points
Executed SQL 1 (filter Packers games):
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Green Bay%';

Executed SQL 2 (parse numeric scores and assign to Lions vs opponent using the W/L marker):
WITH g AS (
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
    (regexp_matches(result, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1]::int AS num1,
    (regexp_matches(result, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2]::int AS num2
  FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%green bay%'
)
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, num1, num2,
  CASE WHEN lower(trim(result)) LIKE 'w %' THEN GREATEST(num1,num2) ELSE LEAST(num1,num2) END AS lions_points,
  CASE WHEN lower(trim(result)) LIKE 'w %' THEN LEAST(num1,num2) ELSE GREATEST(num1,num2) END AS opponent_points
FROM g
ORDER BY week;

Parsed results and findings:
- Week 4 (Oct 3, 1976): result = “l 24 - 14” → Lions 14, Packers 24
- Week 8 (Oct 31, 1976): result = “w 27 - 6” → Lions 27, Packers 6
Thus, against the Lions in 1976, the Packers’ points in the two games were 24 and 6. Their higher total was 24, not 6.

Conclusion
- False: “the highest amount of point (6) … versus the lion.” The highest points the Packers scored against the Lions in the 1976 season was 24.
- True (supporting detail only): The Packers did score 6 points in one of the games (Week 8), but that was not their highest against the Lions that season.

Assumptions
- “packer” refers to the Green Bay Packers; “lion” refers to the Detroit Lions.
- “highest amount of point” is interpreted as the maximum points the Packers scored in a single game vs the Lions within the available 1976 season dataset.
- Score attribution uses the W/L marker: on “w”, the Lions have the larger number; on “l”, the Lions have the smaller number.
