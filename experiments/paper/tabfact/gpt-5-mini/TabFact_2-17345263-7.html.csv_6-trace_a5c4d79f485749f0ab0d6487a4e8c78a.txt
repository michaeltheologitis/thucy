Scope and data sources explored:
- I ran a discovery and found one accessible data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14), schema public, with a single relevant table: public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99. Columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text).

Evidence collected:
1) Check for any game with attendance = 33,002 (ignoring commas and non-digits)
Executed SQL 1:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE replace(trim(attendance), ',', '') = '33002';
Result: No rows returned.

Executed SQL 2:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE regexp_replace(attendance, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') = '33002';
Result: No rows returned.

Interpretation: Within this dataset, there is no game recorded with attendance equal to 33,002.

2) Check all games against UAB and their attendances
Executed SQL 3:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE '%UAB%';
Result:
- date: october 10; opponent: uab; site: dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc; result: w26 - 7; attendance: 31002

Interpretation: The only UAB game in this dataset shows an attendance of 31,002, not 33,002.

Conclusion:
- There is no evidence of any game with attendance 33,002 in the available table.
- The UAB game recorded has attendance 31,002. Therefore, the claim that UAB was the opponent when the attendance was 33,002 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the East Carolina Pirates football 1990–1999 dataset, asking whether UAB was the opponent in a game with recorded attendance of 33,002, or asserting that they were.
