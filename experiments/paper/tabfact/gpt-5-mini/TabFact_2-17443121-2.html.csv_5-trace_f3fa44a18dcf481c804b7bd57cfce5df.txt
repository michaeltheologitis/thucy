Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the episode titled "gary and allison brooks" is the episode with the fewest viewers in the available data.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: gary_unmarried with columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the minimum viewers value and the corresponding episode(s):
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(viewers) AS min_viewers FROM gary_unmarried;
- Result:
  min_viewers = 5.55

- SQL:
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM gary_unmarried WHERE viewers = (SELECT MIN(viewers) FROM gary_unmarried);
- Result:
  episode = "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal", viewers = 5.55

2) Check episodes mentioning both Gary and Allison (to locate the specific title and its viewers):
- SQL:
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM gary_unmarried WHERE lower(episode) LIKE '%gary%' AND lower(episode) LIKE '%allison%';
- Results:
  - "gary and allison 's restaurant" — viewers: 6.71
  - "gary and allison brooks" — viewers: 8.14
  - "gary hooks up allison" — viewers: 7.57
  - "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal" — viewers: 5.55

Assessment:
- The episode with the fewest viewers is "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal" (5.55).
- The episode titled "gary and allison brooks" has 8.14 viewers, which is not the minimum.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Least amount of viewer" is interpreted as the minimum value in the viewers column within the gary_unmarried table.
- Viewer figures are taken as-is from the viewers column (double precision), which likely represents millions of viewers, consistent across rows.
