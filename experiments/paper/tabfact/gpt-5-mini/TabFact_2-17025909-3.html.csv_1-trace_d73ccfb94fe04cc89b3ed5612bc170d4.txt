Claim: “australia do not receive any gold medal.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21)
- Relevant table: public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships with columns (rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total).

Evidence gathered:
- Query intent: Check Australia’s gold medal count in the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships medal table.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
  FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships
  WHERE nation ILIKE '%Australia%';
- Result:
  rank = 18, nation = australia, gold = 0, silver = 0, bronze = 1, total = 1

Assessment:
- The dataset shows Australia had 0 gold medals in the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships. This directly supports the claim (interpreted in the context of this dataset).

Assumptions:
- Because the only accessible authoritative dataset pertains to the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships, the claim is interpreted as referring to that event/year. No broader inference (e.g., Olympics or all events) is made beyond this dataset.
