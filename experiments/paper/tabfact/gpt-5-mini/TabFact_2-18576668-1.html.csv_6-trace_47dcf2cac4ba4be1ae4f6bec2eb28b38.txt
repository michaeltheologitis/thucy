Claim interpreted: “the only invitational event type be in the 2002 season in Los Angeles.” I take this to mean the dataset should show an Invitational event in Los Angeles during the 2002 season, and that this is the only Invitational entry.

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), schema public, table: tsuyoshi_fujita(season text, "event type" text, location text, format text, date text, rank bigint).

Evidence collected
1) Check for any Los Angeles entries (to see seasons and event types there)
SQL:
SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE location ILIKE '%los angeles%';
Results:
- season: 2005 | event type: invitational | location: los angeles | format: special | date: 17 - 20 may 2005 | rank: 2
- season: 2005 | event type: pro tour     | location: los angeles | format: extended | date: 28 - 30 october 2005 | rank: 5
Interpretation: Los Angeles events in this table occur in 2005, not 2002.

2) Check all Invitational events (to verify where/when they occur)
SQL:
SELECT season, "event type", location, date, rank
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE "event type" = 'invitational';
Result:
- season: 2005 | event type: invitational | location: los angeles | date: 17 - 20 may 2005 | rank: 2
Interpretation: The only Invitational event in the table is in Los Angeles in 2005 (not 2002).

3) Check for any entries with season exactly '2002'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2002';
Result: 0 rows
Interpretation: No entries use plain '2002' as the season value.

4) Inspect how seasons are formatted in this table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY season;
Results:
- 1997 - 98
- 1998 - 99
- 1999 - 00
- 2000 - 01
- 2001 - 02
- 2002 - 03
- 2003 - 04
- 2005
- 2011
Interpretation: Seasons are often recorded as ranges (e.g., 2002 - 03), so we should also check those.

5) Check entries for the 2002-03 season
SQL:
SELECT season, "event type", location FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season LIKE '2002%';
Results:
- season: 2002 - 03 | event type: grand prix | location: utsunomiya
- season: 2002 - 03 | event type: grand prix | location: hiroshima
- season: 2002 - 03 | event type: grand prix | location: bangkok
Interpretation: In the 2002–03 season, events are Grand Prix in Utsunomiya, Hiroshima, and Bangkok—no Los Angeles and no Invitational.

Conclusion
- The only Invitational event in the table is in Los Angeles in 2005, not in 2002 (nor in the 2002–03 season). There are zero rows for 2002 Los Angeles, and 2002–03 Los Angeles does not appear at all. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “2002 season” both as an exact season value '2002' and, given the dataset’s format, as the 2002–03 season. In both interpretations, the dataset does not support the claim.
- Interpreted “the only invitational event type” as referring to the only row with event type = 'invitational' in the table.
