Claim to verify: "the agricultural panel have 2 member and the labour panel have 5 member"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: members_of_the_5th_seanad (contains columns for Agricultural Panel and Labour Panel counts)

Schema (from discovery)
- Columns: party (text), "administrative panel" (bigint), "agricultural panel" (bigint), "cultural and educational panel" (bigint), "industrial and commercial panel" (bigint), "labour panel" (bigint), "national university of ireland" (bigint), "university of dublin" (bigint), "nominated by the taoiseach" (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence from the data
1) Full table contents
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result (abridged to relevant columns):
  {"party":"fianna fáil","agricultural panel":4,"labour panel":0,"total":21}
  {"party":"fine gael","agricultural panel":3,"labour panel":0,"total":9}
  {"party":"labour party","agricultural panel":0,"labour panel":5,"total":8}
  {"party":"clann na talmhan","agricultural panel":2,"labour panel":1,"total":3}
  {"party":"independent","agricultural panel":1,"labour panel":0,"total":9}
  {"party":"total","agricultural panel":11,"labour panel":11,"total":60}

2) Overall counts for the Agricultural Panel and Labour Panel
- SQL executed:
  SELECT party, "agricultural panel", "labour panel", total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE lower(party) LIKE '%total%' OR lower(party) = 'total';
- Result:
  {"party":"total", "agricultural panel":11, "labour panel":11, "total":60}
- Conclusion from this query: The overall counts in the 5th Seanad are Agricultural Panel = 11 members and Labour Panel = 11 members, not 2 and 5.

3) Where the numbers 2 and 5 do appear (to explain potential confusion)
- Labour Party’s members on the Labour Panel
  SQL executed:
  SELECT party, "labour panel", "agricultural panel", total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE lower(party) LIKE '%labour%';
  Result: {"party":"labour party", "labour panel":5, "agricultural panel":0, "total":8}
- Clann na Talmhan’s members on the Agricultural Panel
  SQL executed:
  SELECT party, "agricultural panel", "labour panel", total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE lower(party) LIKE '%talmhan%' OR lower(party) LIKE '%clann%';
  Result: {"party":"clann na talmhan", "agricultural panel":2, "labour panel":1, "total":3}
- These party-specific rows show “5” (Labour Party on the Labour Panel) and “2” (Clann na Talmhan on the Agricultural Panel), but they do not represent total panel membership.

Assessment
- The claim that “the agricultural panel have 2 member and the labour panel have 5 member” is not supported by the data when interpreted as overall panel counts. The correct overall counts are 11 for the Agricultural Panel and 11 for the Labour Panel in this dataset (members of the 5th Seanad).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “agricultural panel” and “labour panel” as the overall panel counts in the members_of_the_5th_seanad table (i.e., totals for that Seanad), since the table explicitly includes a total row. If the intent was to refer to specific parties’ representation on those panels, then the statement mixes two different parties: Clann na Talmhan (2 on Agricultural Panel) and Labour Party (5 on Labour Panel), which are accurate per-party counts but do not reflect total panel sizes.
