Interpretation of the claim/question
- You appear to be asking: In which year did the girls’ doubles pair “Ayu Pratiwi” and “Anggi Widia” coincide with the boys’ doubles pair “Jones Ralfy Jansen” and “Dandi Prabudita” at the Indonesian National Badminton Championships?

Conclusion
- Year: 2009

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Direct check for the year(s) where both pairings occur in the same year
SQL:
SELECT year, "girls doubles", "boys doubles" FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Ayu Pratiwi%' AND "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Anggi Widia%' AND "boys doubles" ILIKE '%Jones Ralfy Jansen%' AND "boys doubles" ILIKE '%Dandi Prabudita%';
Result:
- year: 2009; girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia; boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita

2) Corroborating checks (names found across relevant columns)
2a) Girls’ doubles occurrences for “Ayu Pratiwi” and “Anggi Widia”
SQL:
SELECT year, "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Ayu Pratiwi%' AND "girls doubles" ILIKE '%Anggi Widia%';
Result:
- 2009 — girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia

2b) Boys’ doubles occurrences for “Jones Ralfy Jansen” and/or “Dandi Prabudita” (shows both appear together in 2009 and 2010)
SQL:
SELECT year, "boys doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE lower("boys doubles") LIKE '%jones ralfy jansen%' OR lower("boys doubles") LIKE '%dandi prabudita%';
Results:
- 2009 — boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita
- 2010 — boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita

Why the answer is 2009
- Only 2009 simultaneously has girls’ doubles “ayu pratiwi anggi widia” and boys’ doubles “jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.” In 2010, while the boys’ pair is present, the girls’ doubles winners are different.

Assumptions
- Names were matched case-insensitively using substring matching (ILIKE/LOWER with wildcards), allowing for simple spacing/formatting differences.
- The Indonesian National Badminton Championships table is the authoritative source available and contains year-by-year winners for boys doubles, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.
