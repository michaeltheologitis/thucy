Interpreted claim: There exists a row where played = 114, points = 107, and the value for the 1987 - 88 season equals 31 (in the 1988–89 Argentine Primera División table).

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n
  - Columns: team (text), average (double precision), points (bigint), played (bigint), "1986 - 87" (text), "1987 - 88" (text), "1988 - 89" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Check for an exact match on all three conditions
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE played = 114 AND points = 107 AND "1987 - 88" = '31';
Result:
match_count = 0

2) Inspect rows that match the first two conditions (played = 114, points = 107)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE played = 114 AND points = 107;
Result (one row):
- team: ferro carril oeste
- average: 0.939
- points: 107
- played: 114
- "1986 - 87": 44
- "1987 - 88": 33
- "1988 - 89": 30

Findings
- No row satisfies all three conditions simultaneously (played = 114, points = 107, and 1987 - 88 = 31).
- The closest row (ferro carril oeste) has 1987 - 88 = 33, not 31.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the statement as an assertion about a single row in the table with exact values: played = 114, points = 107, and the text field "1987 - 88" equal to '31'. If a numeric casting of the season column or a different comparison (e.g., >=, <=) was intended, the current evidence targets exact equality in the available dataset.
