Claim: "the carlton center , in cape town , have 50 floor"

Data sources explored:
- postgres_tabfact19.public
- Table: list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa (columns: name, city, years as tallest, metres, feet, floors)

Evidence 1: Locate the Carlton Centre and check its city and floors.
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, city, floors
FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
WHERE name ILIKE '%Carlton Centre%';
Result:
- name: carlton centre | city: johannesburg | floors: 50

Evidence 2: Check for any Cape Town entry named Carlton Centre (and see Cape Town buildings listed).
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, city, floors FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE city ILIKE 'Cape Town';
Result:
- naspers centre | cape town | 22
- mutual heights building | cape town | 18

Assessment:
- Floors: The Carlton Centre has 50 floors. This part of the claim is supported.
- Location: The Carlton Centre is in Johannesburg, not Cape Town. No record shows a "Carlton Centre" in Cape Town.

Conclusion: The claim mixes a correct floor count with an incorrect city.

Assumptions:
- Case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) was used to identify “Carlton Centre.”
- The list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa table is taken as authoritative for building names, cities, and floor counts.
