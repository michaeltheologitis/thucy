Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the relevant schema.
- Queried the fights table to identify the single match with the longest recorded time, then checked whether it was a win against Eugene Jackson.
- Cross-checked by listing all rows against Eugene Jackson.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact
- Discovered table: public.tim_lajcik (owner: guest_user)

Schema details for public.tim_lajcik
- Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text)
- No primary keys or foreign keys.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Longest-time match overall (time parsed as M:SS or MM:SS to total seconds)
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, time,
CASE WHEN trim(time) ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}$' THEN (split_part(trim(time), ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(trim(time), ':', 2)::int) ELSE NULL END AS seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE trim(time) ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}$'
ORDER BY seconds DESC
LIMIT 1;

Result (single row):
- res: win
- opponent: eugene jackson
- event: ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2
- round: 1
- time: 9:49
- seconds: 589

2) All rows where opponent contains 'Eugene Jackson' (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, time,
CASE WHEN trim(time) ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}$' THEN (split_part(trim(time), ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(trim(time), ':', 2)::int) ELSE NULL END AS seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Eugene Jackson%'
ORDER BY seconds DESC NULLS LAST;

Result rows:
- res: win
- opponent: eugene jackson
- event: ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2
- round: 1
- time: 9:49
- seconds: 589

Conclusion
- The match with the longest recorded time in public.tim_lajcik is indeed a win against Eugene Jackson. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “In the available fight record (public.tim_lajcik), the match with the longest recorded fight time is a win against Eugene Jackson.”
- Time parsing considered only values matching M:SS or MM:SS; rows with non-matching time formats were excluded from the max-time computation.
