Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected schema to ground the claim in actual data.
- Queried the only available table (public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season) for transfers marked as occurring at the "end of contract" and counted them.

Data discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact8 (TabFact), schema: public
- Tables found: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  - Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text)

Evidence 1: Distribution of transfer types
SQL executed:
SELECT "type", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
GROUP BY "type"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Results:
- loan — 20 rows
- end of contract — 7 rows
- transfer — 6 rows
Interpretation: There are exactly 7 records where the transfer type is labeled "end of contract" in this dataset.

Evidence 2: Players with type = 'end of contract'
SQL executed:
SELECT name, nat, "moving to", "transfer window", "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE type = 'end of contract';
Rows returned (7 total):
1) name: nicholas gallacher, nat: sco, moving to: motherwell, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
2) name: lacine cherif, nat: ivory coast, moving to: kilmarnock, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
3) name: alistair park, nat: sco, moving to: hibernian, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
4) name: michael donald, nat: eng, moving to: free agent, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
5) name: calum reidford, nat: sco, moving to: dunfermline athletic, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
6) name: chris smith, nat: sco, moving to: greenock morton, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a
7) name: jeroen van den broeck, nat: bel, moving to: agovv, transfer window: summer, transfer fee: n / a

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly 7 players whose move is categorized as "end of contract". This supports the claim that only 7 players were transferred at the end of their contract (within the scope of this table).

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the only available dataset (public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season) and interprets "transfer at the end of their contract" as rows where type = 'end of contract'.
- No broader league/season context is implied beyond this table.
