Claim being checked: “camilo villegas from columbia and david tom from the united state tie for eighth place with + 4 to par.”

What the data shows (2008 PGA Championship table):
- Finishing positions present are 1, T2, T4, T7, and T9. There is no 8th place (nor T8) entry.
- Camilo Villegas and David Toms are both listed as T9, not T8.
- Both have a to-par of +3, not +4.
- Countries listed: Camilo Villegas — Colombia; David Toms — United States.

Conclusion: The claim is incorrect on finishing position (should be T9, not T8) and to-par (should be +3, not +4). Nationalities are correct, though the names and country spellings in the claim are misspelled (“columbia” vs. Colombia; “united state” vs. United States; “david tom” vs. David Toms).

Supporting evidence and exact executed SQL:
1) Distinct finishing places in the table
SQL:
SELECT place, count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY place;
Results:
- place: 1 | cnt: 1
- place: t2 | cnt: 2
- place: t4 | cnt: 3
- place: t7 | cnt: 2
- place: t9 | cnt: 4

2) Verify exact player names present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player FROM t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Villegas%' OR player ILIKE '%Toms%';
Results:
- camilo villegas
- david toms

3) Retrieve rows for Camilo Villegas and David Toms
SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE 'camilo villegas' OR player ILIKE 'david toms';
Results:
- player: camilo villegas | place: t9 | country: colombia | score: 74 + 72 = 67 = 213 | to-par: + 3
- player: david toms      | place: t9 | country: united states | score: 72 + 69 + 72 = 213 | to-par: + 3

Note: In this dataset, ties are denoted with a leading 't' (e.g., t9). There are no rows for 8 or t8.

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the 2008 PGA Championship, matching the available data source (table t_2008_pga_championship).
- Name matching is case-insensitive, consistent with how names are stored in the table.
