Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that the Yugoslavian national team lost a tie against Romania with an aggregate score of 3–4, and also mentions Italy. I verify both the Romania aggregate and any Italy-related result present in the data.

What the data shows
1) Yugoslavia vs Romania — individual matches and aggregate
- Evidence (list Romania matches):
  SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" 
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Romania%';
  Result rows:
  - {date: "march 30", city: "belgrade", opponent: "romania", results: "2:0", type of game: "balkan cup"}
  - {date: "august 27", city: "bucharest , romania", opponent: "romania", results: "1:4", type of game: "balkan cup"}

- Evidence (parse scores and compute aggregate):
  SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results,
         (substring(results from '([0-9]+)')::int) AS yugoslavia_goals,
         (substring(results from '[0-9]+\D+([0-9]+)')::int) AS romania_goals
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Romania%';
  Result rows:
  - {date: "march 30", city: "belgrade", results: "2:0", yugoslavia_goals: 2, romania_goals: 0}
  - {date: "august 27", city: "bucharest , romania", results: "1:4", yugoslavia_goals: 1, romania_goals: 4}

  SQL (aggregate):
  SELECT count(*) AS matches_considered,
         sum((substring(results from '([0-9]+)')::int)) AS total_yugoslavia_goals,
         sum((substring(results from '[0-9]+\D+([0-9]+)')::int)) AS total_romania_goals
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Romania%';
  Result: {matches_considered: 2, total_yugoslavia_goals: 3, total_romania_goals: 4}

Conclusion from (1): Over the two Balkan Cup matches against Romania, Yugoslavia’s aggregate was 3–4; thus Yugoslavia lost the tie on aggregate.

2) Yugoslavia vs Italy — any recorded match
- Evidence:
  SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE lower(opponent) LIKE '%italy%';
  Result row:
  - {date: "november 15", city: "torino , italy", opponent: "italy", results: "0:2", type of game: "1982 wcq"}

Conclusion from (2): There is a separate match where Yugoslavia lost to Italy 0–2 in Torino (1982 World Cup qualifying). This is unrelated to the Romania aggregate.

3) On the phrase “the italy against romania”
- The two Romania matches took place in Belgrade (Yugoslavia) and Bucharest (Romania). No Romania match occurred in Italy in the data shown above. If the claim intended that the Romania tie was decided “in Italy,” that part is not supported by the records.

Overall assessment
- Supported: Yugoslavia lost the tie against Romania on aggregate 3–4 (two Balkan Cup legs: 2–0, then 1–4).
- Supported (as a separate fact): Yugoslavia lost to Italy 0–2 in Torino in 1982 WCQ.
- Not supported: Any linkage implying the Romania aggregate involved playing “in Italy.” The Romania matches were in Belgrade and Bucharest.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “aggregate score of 3:4” as summing the goals across the two recorded Romania matches.
- I interpreted “the italy” as either a separate mention that Yugoslavia lost to Italy (which is true) or an imprecise linkage to the Romania tie’s location (which is not supported).
- Opponent matching used case-insensitive substring queries (ILIKE/LIKE) on the opponent field in the provided Yugoslavia results table.
- The results field is assumed to list Yugoslavia’s goals first and the opponent’s second, which is consistent with all rows shown above.
