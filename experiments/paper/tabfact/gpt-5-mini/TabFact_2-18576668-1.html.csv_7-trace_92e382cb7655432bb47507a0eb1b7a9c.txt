Claim interpreted: The user asserts that seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 are in the limited format.

Data source discovery
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  ORDER BY table_name;
- Result:
  - tsuyoshi_fujita

Schema context
- Relevant columns in public.tsuyoshi_fujita (as used below): season (text), format (text)

Evidence 1: What formats exist for each season
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT season, format FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY season, format;
- Partial results relevant to the claim:
  - 2001 - 02 — limited
  - 2001 - 02 — standard
  - 2001 - 02 — team limited
  - 2002 - 03 — extended
  - 2002 - 03 — limited
  - 2002 - 03 — standard
  - 2003 - 04 — special
  - 2003 - 04 — standard

Evidence 2: Do these seasons have a format that includes the word “limited”?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT season, format
  FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
  WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04')
    AND LOWER(format) LIKE '%limited%'
  ORDER BY season;
- Results:
  - 2001 - 02 — limited
  - 2001 - 02 — team limited
  - 2002 - 03 — limited
  - (No rows for 2003 - 04)

Evidence 3: What formats exist for 2003 - 04 specifically?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT format FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2003 - 04';
- Results:
  - special
  - standard

Conclusion
- Supported: 2001 - 02 has limited (and team limited).
- Supported: 2002 - 03 has limited.
- Not supported: 2003 - 04 does not have any limited-type format (only special and standard are present).

Final assessment: The statement that all three seasons are in the limited format is only partly true; 2003 - 04 is not in limited format according to the data.

Assumptions
- I treated the available TabFact table public.tsuyoshi_fujita as the authoritative dataset for this verification.
- I interpreted “limited format” as the format value equal to “limited”; I also checked for any format containing the substring “limited” (e.g., “team limited”) to be thorough.
