Claim interpreted: The user asks whether Ben Gordon (17) had the high rebounds in the game where Rodney Stuckey (16) had the high points for the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season.

Findings:
- There is exactly one game in this dataset where the "high points" entry is Rodney Stuckey (16). In that game, the "high rebounds" entry is Greg Monroe (7), not Ben Gordon (17).
- A direct existence check confirms there are no games where the high points field contains Rodney Stuckey (16) and the high rebounds field contains Ben Gordon (17).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate all games where Rodney Stuckey appears in the high points field (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points", "high rebounds"
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Stuckey%';
Result excerpt (relevant row):
- Game 3 | date: october 11 | score: w 94 - 85 (ot) | high points: rodney stuckey (16) | high rebounds: greg monroe (7)

2) Target the specific entry where high points is Rodney Stuckey (16) to confirm the paired high rebounds:
SQL:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points", "high rebounds"
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE lower("high points") = 'rodney stuckey (16)'
   OR lower("high points") LIKE '%rodney stuckey (16)%';
Result:
- game: 3
- date: october 11
- score: w 94 - 85 (ot)
- high points: rodney stuckey (16)
- high rebounds: greg monroe (7)

3) Direct existence check for any game with high points = Rodney Stuckey and high rebounds = Ben Gordon (case-insensitive substring match):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Rodney Stuckey%'
  AND "high rebounds" ILIKE '%Ben Gordon%';
Result:
- match_count = 0

Conclusion:
- In the only game where Rodney Stuckey had the high points with 16, the high rebounds were by Greg Monroe (7), not Ben Gordon (17). Therefore, the claim that Ben Gordon (17) had the high rebounds in that game is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Numbers in parentheses in the table represent the stat totals (e.g., points or rebounds).
- Matching was done case-insensitively to accommodate the table’s lowercase formatting.
- The scope is limited to the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season table available (public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season).
