Summary
- Claim interpreted: The Dundee Hurricanes’ highest number of ties in any season occurred in 2008.
- Conclusion: Supported by data; 2008 has the maximum ties (3), and no other season matches or exceeds this.

Data source exploration
- Available data source discovered: PostgreSQL instance postgres_tabfact29 (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.dundee_hurricanes with columns: season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes.

Evidence
1) Determine the maximum number of ties across all seasons
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(ties) AS max_ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes;
Result:
[{"max_ties": 3}]

2) List the season(s) that have that maximum number of ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE ties = 3 ORDER BY season;
Result:
[{"season": 2008, "ties": 3}]

3) Explicitly confirm whether 2008 has the maximum number of ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS(
  SELECT 1 FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2008 AND ties = (SELECT MAX(ties) FROM public.dundee_hurricanes)
) THEN true ELSE false END AS is_2008_among_max;
Result:
[{"is_2008_among_max": true}]

Assessment
- The maximum ties recorded for the Dundee Hurricanes in the dataset is 3.
- The only season with 3 ties is 2008.
- Therefore, the highest number of ties in a season for the Hurricanes occurred in 2008, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes team represented by the table public.dundee_hurricanes.
- “tie” refers to the ties column in that table.
- “season” corresponds to the season field in the same table.
