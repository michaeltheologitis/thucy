Claim: “the total attendance for week 8 be 61603.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a relevant table: t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season.
- Schema (from metadata): columns = week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the row for week 8
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE week = 8;
Result row:
{ week: 8, date: "october 22 , 2000", opponent: "denver broncos", result: "w 31 - 21", attendance: 61603 }

2) Confirm by summing attendance for week 8
SQL:
SELECT SUM(attendance) AS total_attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE week = 8;
Result:
{ total_attendance: 61603 }

Analysis:
- The single row for week 8 shows attendance = 61,603.
- The aggregate SUM over week 8 also equals 61,603, confirming the total attendance for that week in this dataset.

Conclusion: The data supports the claim that the total attendance for week 8 is 61,603.

Assumptions:
- “Week 8” refers to the value 8 in the column week of the table t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season.
- “Total attendance” for that week is the sum of attendance across all rows with week = 8 (there is one such row in this dataset).
