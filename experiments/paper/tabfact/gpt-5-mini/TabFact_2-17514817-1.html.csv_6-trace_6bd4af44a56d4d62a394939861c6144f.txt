Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery's Dr Hexter's Healer beer has only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data environment: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema. Accessible table: public.west_berkshire_brewery.
- Schema (public.west_berkshire_brewery): columns — year (bigint), "beer name" (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text).

Step 1 — Identify exact beer-name variants for Dr Hexter’s Healer
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "beer name" FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE "beer name" ILIKE '%hexter%';
Results:
- dr hexter 's healer
- dr hexter 's wedding ale

Step 2 — Retrieve all awards for Dr Hexter’s Healer between 1995 and 2009
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition
FROM west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE "beer name" ILIKE 'Dr Hexter%Healer'
ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1997 — dr hexter 's healer — runner up — beer of the festival — camra northamptonshire branch beer festival
- 2002 — dr hexter 's healer — silver medal — strong ale — siba south east region beer competition
- 2008 — dr hexter 's healer — gold medal — best local beer — camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 — dr hexter 's healer — gold medal — best local beer — camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 — dr hexter 's healer — gold medal — in category — camra london and south east regional competition

Assessment
- The beer did receive a silver medal (in 2002). However, within 1995–2009 it also received runner up (1997) and multiple gold medals (2008, 2009). Therefore, it did not “only” receive a silver medal during that period.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Only received a silver medal” is interpreted as receiving silver-tier awards exclusively (and no other award tiers) within 1995–2009.
- The timeframe is inclusive of 1995 and 2009.
- Matching for Dr Hexter’s Healer used a case-insensitive pattern (ILIKE 'Dr Hexter%Healer') to account for punctuation/spacing in the stored name.
