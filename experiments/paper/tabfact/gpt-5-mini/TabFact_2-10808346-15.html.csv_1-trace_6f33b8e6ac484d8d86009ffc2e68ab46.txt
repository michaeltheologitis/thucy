Claim interpreted: “At Punt Road Oval, Melbourne was Richmond’s away-team opponent.”

Evidence from the available data (TabFact, public.t_1943_vfl_season):

1) Identify how the venue appears in the data
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%punt road%';
- Result:
  - punt road oval

2) Retrieve the full record(s) for matches at Punt Road Oval
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE TRIM(LOWER(venue)) = 'punt road oval';
- Result (one row):
  - date: 21 august 1943
  - home team: richmond
  - home team score: 15.19 (109)
  - away team: melbourne
  - away team score: 12.13 (85)
  - venue: punt road oval
  - crowd: 9000

3) Check if Richmond was ever the away team at Punt Road Oval (to rule out misinterpretation)
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season
WHERE trim(lower("venue")) = 'punt road oval'
  AND trim(lower("away team")) = 'richmond';
- Result:
  - match_count = 0

Conclusion:
- The dataset records one match at Punt Road Oval in the 1943 VFL season: Richmond (home) vs Melbourne (away). Thus, at Punt Road Oval, the away team opponent facing Richmond was Melbourne. This supports the interpreted claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted as: “At Punt Road Oval, the away team opponent of Richmond was Melbourne.”
- Matching for venue/team names was done case-insensitively with trimmed whitespace.
- Evidence is limited to the 1943 VFL season table available in the data source.
