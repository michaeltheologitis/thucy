Claim interpreted: “the prince park venue have just as much crowd as the junction oval [venue].” I evaluate “just as much crowd” as equality in attendance (crowd) for the records available.

Data source exploration
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL source (TabFact) with public schema. A relevant table exists: public.t_1975_vfl_season with columns: home team, away team, venue, crowd, date.

Step 1: Identify relevant venues in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season ORDER BY venue;
Results:
["junction oval", "kardinia park", "mcg", "moorabbin oval", "princes park", "vfl park"]

Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY venue ORDER BY cnt DESC, venue;
Results (venue, cnt):
- junction oval: 1
- kardinia park: 1
- mcg: 1
- moorabbin oval: 1
- princes park: 1
- vfl park: 1
Interpretation: Both “princes park” and “junction oval” appear once in this dataset.

Step 2: Retrieve and compare crowd figures for the two venues
Executed SQL (venue existence check, case-insensitive):
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE lower(venue) IN ('princes park','junction oval');

Executed SQL (crowd values with context):
SELECT venue, crowd, date, "home team", "away team" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE lower(venue) IN ('princes park','junction oval') ORDER BY date;
Results:
- princes park — crowd = 23830 (Hawthorn vs Collingwood, 7 June 1975)
- junction oval — crowd = 16249 (Fitzroy vs Carlton, 7 June 1975)

Assessment
- Equality check: 23830 ≠ 16249. Therefore, in the available data, Princes Park did not have “just as much crowd” as Junction Oval; it had a higher crowd.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Just as much crowd” is interpreted as equal attendance for the matches represented in this dataset.
- Venue names matched case-insensitively; the dataset stores them as lowercase strings (“princes park”, “junction oval”).
- The verification is based solely on the t_1975_vfl_season table available; each venue appears once in this table, so the comparison reflects those recorded matches, not a broader season aggregate beyond this dataset.
