Claim to verify: "only 1 of the viral disease have be assign to a family"

Data source discovery
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact via postgres_tabfact7), public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection:
  - Table: public.viral_disease
    - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Total number of records in public.viral_disease
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS total_records FROM public.viral_disease;
- Result: total_records = 23

2) Number of records where family is assigned (non-null and not empty)
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS family_assigned FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND trim(both from family) <> '';
- Result: family_assigned = 23

3) Distinct non-empty family values with counts
- SQL: SELECT trim(both from family) AS family, count(*) AS cnt FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND trim(both from family) <> '' GROUP BY trim(both from family) ORDER BY cnt DESC, family;
- Result (family : count):
  adenoviridae : 1
  arenaviridae : 1
  astroviridae : 1
  bunyaviridae : 1
  caliciviridae : 1
  coronaviridae : 1
  filoviridae : 1
  flaviviridae : 1
  hepadnaviridae : 1
  hepeviridae : 1
  herpesviridae : 1
  orthomyxoviridae : 1
  papillomaviridae : 1
  paramyxoviridae : 1
  parvoviridae : 1
  picornaviridae : 1
  polyomaviridae : 1
  poxviridae : 1
  reoviridae : 1
  retroviridae : 1
  rhabdoviridae : 1
  togaviridae : 1
  unassigned : 1

4) Specific check for 'unassigned' vs named families
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_unassigned_exact FROM viral_disease WHERE family = 'unassigned';
- Result: 1
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_not_unassigned_ci FROM viral_disease WHERE lower(coalesce(family, '')) <> 'unassigned';
- Result: 22

5) Count rows with a specific named family (non-null, not empty, not 'unassigned')
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS named_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND trim(family) <> '' AND lower(trim(family)) <> 'unassigned';
- Result: named_family_count = 22
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS null_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NULL;
- Result: 0
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS empty_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND trim(family) = '';
- Result: 0
- SQL: SELECT count(*) AS unassigned_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NOT NULL AND lower(trim(family)) = 'unassigned';
- Result: 1

Assessment
- The data shows 23 viral_disease records. All 23 have a non-empty value in the family column; 22 are assigned to specific named families, and 1 record’s family value is literally 'unassigned'.
- Therefore, the claim that only 1 viral disease has been assigned to a family is contradicted by the data. In reality, 22 have assigned families, and only 1 is marked unassigned.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “assigned to a family” as having a specific family name: non-null, non-empty, and not equal to the literal 'unassigned' (case-insensitive).
