Summary
- I investigated the available authoritative dataset: TabFact (public schema), which contains one relevant table: t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league. This table lists fixtures from the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League with columns: "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg".
- I searched for any fixture where Standard Liège (including name variants) appears as "team 1" and Hamburg (including name variants) appears as "team 2".
- No such row exists in this dataset. While Standard Liège and Hamburg each appear in the table, they do not face each other with Standard Liège as team 1.

Executed evidence (SQL and results)
1) Row count (table accessibility check)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league;
Result: [{"count":8}]

2) Preview table contents (to observe exact team name spellings)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league LIMIT 50;
Result:
[
 {"1st leg":"3 - 1","2nd leg":"3 - 4","agg":"6 - 5","team 1":"hamburg","team 2":"anderlecht"},
 {"1st leg":"1 - 1","2nd leg":"1 - 2 ( aet )","agg":"2 - 3","team 1":"rubin kazan","team 2":"wolfsburg"},
 {"1st leg":"0 - 0","2nd leg":"2 - 2","agg":"2 - 2 ( a )","team 1":"atlético madrid","team 2":"sporting cp"},
 {"1st leg":"1 - 1","2nd leg":"2 - 1","agg":"3 - 2","team 1":"benfica","team 2":"marseille"},
 {"1st leg":"1 - 3","2nd leg":"0 - 1","agg":"1 - 4","team 1":"panathinaikos","team 2":"standard liège"},
 {"1st leg":"1 - 0","2nd leg":"0 - 3","agg":"1 - 3","team 1":"lille","team 2":"liverpool"},
 {"1st leg":"3 - 1","2nd leg":"1 - 4","agg":"4 - 5","team 1":"juventus","team 2":"fulham"},
 {"1st leg":"1 - 1","2nd leg":"4 - 4","agg":"5 - 5 ( a )","team 1":"valencia","team 2":"werder bremen"}
]

3) Find all rows mentioning Standard Liège (variants) on either side
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%standard%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%standard%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%liege%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%liege%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%liège%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%liège%';
Result:
[{"1st leg":"1 - 3","2nd leg":"0 - 1","agg":"1 - 4","team 1":"panathinaikos","team 2":"standard liège"}]

4) Find all rows mentioning Hamburg (variants) on either side
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%hamburg%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%hamburg%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%hamburger%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%hamburger%';
Result:
[{"1st leg":"3 - 1","2nd leg":"3 - 4","agg":"6 - 5","team 1":"hamburg","team 2":"anderlecht"}]

5) Direct test: team 1 is Standard (variants) AND team 2 is Hamburg (variants)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE ("team 1" ILIKE '%standard%' OR "team 1" ILIKE '%liege%' OR "team 1" ILIKE '%liège%')
  AND ("team 2" ILIKE '%hamburg%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%hamburger%');
Result: [{"count":0}]

Conclusion
- In this dataset, there is no match where Standard Liège is listed as team 1 against Hamburg. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (2009–10 UEFA Europa League fixtures in table t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league). Within this scope, I treated name variants case-insensitively: Standard/Standard Liège/Liege/Liège and Hamburg/Hamburger SV.
