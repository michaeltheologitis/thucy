Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with a public schema. Relevant table found: t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team, which contains game-by-game schedule entries including opponents and scores.

What I checked:
- Searched the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season table for any game against Virginia Tech and examined the recorded score.

Evidence:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, team, score FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE team ILIKE '%Virginia Tech%';

- Result:
  date: "november 27"
  team: "virginia tech"
  score: "w 61 - 50"

Interpretation:
- The score field "w 61 - 50" indicates Temple won the game with a final score of 61–50 over Virginia Tech. This directly matches the claim that the final score was 61–50 when the Temple Owls beat Virginia Tech.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data available in the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season table.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to men’s basketball and to the game recorded in the 2009–10 season table. The leading "w" in the score denotes a Temple win.
