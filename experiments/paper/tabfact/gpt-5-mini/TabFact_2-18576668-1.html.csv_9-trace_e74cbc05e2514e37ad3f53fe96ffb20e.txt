Claim to verify: "there be 10 event in 2011"

How I interpreted the claim
- I interpret "event" as a row in the available events-like table, and "in 2011" as rows whose date (or season) indicates the year 2011.

Data sources discovered
- One accessible database: TabFact (public schema).

Relevant schema (queried)
- Table: public.tsuyoshi_fujita
  - Columns: season (text), "event type" (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)
  - No primary key defined.

Exploration of data
- Sample rows to understand date format:
  SQL executed:
  SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank
  FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
  LIMIT 20;
  Observation: The date column stores human-readable strings like "10 - 12 june 2011"; seasons can be a year range (e.g., "2000 - 01") or a single year (e.g., "2005").

Evidence queries
1) Count of rows with a date in 2011
   - SQL executed:
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2011 FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date ~ '2011';
   - Result: count_2011 = 1

   - Matched row(s) (for transparency):
     SQL executed:
     SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date ~ '2011';
     Result:
     { season: "2011", event type: "pro tour", location: "nagoya", format: "block constructed and booster draft", date: "10 - 12 june 2011", rank: 5 }

2) Cross-check using the season column for 2011 occurrences
   - SQL executed:
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2011_rows FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season LIKE '%2011%';
   - Result: count_2011_rows = 1

   - Listing those rows:
     SQL executed:
     SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season LIKE '%2011%';
     Result:
     { season: "2011", event type: "pro tour", location: "nagoya", format: "block constructed and booster draft", date: "10 - 12 june 2011", rank: 5 }

3) Total rows in the table (context)
   - SQL executed:
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita;
   - Result: total_rows = 21

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 1 event in 2011, not 10. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- "Event" refers to rows in the public.tsuyoshi_fujita table.
- Year identification relies on the presence of the four-digit substring "2011" in the text-based date or season fields, consistent with observed formatting in the table.
