Scope and data sources
- Discovered data asset: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (postgres_tabfact7), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (no PK). Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).

Understanding the attendance field
- The attendance information is embedded in the text column "location attendance" as: "<arena name> <attendance_number>", e.g., "time warner cable arena 19164".

Verification steps and evidence
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm format
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE "location attendance" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY game LIMIT 50;
Key returned rows (truncated):
- {game:47, date:"february 1", team:"portland", location attendance:"rose garden 20106"}
- {game:48, date:"february 3", team:"la lakers", location attendance:"staples center 18997"}
- {game:49, date:"february 6", team:"new orleans", location attendance:"time warner cable arena 19164"}
- {game:50, date:"february 9", team:"washington", location attendance:"time warner cable arena 12376"}

2) Compute the minimum numeric attendance by extracting digits and casting to integer
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN((regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'))::integer) AS min_att
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE "location attendance" ~ '[0-9]';
Result: {min_att: 12376}

3) List the game(s) at that minimum
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE (regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','', 'g'))::integer = 12376
ORDER BY game;
Result:
- {game:50, date:"february 9", team:"washington", location attendance:"time warner cable arena 12376"}

Conclusion
- The lowest attendance figure for a game in this dataset is 12,376.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the “attendance for a game” within the table public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (Charlotte Bobcats 2009–10 season) and uses the numeric value embedded in the "location attendance" field as the attendance count.
- Attendance is the integer formed by removing non-digits from the "location attendance" text, which consistently places the attendance as the trailing number.
