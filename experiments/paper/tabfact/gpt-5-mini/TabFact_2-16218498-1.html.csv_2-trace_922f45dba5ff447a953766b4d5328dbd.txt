Scope and data sources explored
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact), schema public, with one relevant table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- Table columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Establish table size and inspect formatting of 1st-leg scores
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;
Result: total_rows = 10

- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "1st leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs ORDER BY "1st leg" NULLS FIRST;
Distinct values observed:
- 0 - 0
- 1 - 0
- 1 - 1
- 1 - 3
- 2 - 1
- 2 - 3
- 3 - 0

2) Count ties where the 1st leg score is 0-0 (allowing common separators and spaces)
- SQL executed (regex accepts hyphen/en dash/em dash/colon separators with optional spaces and anchors to full string):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_zero_first_leg FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "1st leg" ~ '^[[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*[-–—:][[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*$';
Result: zero_zero_first_leg = 2

3) List the matching ties for transparency
- SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1","team 2","1st leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "1st leg" ~ '^[[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*[-–—:][[:space:]]*0[[:space:]]*$' ORDER BY "team 1","team 2";
Rows returned:
- team 1: port autonome, team 2: sporting clube da praia, 1st leg: 0 - 0
- team 1: tourbillon fc, team 2: forces armées ca, 1st leg: 0 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 2 ties with a first-leg score of 0-0 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs) and treats each row as a tie with a recorded first-leg score.
- Formatting variants for 0-0 were considered via regex; the actual values present were precisely "0 - 0".
