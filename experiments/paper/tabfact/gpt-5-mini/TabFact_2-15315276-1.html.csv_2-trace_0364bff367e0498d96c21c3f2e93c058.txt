Claim to verify: “after 2012 the winner's share be never less than 15000.”

Data source overview
- Connected database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.northeast_delta_dental_international
- Columns include: year (bigint), purse (bigint), and a prize column exactly named “winner 's share” (bigint)

Step 1: Confirm available years and coverage after 2012
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international ORDER BY year;
  Result: 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year, MAX(year) AS max_year FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international;
  Result: min_year = 2004, max_year = 2013
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_after_2012 FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012;
  Result: rows_after_2012 = 1
Interpretation: The table has data through 2013, with exactly one row strictly after 2012.

Step 2: Check winner's share strictly after 2012 (year > 2012)
- SQL:
  SELECT year, "winner 's share" FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012 ORDER BY year;
  Result: (2013, 15000)
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN("winner 's share") AS min_winner_share FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012;
  Result: min_winner_share = 15000
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_under_15000 FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012 AND "winner 's share" < 15000;
  Result: count_under_15000 = 0
Interpretation: For the only year after 2012 (2013), the winner’s share equals 15000, and there are no values below 15000.

Step 3 (robustness): Also check 2012-and-later (≥ 2012), in case “after 2012” was intended inclusively
- SQL:
  SELECT year, "winner 's share" FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year = 2012;
  Result: (2012, 15000)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_below_15000 FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year >= 2012 AND "winner 's share" < 15000;
  Result: count_below_15000 = 0
Interpretation: Even including 2012, there are no rows with winner’s share below 15000.

Conclusion
- Based on the dataset, for years strictly after 2012, the winner’s share is never less than 15000 (it is exactly 15000 in 2013). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “after 2012” as years > 2012; I also checked ≥ 2012 to cover an inclusive interpretation, with the same conclusion.
- Relied on the table public.northeast_delta_dental_international and its column exactly named “winner 's share.”
