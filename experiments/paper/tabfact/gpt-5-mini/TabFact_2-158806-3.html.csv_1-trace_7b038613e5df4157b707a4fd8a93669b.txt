Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. The table entry for the 1 ₧ (Spanish peseta) coin lists a diameter of 14 mm and a weight of 0.55 g.

Evidence from database queries:

1) Verify the table structure used
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, ordinal_position
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'peseta'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

Result (abridged):
- value: text
- equiv: text
- diameter: text
- weight: text
- composition: text

2) Retrieve the 1 ₧ coin specifications
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM peseta WHERE value = '1 peseta' OR value = '1 ₧';

Result:
- value: 1 ₧
- equiv: 0.006 (0.01)
- diameter: 14 mm
- weight: 0.55 g
- composition: aluminium

Assessment: The data row for value = '1 ₧' explicitly reports diameter = 14 mm and weight = 0.55 g, matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “the value of 1 ₧” as the 1 peseta coin entry present in the available dataset. Historical 1 peseta coins have varied over time; this verification pertains to the specification captured in the referenced table entry.
