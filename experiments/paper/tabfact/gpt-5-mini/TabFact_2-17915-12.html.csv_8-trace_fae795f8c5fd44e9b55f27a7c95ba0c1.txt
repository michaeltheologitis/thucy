What I checked
- I searched the available data sources and found one database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.lleyton_hewitt, containing records of Lleyton Hewitt’s finals with outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, and score.

Step 1: Inspect all available rows to understand context
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;

Result (7 rows):
1) 2000 | stuttgart | hard (i) | wayne ferreira | outcome: runner - up | score: 6 - 7 (6 - 8) , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5) , 6 - 7 (2 - 7) , 2 - 6
2) 2002 | indian wells | hard | tim henman | outcome: winner | score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 2
3) 2002 | cincinnati | hard | carlos moyá | outcome: runner - up | score: 5 - 7 , 6 - 7 (5 - 7)
4) 2002 | paris | carpet (i) | marat safin | outcome: runner - up | score: 6 - 7 (4 - 7) , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6
5) 2003 | indian wells (2) | hard | gustavo kuerten | outcome: winner | score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 1
6) 2004 | cincinnati (2) | hard | andre agassi | outcome: runner - up | score: 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 2 - 6
7) 2005 | indian wells | hard | roger federer | outcome: runner - up | score: 2 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6

Observation: The table contains 7 finals (likely ATP Masters events) with outcomes explicitly labeled as “winner” or “runner - up”.

Step 2: Count total entries and runner-up outcomes
Executed SQL (total rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM lleyton_hewitt;
Result: total_rows = 7

Executed SQL (outcomes breakdown):
SELECT LOWER(outcome) AS outcome_norm, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM lleyton_hewitt GROUP BY outcome_norm ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Results:
- runner - up: 5
- winner: 2

Conclusion
- The data show Lleyton Hewitt was runner-up 5 times out of a total of 7 finals recorded in this table, not 1 time out of 7. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions noted
- “ileyton hewitt” is interpreted as “Lleyton Hewitt”, the Australian tennis player.
- The available table appears to cover his ATP Masters-level finals (based on championship names like Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris, Stuttgart). With only this authoritative data source available, I evaluate the claim against these 7 recorded finals.
