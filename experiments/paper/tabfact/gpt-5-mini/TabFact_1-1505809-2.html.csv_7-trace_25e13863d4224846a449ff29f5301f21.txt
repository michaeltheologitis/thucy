Overview of data sources explored:
- Discovered one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with two tables in the public schema: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier and bhind_lok_sabha_constituency. The relevant table for this claim is t_2005_tim_hortons_brier.

Relevant schema details (t_2005_tim_hortons_brier):
- Columns: locale (text), skip (text), w (bigint), l (bigint), pf (bigint), pa (bigint), ends won (bigint), ends lost (bigint), blank ends (bigint), stolen ends (bigint), shot pct (text).

Claim interpreted:
- The claim suggests that “46 be the value of blank end when stolen end be 7,” i.e., for the row(s) where stolen ends = 7, blank ends = 46.

Evidence 1 — Direct check of rows with stolen ends = 7:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "locale", "skip", "blank ends", "stolen ends" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "stolen ends" = 7;
- Result:
  - locale: ontario, skip: wayne middaugh, blank ends: 10, stolen ends: 7
- Finding: For stolen ends = 7, blank ends = 10 (not 46).

Evidence 2 — Distribution of blank ends across all rows (to see typical values and maxima):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "skip", locale, "blank ends", "stolen ends" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier ORDER BY "blank ends" DESC;
- Result excerpt (sorted by blank ends desc):
  1) deane horning (british columbia): blank ends 18, stolen ends 12
  2) wade blanchard (new brunswick): blank ends 17, stolen ends 8
  3) shawn adams (nova scotia): blank ends 16, stolen ends 13
  4) brad gushue (newfoundland and labrador): blank ends 13, stolen ends 10
  5) pat simmons (saskatchewan): blank ends 12, stolen ends 9
  6) rod macdonald (prince edward island): blank ends 12, stolen ends 5
  7) wayne middaugh (ontario): blank ends 10, stolen ends 7
  8) randy dutiaume (manitoba): blank ends 10, stolen ends 13
  9) mike jakubo (northern ontario): blank ends 9, stolen ends 6
  10) jean - michel mãnard (quebec): blank ends 8, stolen ends 15
  11) randy ferbey (alberta): blank ends 7, stolen ends 9
- Finding: The maximum blank ends observed is 18, far below 46.

Evidence 3 — Explicit check for any row with blank ends = 46:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 46;
- Result: count = 0
- Finding: No row has blank ends equal to 46.

Conclusion:
- The data directly contradicts the claim. When stolen ends = 7 (Wayne Middaugh, Ontario), blank ends = 10. Additionally, there is no instance in the table where blank ends equals 46; the maximum blank ends among all rows is 18.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the phrase “blank end” as the column "blank ends" and “stolen end” as the column "stolen ends" in the t_2005_tim_hortons_brier table.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to this table’s per-team statistics for the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier event.
