Claim to verify: "the at90s1200 chip have a frequency of 12 mhz"

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: One accessible PostgreSQL instance with a public schema containing a table likely relevant to microcontroller specs.

Step 2: Inspect schema to ground the analysis
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Summary: Database TabFact, schema public, table my_info_table with columns: chip (text), flash size (text), eeprom (bigint), sram (bigint), frequency (bigint), package (text). This table is appropriate for verifying chip frequency values.

Step 3: Retrieve the frequency for AT90S1200
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT chip, frequency FROM public.my_info_table WHERE chip ILIKE 'AT90S1200' ORDER BY frequency NULLS LAST;
- Result:
  chip = 'at90s1200', frequency = 12

Step 4: Check for other entries related to the 1200 family (to ensure no conflicting entries)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT chip, frequency FROM public.my_info_table WHERE chip ILIKE '%1200%';
- Result:
  at90s1200 | 12

Step 5: Infer units by sampling other chips’ frequency values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT chip, frequency FROM public.my_info_table WHERE chip IS NOT NULL AND frequency IS NOT NULL LIMIT 10;
- Results (chip — frequency):
  1) at90s1200 — 12
  2) at90s2313 — 10
  3) at90s / ls2323 — 10
  4) at90s / ls2343 — 10
  5) at90s4414 — 8
  6) at90s / ls4434 — 8
  7) at90s8515 — 8
  8) at90s / ls8535 — 8
- Interpretation: Frequencies for AVR parts commonly appear as small integers (8, 10, 12), consistent with megahertz units in typical datasheets, supporting the interpretation that the frequency column is in MHz.

Conclusion
- The database reports frequency = 12 for chip at90s1200. Sampling other AVR entries supports the unit being MHz. Therefore, the claim that "the at90s1200 chip have a frequency of 12 mhz" is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The frequency column is in MHz (supported by comparative entries).
- "Frequency" refers to the device’s rated maximum clock frequency/speed grade for the listed chip variant.
