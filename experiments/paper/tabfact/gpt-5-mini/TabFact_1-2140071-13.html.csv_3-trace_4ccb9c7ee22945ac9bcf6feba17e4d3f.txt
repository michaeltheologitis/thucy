Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single relevant table (made_tv_series) containing MTV Made episode details.
- Queried for episodes where the coach is Rebecca Star and examined the episode summary.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: made_tv_series.

Schema details
- Table: made_tv_series
  - season (bigint)
  - episode (bigint)
  - episode summary (text)
  - premier date (text)
  - external link (text)
  - coach (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify coach values matching Rebecca Star
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT coach FROM made_tv_series WHERE coach ILIKE '%rebe%' OR coach ILIKE '%star%' OR coach ILIKE '%starr%' ORDER BY coach;
Result:
[{"coach":"rebecca star"}]

2) Retrieve the episode details for coach = Rebecca Star
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM made_tv_series WHERE coach ILIKE '%rebecca star%' ORDER BY season, episode;
Result:
[{"season":13,"episode":13,"premier date":"october 15 , 2012","coach":"rebecca star","episode summary":"ashley is made into a circus performer"}]

Assessment
- The episode summary explicitly states: "ashley is made into a circus performer" for the episode with coach "rebecca star". This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Coach name matching was performed case-insensitively and allowed partial matches to capture minor spelling/case variations.
- The made_tv_series table is authoritative for MTV Made episode details in this context.
