Summary
- Claim: "the collingwood v melbourne game have the third largest crowd size"
- Finding: In the available dataset (public.t_1972_vfl_season), the Collingwood vs Melbourne match has the largest (rank 1) crowd, not the third largest.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data sources: PostgreSQL database TabFact (postgres_tabfact7)
- Relevant table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Rank all matches by crowd descending
SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT rank() OVER (ORDER BY crowd DESC) AS rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
FROM ranked
ORDER BY rank, crowd DESC;
Result (abridged to key facts):
- Rank 1: crowd 30883 — 15 july 1972, vfl park — home: collingwood, away: melbourne
- Rank 2: crowd 22251 — essendon vs richmond (windy hill)
- Rank 3: crowd 18655 — footscray vs st kilda (western oval)
- Remaining ranks show smaller crowds

2) Identify Collingwood vs Melbourne matchup(s) and their rank
SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT rank() OVER (ORDER BY crowd DESC) AS rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
FROM ranked
WHERE (lower("home team") = 'collingwood' AND lower("away team") = 'melbourne')
   OR (lower("home team") = 'melbourne' AND lower("away team") = 'collingwood')
ORDER BY rank;
Result:
- Rank 1: crowd 30883 — 15 july 1972, vfl park — home: collingwood, away: melbourne

3) Retrieve the match with the 3rd largest crowd
SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT rank() OVER (ORDER BY crowd DESC) AS rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT rank, crowd, date, venue, "home team", "away team"
FROM ranked
WHERE rank = 3;
Result:
- Rank 3: crowd 18655 — 15 july 1972, western oval — home: footscray, away: st kilda

Conclusion
- The Collingwood vs Melbourne game in this dataset is ranked 1st by crowd (30,883), not 3rd. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated against the available authoritative dataset (public.t_1972_vfl_season). The table appears to capture a specific set of 1972 VFL matches (all dated 15 July 1972). No broader season-wide or multi-season data was available through the tools, so conclusions are scoped to this dataset.
