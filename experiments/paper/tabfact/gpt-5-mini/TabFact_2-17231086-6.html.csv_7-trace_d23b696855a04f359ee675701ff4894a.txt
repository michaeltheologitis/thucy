Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and identified a single accessible table relevant to player scores.
- Verified the schema to locate fields for country and score.
- Retrieved entries for Japan and computed the average total score by parsing the score string.

Data source discovery
- Source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf (place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text, money bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify country values and counts
SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf GROUP BY country ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
[{"cnt":9,"country":"united states"},{"cnt":1,"country":"japan"},{"cnt":1,"country":"spain"},{"cnt":1,"country":"wales"}]

2) Inspect the Japan row and score format
SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(country)='japan';
Result:
[{"place":"t6","player":"masashi ozaki","country":"japan","score":"70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281","to par":"+ 1","money":28220}]

3) Compute average total score for Japan by extracting the number after '=' in score
SQL:
SELECT AVG(val)::numeric AS average_total_score FROM (
  SELECT (regexp_replace(split_part(score,'=',2),'[^0-9.-]','','g'))::numeric AS val
  FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE lower(country)='japan' AND score LIKE '%=%' AND regexp_replace(split_part(score,'=',2),'[^0-9.-]','', 'g') <> ''
) AS sub;
Result:
[{"average_total_score":281.0000000000000000}]

Conclusion
- The average score for the player from Japan in this dataset is 281.0, not 251.

Assumptions
- "Player from japan" refers to rows where country equals "japan" in t_1989_u_s_open_golf.
- "Score" refers to the tournament total strokes, represented as the numeric value after '=' in the score field.
- Only one Japanese player is present in this table; thus the average equals that single total.
