Claim to verify: “lake oval venue record a higher crowd participation than that of the glenferrie oval venue.”

Data source discovered:
- PostgreSQL database (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1961_vfl_season with columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Step 1: Understand venue coverage in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE venue IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY venue;

Result:
- arden street oval: 1
- glenferrie oval: 1
- kardinia park: 1
- lake oval: 1
- mcg: 1
- victoria park: 1

Interpretation: Each of the two venues in question appears once in this dataset.

Step 2: Retrieve crowd (attendance) at Lake Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT "date","home team","away team","venue","crowd"
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE venue ILIKE '%lake oval%'
ORDER BY "date";

Result:
- date: 3 june 1961; home team: south melbourne; away team: fitzroy; venue: lake oval; crowd: 14500

Step 3: Retrieve crowd (attendance) at Glenferrie Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT "date","home team","away team","venue","crowd"
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE venue ILIKE '%glenferrie oval%'
ORDER BY "date";

Result:
- date: 3 june 1961; home team: hawthorn; away team: richmond; venue: glenferrie oval; crowd: 15000

Comparison and conclusion:
- Lake Oval crowd: 14,500
- Glenferrie Oval crowd: 15,000
- 14,500 < 15,000, therefore Lake Oval did not record a higher crowd participation than Glenferrie Oval in this dataset.

Final assessment: The claim is contradicted by the data from public.t_1961_vfl_season.

Assumptions made:
- “Crowd participation” is interpreted as the attendance column “crowd”.
- Comparison is based on the available records in this dataset (one match per venue as returned by Step 1), not on external seasons or additional matches.
- Venue matching used case-insensitive substring matching (ILIKE) to capture the named venues exactly as stored.
