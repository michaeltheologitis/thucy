Claim to verify: “Olga Govortsova reach the final in a Grand Slam tournament.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single relational data source: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema) containing table: public.olga_govortsova.
- Schema inspection shows columns: tournament, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 (all text). This table summarizes Olga Govortsova’s singles results by tournament for 2007–2011.

Evidence retrieved (executed SQL and results)
1) Retrieve the full table to review Grand Slam results
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;
Key rows returned (tournament | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011):
- australian open | a | 1r | 1r | 1r | 1r
- french open     | a | 3r | 3r | 2r | 2r
- wimbledon       | 2r | 1r | 2r | 1r | 1r
- us open         | 2r | 2r | 1r | 1r | 1r
(Other rows include non-Slam events and summary lines; none indicate a final.)

2) Explicitly search for any final-stage indicators in any year cells
SQL:
SELECT tournament, '2007' AS year, "2007" AS result
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(trim("2007")) IN ('f','final','runner-up','sf')
UNION ALL
SELECT tournament, '2008' AS year, "2008" AS result
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(trim("2008")) IN ('f','final','runner-up','sf')
UNION ALL
SELECT tournament, '2009' AS year, "2009" AS result
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(trim("2009")) IN ('f','final','runner-up','sf')
UNION ALL
SELECT tournament, '2010' AS year, "2010" AS result
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(trim("2010")) IN ('f','final','runner-up','sf')
UNION ALL
SELECT tournament, '2011' AS year, "2011" AS result
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(trim("2011")) IN ('f','final','runner-up','sf')
ORDER BY tournament, year;
Result: No rows matched (no tournament/year entries with those final-stage values).

Assessment
- Within the available dataset (singles results for 2007–2011), Olga Govortsova did not reach a Grand Slam final. Her best Grand Slam singles results shown are third round (French Open 2008 and 2009). There is no evidence in this data of a final (or even a semifinal) appearance at a Grand Slam.

Conclusion
- The claim that Olga Govortsova reached the final in a Grand Slam tournament is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The table appears to cover singles results only and spans 2007–2011. It does not include doubles/mixed results or years outside this range. The conclusion is therefore based strictly on the observable singles data from 2007–2011 in the provided source.
