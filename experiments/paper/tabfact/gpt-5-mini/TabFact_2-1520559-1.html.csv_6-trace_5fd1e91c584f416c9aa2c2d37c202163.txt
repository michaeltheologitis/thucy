Claim to verify: "karrie webb be the runner up in 2008 and become the champion in 2010 and 2011"

Data sources explored:
- TabFact PostgreSQL, public schema, table: women_s_british_open (records of the Women’s British Open: year, champion, runner(s)-up, etc.)

Evidence 1 — Who won and who was runner-up in 2008, 2010, 2011:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2008, 2010, 2011) ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2008 — Champion: jiyai shin; Runner-up: yani tseng
- 2010 — Champion: yani tseng; Runner-up: katherine hull
- 2011 — Champion: yani tseng; Runner-up: brittany lang

Evidence 2 — Any years Karrie Webb was champion or runner-up at this event:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE champion ILIKE '%Karrie Webb%' OR "runner (s) - up" ILIKE '%Karrie Webb%' ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2002 — champion: karrie webb
- 2009 — runner(s)-up: karrie webb

Assessment:
- The data shows Karrie Webb was not the runner-up in 2008 (it was Yani Tseng) and was not the champion in 2010 or 2011 (Yani Tseng won both years). Karrie Webb does appear as champion in 2002 and runner-up in 2009.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available data for the Women’s British Open.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Women’s British Open because the only available authoritative dataset is the women_s_british_open table. Other tournaments are outside the scope of the accessible data and were not used to assess the claim.
