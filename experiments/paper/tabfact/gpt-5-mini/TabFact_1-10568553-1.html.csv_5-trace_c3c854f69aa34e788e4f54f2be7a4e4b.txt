Claim to verify: "plymouth county have 2 location , rockland and stroughton"

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL (TabFact) instance with one table: public.massachusetts_route_139. Relevant columns: county (text), location (text).

What the data shows:
1) Which counties exist in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT county FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 ORDER BY county;
- Result: norfolk; plymouth

2) Which locations are labeled under Plymouth county
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT location FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE county ILIKE 'plymouth' ORDER BY location;
- Result: hanover; rockland

3) How many distinct locations are labeled under Plymouth county
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location) AS distinct_plymouth_locations FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE county ILIKE 'plymouth';
- Result: 2

4) Which locations are labeled under Norfolk county (to check Stoughton)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT location FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE lower(county) = 'norfolk' ORDER BY location;
- Result: stoughton; weymouth

5) Does the dataset ever label Stoughton as being in Plymouth county?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE lower(coalesce(county,'')) = 'plymouth' AND lower(coalesce(location,'')) = 'stoughton';
- Result: 0

Assessment:
- Within this dataset, Plymouth county has exactly 2 locations associated with it: hanover and rockland.
- Stoughton appears under Norfolk county, not Plymouth county, and there are 0 records of Stoughton being in Plymouth county.

Conclusion: The claim is mostly incorrect. While Plymouth county does have two locations in this dataset, they are Hanover and Rockland—not Rockland and Stoughton.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- Interpreted "stroughton" as a misspelling of "stoughton".
- Interpreted "have 2 location" within the scope of this dataset (public.massachusetts_route_139), which catalogs Route 139-related entries with county and location fields. It does not enumerate all municipalities in Plymouth County generally; conclusions are limited to what this dataset records.
