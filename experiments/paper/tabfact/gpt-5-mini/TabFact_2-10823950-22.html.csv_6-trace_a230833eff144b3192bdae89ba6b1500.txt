Claim to verify: “when the away team score 15.17 (107) the home team be north melbourne.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows that when the away team scored 15.17 (107), the away team was North Melbourne and the home team was South Melbourne. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

Evidence from data (TabFact.public.t_1981_vfl_season):

1) Exact match on away-team score text
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season WHERE "away team score" = '15.17 (107)';
Result:
- home team: south melbourne; away team: north melbourne; away team score: 15.17 (107); date: 29 august 1981; venue: lake oval

2) Robust search using regex to catch formatting variations for goals.behinds
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team","away team","away team score","date","venue" FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season WHERE "away team score" ~ '15[^0-9]+17';
Result:
- home team: south melbourne; away team: north melbourne; away team score: 15.17 (107); date: 29 august 1981; venue: lake oval

3) Search by total points text (107)
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team","away team","away team score","date","venue" FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season WHERE "away team score" LIKE '%107%';
Result:
- home team: south melbourne; away team: north melbourne; away team score: 15.17 (107); date: 29 august 1981; venue: lake oval

Assessment:
- The only match in the available dataset with away team score 15.17 (107) has North Melbourne as the away team and South Melbourne as the home team. Thus, the statement that “the home team be north melbourne” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the matches contained in the available dataset TabFact.public.t_1981_vfl_season (1981 VFL season), where scores are stored as text in the format goals.behinds (total points).
- I treated “15.17 (107)” as a literal away-team score string and also searched for minor formatting variations and by total points to ensure coverage.
