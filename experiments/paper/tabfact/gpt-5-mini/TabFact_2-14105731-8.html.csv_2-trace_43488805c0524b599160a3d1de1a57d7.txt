Claim to verify: “223 be the only episode number with q147 format.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table (episode bigint, season bigint, format text, title text, original airdate text)

Evidence 1 — Which episodes have format code q147 (case-insensitive, trimmed):
- Result: Only episode 225 matches; total distinct episodes = 1.
- Executed SQL (listing distinct episodes):
  SELECT DISTINCT episode FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(format)) = 'q147' ORDER BY episode;
- Returned rows:
  episode
  225
- Executed SQL (counting distinct episodes):
  SELECT count(DISTINCT episode) AS distinct_episode_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(format)) = 'q147';
- Returned:
  distinct_episode_count
  1

Evidence 2 — Is episode 223 among episodes with q147?
- Result: No (false).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(format)) = 'q147' AND episode = 223) AS episode_223_present;
- Returned:
  episode_223_present
  false

Evidence 3 — What format(s) does episode 223 have?
- Result: Episode 223 has format q146.
- Executed SQL (list episode 223 rows):
  SELECT episode, season, format, title FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episode = 223 ORDER BY season NULLS LAST, title NULLS LAST;
- Returned:
  {episode: 223, season: 7, format: "q146", title: "grandpa 's nemesis / grandpa 's walking stick"}
- Executed SQL (distinct formats for episode 223):
  SELECT DISTINCT format FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episode = 223;
- Returned:
  {format: "q146"}

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows that the only episode with format q147 is episode 225, not 223. Episode 223 is associated with format q146. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “q147 format” was interpreted as the value q147 in the format column, matched case-insensitively with whitespace trimmed via lower(trim(format)) = 'q147'.
- “Episode number” refers to the episode column in public.my_info_table.
