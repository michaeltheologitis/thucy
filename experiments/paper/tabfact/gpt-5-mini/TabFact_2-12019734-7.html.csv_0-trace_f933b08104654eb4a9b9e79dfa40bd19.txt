Claim interpreted: The user asserts that New Jersey was the home team in the game on February 3 (year unspecified).

Data sources explored:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema). Relevant table discovered with sports game structure: my_info_table(date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Direct check for February 3
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM public.my_info_table WHERE date ILIKE '%February 3%';
- Result:
  - date: february 3, visitor: ny islanders, home: new jersey, score: 7 - 2
- Interpretation: On February 3, the home team in the listed game is “new jersey,” confirming the claim.

2) Context (sample of table contents)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 20;
- Sample rows include (first row):
  - date: february 3, visitor: ny islanders, home: new jersey, score: 7 - 2, record: 11 - 32 - 11
- This aligns with the direct check above.

Conclusion: The table shows that on February 3, New Jersey was the home team (vs. NY Islanders).

Assumptions:
- The date field is stored as text; case-insensitive matching was used to locate “February 3.”
- “New Jersey” refers to the team name in the home column of this table; specific year is not provided in the dataset.
- The single row for that date represents the relevant game in question.
