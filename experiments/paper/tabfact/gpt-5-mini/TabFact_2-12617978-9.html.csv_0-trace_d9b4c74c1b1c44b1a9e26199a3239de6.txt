Claim interpreted: Both “Beach Break Live” and “Concentrate Design” were invested in by Peter Jones and each requested more than 35,000.

Findings grounded in data
- Beach Break Live
  - Evidence: The database shows a row for “beach break live” with investing dragon(s) = “peter jones” and money requested = 50000 (> 35000).
  - Executed SQL and result:
    SELECT "episode", "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested", "investing dragon (s)" FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE "company or product name" ILIKE '%beach%' AND "company or product name" ILIKE '%break%';
    → Result row: { episode: "episode 1", company or product name: "beach break live", entrepreneur (s): "celia norowzian & ian forshew", money requested: 50000, investing dragon (s): "peter jones" }

- Concentrate Design
  - Evidence: The database shows a row for “concentrate design” with investing dragon(s) = “peter jones” and money requested = 100000 (> 35000).
  - Executed SQL and result:
    SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested", "investing dragon (s)"
    FROM public.dragons_den_uk
    WHERE "company or product name" ILIKE '%concentrate design%';
    → Result row: { episode: "episode 3", company or product name: "concentrate design", entrepreneur (s): "mark champkins", money requested: 100000, investing dragon (s): "peter jones" }

- Consolidated verification (both companies at once)
  - Executed SQL and result:
    SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested", "investing dragon (s)" 
    FROM public.dragons_den_uk
    WHERE LOWER("company or product name") IN ('beach break live','concentrate design');
    → Results:
      1) { company or product name: "beach break live", episode: "episode 1", entrepreneur (s): "celia norowzian & ian forshew", money requested: 50000, investing dragon (s): "peter jones" }
      2) { company or product name: "concentrate design", episode: "episode 3", entrepreneur (s): "mark champkins", money requested: 100000, investing dragon (s): "peter jones" }

Conclusion
- Both companies were invested in by Peter Jones, and both requested more than 35,000. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “cone timentrate design” as “Concentrate Design.”
- Interpreted “be invest in by Peter Jones” to mean Peter Jones appears in the investing dragon(s) field.
- Interpreted “with more than 35000 request” as the money requested amount being greater than 35,000.
