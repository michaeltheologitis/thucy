Claim: “the 1977, 1978 and 1989 season each have less than 26 point, more than 18 game, and exactly 13 loss.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact20
- Table: public.coquitlam_adanacs (columns: season TEXT, "team name" TEXT, games BIGINT, losses BIGINT, points BIGINT)

Step 1 — Inspect seasons and values
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, games, losses, points
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
ORDER BY season;

Key results relevant to the claim:
- 1977 — games: 24, losses: 13, points: 22
- 1978 — games: 24, losses: 13, points: 21
- 1989 — games: 24, losses: 13, points: 22

Step 2 — Direct verification for 1977, 1978, 1989
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, games, losses, points, (points < 26) AS points_lt_26, (games > 18) AS games_gt_18, (losses = 13) AS losses_eq_13
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989')
ORDER BY season;

Results:
- 1977 | games: 24 | losses: 13 | points: 22 | points_lt_26: true | games_gt_18: true | losses_eq_13: true
- 1978 | games: 24 | losses: 13 | points: 21 | points_lt_26: true | games_gt_18: true | losses_eq_13: true
- 1989 | games: 24 | losses: 13 | points: 22 | points_lt_26: true | games_gt_18: true | losses_eq_13: true

Conclusion
- All three specified seasons meet all three conditions. The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Season” refers to the season field in the public.coquitlam_adanacs table for the Coquitlam Adanacs team. The aggregate row labeled “total” is not a season and was excluded from verification.
