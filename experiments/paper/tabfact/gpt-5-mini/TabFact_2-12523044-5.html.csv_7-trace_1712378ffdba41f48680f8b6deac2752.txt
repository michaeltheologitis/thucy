Summary
- Claim interpreted: In the available 2006 U.S. Open golf dataset, Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy (of Australia) were the only players recorded at +1 to par.
- Finding: Supported by the data. Exactly two rows exist with to par = "+ 1", for Kenneth Ferrie (England) and Geoff Ogilvy (Australia).

Data source and schema context
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve all players at +1 to par
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" = '+ 1';
Result rows:
- player: kenneth ferrie, country: england, place: t3, score: 71 + 70 = 141, to par: + 1
- player: geoff ogilvy, country: australia, place: t3, score: 71 + 70 = 141, to par: + 1

2) Count how many players are at +1 to par
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_plus_one FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" = '+ 1';
Result:
- count_plus_one: 2

3) Verify formatting of the "to par" values (to ensure correct matching)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT("to par") AS to_par_value FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY to_par_value;
Result (distinct values): - 1, + 1, + 2, + 3, e

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly two players at +1 to par: Kenneth Ferrie (England) and Geoff Ogilvy (Australia). Therefore, the claim that these two were the only players to score +1 to par is supported by the data available.

Assumptions
- The table represents a specific leaderboard snapshot for the 2006 U.S. Open (the score format “71 + 70 = 141” suggests a cumulative multi-round tally, likely after two rounds). The verification is grounded strictly in this dataset’s contents.
- The phrase “geoff ogilvy of australia” is interpreted as specifying Ogilvy’s nationality only, not implying the same for Ferrie.
