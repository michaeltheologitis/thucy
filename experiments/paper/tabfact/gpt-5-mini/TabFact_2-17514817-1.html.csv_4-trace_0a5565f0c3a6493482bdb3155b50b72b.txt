Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Maggs Magnificent Mild won an award at the SIBA National Beer Competition two times between 1995 and 2009.”

Data discovery and schema context
- Data sources discovered: One PostgreSQL source (postgres_tabfact23), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.west_berkshire_brewery with columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text).

Step 1 — Confirm how SIBA competitions are recorded
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT competition FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery ORDER BY competition;
Result (excerpt):
- siba national beer competition
- siba south east region beer competition
(Establishes the exact naming used for the national competition.)

Step 2 — Locate all entries for Maggs Magnificent Mild and identify SIBA National results
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE LOWER("beer name") LIKE '%magg%' ORDER BY year, "beer name";
Key results for the SIBA National Beer Competition:
- 2003 | maggs magnificent mild | gold medal | mild and porter | siba national beer competition
- 2006 | maggs magnificent mild | silver medal | mild | siba national beer competition
(Other rows show regional SIBA awards and CAMRA/festival awards, which are not part of this claim.)

Step 3 — Explicitly count SIBA National awards for the beer within 1995–2009
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM west_berkshire_brewery WHERE "beer name" ILIKE 'maggs magnificent mild' AND competition ILIKE 'siba national beer competition' AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;
Result:
[{"count":2}]

Conclusion
- The data shows Maggs Magnificent Mild received two awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition within the 1995–2009 timeframe (2003 gold; 2006 silver). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Win an award” is interpreted to include any medal (gold/silver/bronze) at the competition, not only overall champion.
- The year range “between 1995 and 2009” is treated as inclusive.
- Matching is case-insensitive; competition naming exactly follows the table’s stored value “siba national beer competition.”
