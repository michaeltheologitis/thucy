Claim to verify: “Equestrian at the Asian Games happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010.”

Summary of findings:
- The equestrian-at-the-Asian-Games table shows editions in 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.
- The expected 4-year cadence from 1982 to 2010 would include 1990, but 1990 is missing in the data.
- Therefore, the statement that equestrian happened “every 4 year from 1982 to 2010” is contradicted by the data.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct years present (1980–2012)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year BETWEEN 1980 AND 2012 ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result:
  1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010

2) Distinct years present (1982–2010)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year BETWEEN 1982 AND 2010 ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010

3) Missing expected quadrennial years from 1982 to 2010 (inclusive)
- SQL:
  SELECT g.y AS missing_expected_year
  FROM generate_series(1982,2010,4) g(y)
  LEFT JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year BETWEEN 1982 AND 2010) e ON g.y = e.year
  WHERE e.year IS NULL
  ORDER BY g.y;
- Result:
  1990

4) Check for unexpected years in range that do not follow the 4-year cadence
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year AS unexpected_year
  FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1982 AND 2010
    AND year NOT IN (SELECT generate_series(1982,2010,4))
  ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  no rows (none)

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows a gap at 1990; hence, equestrian at the Asian Games did not occur in every 4-year interval from 1982 through 2010.

Assumptions:
- The table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games comprehensively reflects the years equestrian was held at the Asian Games.
- “Every 4 year from 1982 to 2010” is interpreted as the quadrennial sequence: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010.
