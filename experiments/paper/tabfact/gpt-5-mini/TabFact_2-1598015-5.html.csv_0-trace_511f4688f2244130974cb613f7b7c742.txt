Claim interpreted: In the available Chris DiMarco performance table, there are no wins in rows where both the “top - 25” and “top - 10” counts are less than 4.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.chris_dimarco with columns: tournament, wins, "top - 5", "top - 10", "top - 25", events, "cuts made".

Evidence 1: List rows where both thresholds are < 4
Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament, wins, "top - 10", "top - 25", CASE WHEN wins > 0 THEN true ELSE false END AS any_wins
FROM public.chris_dimarco
WHERE "top - 25" < 4 AND "top - 10" < 4
ORDER BY tournament;
Results:
- the open championship | wins: 0 | top - 10: 1 | top - 25: 2 | any_wins: false
- us open               | wins: 0 | top - 10: 1 | top - 25: 3 | any_wins: false

Evidence 2: Aggregate check (how many such rows have wins > 0)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_both_top25_top10_lt4 FROM public.chris_dimarco WHERE "top - 25" < 4 AND "top - 10" < 4;
Result: total_both_top25_top10_lt4 = 2

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS among_these_wins_gt0 FROM public.chris_dimarco WHERE "top - 25" < 4 AND "top - 10" < 4 AND wins > 0;
Result: among_these_wins_gt0 = 0

Conclusion: In all rows where both “top - 25” and “top - 10” are less than 4, wins are 0. This supports the claim that there is “no win” under those conditions in the available data.

Assumptions:
- “Less than 4” interpreted as strictly < 4.
- Analysis limited to the available public.chris_dimarco table in the TabFact database.
- Rows with NULL in "top - 10" or "top - 25" are excluded by the < operator (none appeared in the matching set).
