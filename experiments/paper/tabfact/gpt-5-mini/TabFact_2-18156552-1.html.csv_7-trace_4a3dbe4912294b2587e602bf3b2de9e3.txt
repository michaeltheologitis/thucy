Claim to verify: “NGC 1705 redshift faster than NGC 2082 by 441 km/s ± 6 km/s.”

What the data show
- NGC 1705 has radial (recessional) velocity 633 ± 6 km/s.
- NGC 2082 has radial (recessional) velocity 1184 ± 6 km/s.
- Therefore, NGC 1705 is slower than NGC 2082 by 551 km/s, not faster. Propagating the given ±6 km/s uncertainties (in quadrature) gives a difference uncertainty of ~8.49 km/s.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in both sign and magnitude. The measured difference is −551 ± 8.49 km/s (NGC 1705 − NGC 2082), not +441 ± 6 km/s.

Executed SQL evidence
1) Locate entries for the two objects and show their stored velocities
SQL:
SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name LIKE '%1705%' OR name LIKE '%2082%';
Results:
- ngc 2082 — 1184 ± 6 km/s
- ngc 1705 — 633 ± 6 km/s

2) Show tokenization used to parse the value and uncertainty
SQL:
SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" AS redshift_raw,
       split_part("redshift (km / s )", ' ', 1) AS rv_str,
       split_part("redshift (km / s )", ' ', 3) AS err_str
FROM public.dorado_group
WHERE name IN ('ngc 1705','ngc 2082');
Results (relevant fields):
- name = ngc 2082, redshift_raw = "1184 ± 6", rv_str = "1184", err_str = "6"
- name = ngc 1705, redshift_raw = "633 ± 6", rv_str = "633", err_str = "6"

3) Compute the velocity difference and propagated uncertainty
SQL:
WITH vals AS (
  SELECT name,
         split_part("redshift (km / s )",' ',1)::numeric AS rv_kms,
         split_part("redshift (km / s )",' ',3)::numeric AS rv_err_kms
  FROM public.dorado_group
  WHERE name IN ('ngc 1705','ngc 2082')
)
SELECT v1.name as name1, v1.rv_kms as rv1, v1.rv_err_kms as err1,
       v2.name as name2, v2.rv_kms as rv2, v2.rv_err_kms as err2,
       v1.rv_kms - v2.rv_kms as difference_kms,
       sqrt(v1.rv_err_kms^2 + v2.rv_err_kms^2) as diff_err_kms
FROM (SELECT * FROM vals WHERE name='ngc 1705') v1,
     (SELECT * FROM vals WHERE name='ngc 2082') v2;
Results:
- name1 = ngc 1705, rv1 = 633, err1 = 6
- name2 = ngc 2082, rv2 = 1184, err2 = 6
- difference_kms = −551
- diff_err_kms ≈ 8.4853

Assumptions
- “Redshift faster” is interpreted as higher radial/recessional velocity (km/s). The column "redshift (km / s )" is treated as radial velocity in km/s, consistent with its unit label.
