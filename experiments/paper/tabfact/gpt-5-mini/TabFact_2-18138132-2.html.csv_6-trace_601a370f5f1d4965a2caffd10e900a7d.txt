Summary:
- Claim: "twitter have the version of 1.0.0.3"
- Finding: In the available authoritative data (TabFact database, list_of_zune_applications table), the Twitter app entry has version 1.6, not 1.0.0.3. A different app (calendar) has version 1.0.0.3.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible data sources discovered: one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.

Schema examined:
- Table: list_of_zune_applications
  - Columns: title (text), developer (text), category (text), release date (text), version (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate any "twitter" app entries
- SQL executed:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM list_of_zune_applications
WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%twitter%';
- Result:
  - title: twitter; developer: matchbox; category: social networking; release date: 2010 - 12 - 16; version: 1.6
- Interpretation: The only entry matching “twitter” has version 1.6.

2) Check for any app with version exactly '1.0.0.3'
- SQL executed:
SELECT title, version FROM list_of_zune_applications WHERE version = '1.0.0.3';
- Result:
  - title: calendar; version: 1.0.0.3
- Interpretation: Version 1.0.0.3 exists for a different application (calendar), not for Twitter.

Conclusion:
- The data contradicts the claim. In this dataset, Twitter’s version is 1.6, not 1.0.0.3.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “twitter” as the app title within the TabFact table list_of_zune_applications.
- Title search was case-insensitive and matched any title containing the substring "twitter".
- Version comparison used exact string matching.
- All conclusions are scoped to the available TabFact database, which is treated as authoritative per the instructions.
