Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the TabFact database (table t_1998_in_paraguayan_football), there is no match on 1998-06-18, and the match on 1998-06-28 has a score of 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet), not 1 - 1.

Data sources discovered
- One PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1998_in_paraguayan_football with columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), comp (text), report (text)

Step 1 — Inspect sample rows to understand formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football LIMIT 10;
Results (abbrev.):
- 1998 - 03 - 18 — score: 1 - 1
- 1998 - 03 - 28 — score: 1 - 1
- 1998 - 06 - 01 — score: 5 - 1
- 1998 - 06 - 03 — score: 3 - 2
- 1998 - 06 - 06 — score: 1 - 0
(Shows date format as "YYYY - MM - DD" and score format like "G - G")

Step 2 — Query for the exact dates claimed (June 18 and June 28, 1998)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date IN ('1998 - 06 - 18','1998 - 06 - 28') ORDER BY date;
Result:
- 1998 - 06 - 28 — score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )
- 1998 - 06 - 18 — no row returned

Step 3 — Robust search for a June 18, 1998 match (allowing for formatting variations)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE regexp_replace(date, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') LIKE '%19980618%';
Result:
- 0 rows returned (no match on 1998-06-18)

Step 4 — Confirm the June 28, 1998 match and its score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
WHERE date ILIKE '%28%' OR date ILIKE '%jun%' OR date ILIKE '%june%' OR date ILIKE '%06%'
ORDER BY date
LIMIT 50;
Result includes:
- 1998 - 06 - 28 — score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score, regexp_replace(date,'\s*-\s*','-','g') AS normalized_date
FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
WHERE date ILIKE '%1998 - 06 - 28%';
Result:
- date: 1998 - 06 - 28; normalized_date: 1998-06-28; score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )

Step 5 — Check if any June 1998 match ended 1 - 1
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '1998 - 06 - %' AND score ~ '^\s*1\D+1\s*$';
Result: {"count": 0}

Executed SQL (list; returned no rows):
SELECT date, score FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '1998 - 06 - %' AND score ~ '^\s*1\D+1\s*$';

Finding summary
- No match exists on 1998-06-18 in this dataset.
- The 1998-06-28 match is recorded as 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet), not 1 - 1.
- There are no June 1998 matches with a 1 - 1 score in this table.

Assumptions
- “The game” refers to matches recorded in the TabFact.public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football table.
- “Score of 1 - 1” refers to the regulation-time score recorded in the score field. The 1998-06-28 entry explicitly shows 0 - 0 at full time with a 1 - 0 result after extra time (aet), which still is not 1 - 1.
