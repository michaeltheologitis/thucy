Claim interpreted: “3.22 million viewers watched ‘The Gold Job,’ directed by Arvin Brown.” I verified this against the available TabFact database (public schema) containing the table list_of_leverage_episodes.

Findings
- The episode titled “The Gold Job” is listed as directed by Marc Roskin, not Arvin Brown.
- Its U.S. viewership is 2.26 million, not 3.22 million.
- 3.22 million viewers corresponds to a different episode: “The Queen’s Gambit Job,” directed by Jonathan Frakes.
- Arvin Brown did direct other Leverage episodes, including “The Boiler Room Job” (3.29M viewers) and “The 10 Li’l Grifters Job” (2.46M viewers), but not “The Gold Job.”

Evidence (with executed SQL)
1) Details for “The Gold Job”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "title", "season", "original air date", "directed by", "us viewers (in millions)"
  FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
  WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Gold Job%';
- Result:
  - title: the gold job
  - season: 16
  - original air date: january 1 , 2012
  - directed by: marc roskin
  - us viewers (in millions): 2.26

2) Confirmation that “The Gold Job” is not directed by Arvin Brown
- SQL executed:
  SELECT title, "directed by", "us viewers (in millions)" FROM list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE lower(title) = 'the gold job';
- Result:
  - title: the gold job
  - directed by: marc roskin
  - us viewers (in millions): 2.26

3) Episodes directed by Arvin Brown
- SQL executed:
  SELECT title, "us viewers (in millions)" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Arvin Brown%';
- Results:
  - the 10 li'l grifters job — 2.46
  - the boiler room job — 3.29

4) Episodes around 3.22M viewers (to locate a potential source of confusion)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT title, "directed by", "us viewers (in millions)" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE "us viewers (in millions)" BETWEEN 3.1 AND 3.3 ORDER BY "us viewers (in millions)" DESC;
- Results:
  - the boiler room job — directed by arvin brown (3.29M)
  - the hot potato job — directed by john harrison (3.25M)
  - the 15 minutes job — directed by marc roskin (3.24M)
  - the queen 's gambit job — directed by jonathan frakes (3.22M)

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: “The Gold Job” had 2.26M U.S. viewers and was directed by Marc Roskin. 3.22M viewers pertains to “The Queen’s Gambit Job,” which was directed by Jonathan Frakes, not Arvin Brown.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the TV series “Leverage” episode titled “The Gold Job” and the viewership figure refers to U.S. viewers in millions as recorded in the list_of_leverage_episodes table.
