Claim to verify: “the score on 15 / 04 / 07 in super league xii be 52 to 22 with an attendance of 9000.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_2007_bradford_bulls_season

Schema (from inspection):
- Columns: date (text), home team (text), score (text), away team (text), goals (text), attendance (bigint), competition (text)

Evidence queries and results:
1) Retrieve the match on 15 / 04 / 07 in Super League XII
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", score, "away team", attendance, competition
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE "date" = '15 / 04 / 07' AND LOWER(competition) = 'super league xii';
Result (one row):
{ "date": "15 / 04 / 07", "home team": "bradford", "score": "52 - 22", "away team": "hull kr", "attendance": 10881, "competition": "super league xii" }

2) Check exact score formatting and attendance 9000
SQL:
SELECT score, attendance, (score IN ('52-22', '52–22')) AS score_is_52_22_exact, (attendance = 9000) AS attendance_is_9000
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE "date" = '15 / 04 / 07' AND LOWER(competition) = 'super league xii';
Result:
{ "score": "52 - 22", "attendance": 10881, "score_is_52_22_exact": false, "attendance_is_9000": false }

3) Distinct competition values (to confirm casing)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT competition FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season;
Result:
["rugby league challenge cup", "super league xii"]

Assessment:
- Score: The match on 15 / 04 / 07 in Super League XII finished 52 - 22. This matches the claim’s “52 to 22” (formatting differs only by the hyphen vs. “to”). Supported by Query 1.
- Attendance: The recorded attendance is 10,881, not 9,000. This contradicts the claim. Supported by Queries 1 and 2.

Conclusion: The score is correct; the attendance is incorrect.

Assumptions:
- The date format “15 / 04 / 07” refers to 15 April 2007 as stored in the table with spaces around slashes.
- “52 to 22” is treated as equivalent to the recorded “52 - 22” score formatting.
