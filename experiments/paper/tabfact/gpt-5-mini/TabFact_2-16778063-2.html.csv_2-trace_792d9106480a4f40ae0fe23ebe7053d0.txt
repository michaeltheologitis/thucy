Claim interpreted: The Week 14 opponent is an away game at the Cleveland Browns.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a single accessible database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season (2001 Cincinnati Bengals season schedule). Columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance.

Evidence:
1) Week 14 opponent for the 2001 Cincinnati Bengals
SQL executed:
SELECT week, opponent FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 14;
Returned row:
{"week":14, "opponent":"new york jets"}
Conclusion from query 1: Week 14 opponent is the New York Jets.

2) Check if Week 14 indicates an away game "at" Cleveland Browns
SQL executed:
SELECT week, opponent, (opponent ILIKE '%cleveland%' OR opponent ILIKE '%browns%') AS mentions_cleveland_browns, (opponent LIKE '%@%' OR opponent ILIKE '% at %' OR opponent ILIKE 'at %') AS indicates_away FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 14;
Returned row:
{"week":14, "opponent":"new york jets", "mentions_cleveland_browns":false, "indicates_away":false}
Conclusion from query 2: Week 14 does not mention Cleveland/Browns and does not indicate an away marker ("@" or "at").

3) When did the Bengals play the Cleveland Browns in 2001?
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Browns%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Cleveland%';
Results:
- week: 5, date: october 14 , 2001, opponent: cleveland browns, result: w 24 - 14, attendance: 64217
- week: 11, date: november 25 , 2001, opponent: cleveland browns, result: l 18 - 0, attendance: 72918
Conclusion from query 3: The Cleveland Browns were opponents in Weeks 5 and 11, not Week 14.

Overall assessment: Based on the only available authoritative schedule data (2001 Cincinnati Bengals), the Week 14 opponent is the New York Jets, not an away game at the Cleveland Browns. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Cleveland brown" refers to the NFL team Cleveland Browns.
- "at" denotes an away game. Away indicators were inferred from the presence of "@" or the word "at" in the opponent field.
- The claim pertains to the only available season dataset (2001 Cincinnati Bengals) in the connected data source.
