Summary of findings
- I explored the available data sources and found a single relevant table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season in the postgres_tabfact14 database, which lists the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season game-by-game.
- The season’s last game (by the maximum week number) is dated “december 7 , 1947.” The date “august 31 , 1947” is the first game, not the last.
- Therefore, the claim that “august 31 1947 [is] the date of the last game of the season” is contradicted by the data in the only relevant table available.

Supporting evidence (with exact executed SQL)
1) Full schedule view (ordered by week)
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
ORDER BY week;
Key rows from the result:
- Week 1: date = "august 31 , 1947" (first game)
- Week 14: date = "december 7 , 1947" (last game)

2) First game of the season (minimum week)
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = (SELECT MIN(week) FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season);
Result:
- Week 1, Date: august 31 , 1947, Opponent: brooklyn dodgers, Result: w, Score: 23 - 7

3) Last game of the season (maximum week)
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = (SELECT MAX(week) FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season);
Result:
- Week 14, Date: december 7 , 1947, Opponent: buffalo bills, Result: t, Score: 21 - 21

Conclusion
- The data shows the last game date is December 7, 1947. August 31, 1947 was the first game of the season, not the last.

Assumptions
- “The season” refers to the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season, which is the only sports-season dataset available in the connected data source.
- “Last game” is determined by the highest week number in the table (Week 14).
