Summary
- Data source discovered: TabFact (public schema) with table t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league containing two-legged tie results (columns: "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg").
- Goal: Verify the claim that the first-leg score was 1 - 3 for a tie where team 1 = Panathinaikos and team 2 = Liverpool.

Step 1: Exact match search for Panathinaikos vs Liverpool
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league WHERE "team 1" = 'Panathinaikos' AND "team 2" = 'Liverpool';
Result: No matching row.

Step 2: Case-insensitive search for either order (Panathinaikos–Liverpool or Liverpool–Panathinaikos)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE ("team 1" ILIKE '%panathinaikos%' AND "team 2" ILIKE '%liverpool%')
   OR ("team 1" ILIKE '%liverpool%' AND "team 2" ILIKE '%panathinaikos%');
Query result: match_count = 0
Interpretation: The table contains no tie between Panathinaikos and Liverpool.

Step 3: Show all ties involving Liverpool (to understand available entries and score formats)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1","team 2","1st leg","2nd leg","agg" FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Liverpool%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Liverpool%';
Result:
- team 1: lille | team 2: liverpool | 1st leg: 1 - 0 | 2nd leg: 0 - 3 | agg: 1 - 3

Step 4: Show all ties involving Panathinaikos
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Panathinaikos%'
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Panathinaikos%';
Result:
- team 1: panathinaikos | team 2: standard liège | 1st leg: 1 - 3 | 2nd leg: 0 - 1 | agg: 1 - 4

Assessment
- There is no record in the 2009–10 Europa League table of a tie between Panathinaikos (team 1) and Liverpool (team 2), in either order.
- The first-leg score 1 - 3 appears for Panathinaikos vs Standard Liège, not against Liverpool.
- The only Liverpool tie shown is Lille vs Liverpool, where the first leg was 1 - 0 (not 1 - 3), and the aggregate was 1 - 3.

Conclusion
The claim that “the first leg score be 1 - 3 for the match with a team 1 of Panathinaikos and a team 2 of Liverpool” is not supported by the available data. No such matchup exists in the dataset, and the 1 - 3 first-leg score for Panathinaikos pertains to a different opponent (Standard Liège).

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the available table t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league (2009–10 UEFA Europa League). If the claim refers to a different season or competition, it would be outside this dataset.
- Team names were searched case-insensitively and in both orders to account for potential listing variations.
