Claim: “the highest scoring game of the season be against the angel on september 8 final score be 12 - 10.”

Summary conclusion: Verified by the available dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays table containing September games). The September 8 game vs the Angels ended 12 - 10, and its combined 22 runs are the highest total in the table.

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL):

1) Confirm the September 8 game vs Angels and its score
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows:
- date: "september 8", opponent: "angels", score: "12 - 10" (also shows surrounding September dates and opponents)

2) Compute the maximum combined runs in any game
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX((regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int + regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int)) AS max_total
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season;
Result:
- max_total = 22

3) List all games that match that maximum combined total
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score,
 (regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int + regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int) AS combined_runs
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE (regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int + regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*([0-9]+).*', '\\1')::int) = 22;
Result:
- date: "september 8", opponent: "angels", score: "12 - 10", combined_runs: 22 (only row returned)

Additional context on dataset scope
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 50;
Result shows only September dates (e.g., "september 1" … "september 28"), indicating this table contains September games.

Assessment
- The September 8 game vs Angels ended 12 - 10.
- Its combined runs (22) are the highest in the dataset, and no other game ties this total.

Assumptions
- “Highest scoring game” is interpreted as the game with the highest combined runs (both teams).
- “Season” is taken to refer to the scope of the provided table, which contains the team’s September games for 1997 (the only data available here).
