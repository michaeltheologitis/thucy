Claim to verify: "sco have the highest amount of transfer at 22, more than every other team combine."

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact (postgres_tabfact7)" with public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  - Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text)

What the data shows
1) Count by nationality (nat)
SQL executed:
SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- sco: 22
- eng: 2
- bel: 2
- esp: 1
- rsa: 1
- fra: 1
- gabon: 1
- ivory coast: 1
- slovakia: 1
- cyp: 1

2) Check if "sco" count exceeds the combined count of all others
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nat='sco') AS sco_count, (COUNT(*) - COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nat='sco')) AS other_count, (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nat='sco') > (COUNT(*) - COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nat='sco'))) AS sco_gt_others FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
Result:
- sco_count = 22
- other_count = 11
- sco_gt_others = true

Interpretation
- Within this table, entries with nat = 'sco' total 22, which is the highest among all nationalities and greater than the sum of all other nationalities combined (11).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in this table: 'sco' has 22 entries, more than every other group combined.

Assumptions and scope notes
- 'sco' is interpreted as the Scottish nationality code in the nat column.
- "transfer" is interpreted broadly as any player movement row recorded in this table (including loans and end of contract), not just rows where type = 'transfer'. If restricted only to type = 'transfer', 'sco' has 1, not 22.
- "team combine" is interpreted as all other nationalities combined in this table.
- Scope is limited to the dataset available (Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season table); no broader league-wide or multi-team database was available through the connected sources.
