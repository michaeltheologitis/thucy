Data source discovery:
- Found one database: postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact), public schema.
- Found one relevant table: media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner).

Evidence gathered:
1) Targeted lookup for Astral Media-owned entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%Astral Media%';
Result:
- call sign: ckfr | frequency: 1150 am | branding: am 1150 | owner: astral media

2) Full table scan for context
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM media_in_kelowna;
Relevant row observed among results:
- frequency: 1150 am | call sign: ckfr | branding: am 1150 | format: news / talk | owner: astral media

Analysis:
- The media_in_kelowna table lists a station owned by Astral Media whose call sign is recorded as "ckfr" (case-insensitive match to CKFR). This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion: The available data supports that Astral Media’s radio station (in the Kelowna dataset) has the call sign CKFR.

Assumptions:
- "Astral Media’s radio station" refers to the entry in the media_in_kelowna table with owner "astral media".
- Call sign comparisons are case-insensitive ("ckfr" ≡ "CKFR").
