Claim to verify: "the average service be less than 7, when year > 2003, industry < 1465, and regional gva > 9432"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL via postgres_tabfact5 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.my_info_table with columns: year (bigint), industry (bigint), services (bigint), "regional gva" (bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Check the average of services under the exact filters
- SQL:
  SELECT AVG(services)::numeric AS avg_services, COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE year > 2003 AND industry < 1465 AND "regional gva" > 9432;
- Result: avg_services = NULL, row_count = 0
- Interpretation: No rows satisfy the filters; AVG is undefined (NULL).

2) Understand overall data ranges
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: row_count = 5
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year, MAX(year) AS max_year,
         MIN(industry) AS min_industry, MAX(industry) AS max_industry,
         MIN(services) AS min_services, MAX(services) AS max_services,
         MIN("regional gva") AS min_regional_gva, MAX("regional gva") AS max_regional_gva
  FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result:
  - year: 1995 to 2007
  - industry: 1110 to 1565
  - services: 3632 to 7856
  - regional gva: 4753 to 9432
- Note: The maximum "regional gva" equals 9432, so the condition "regional gva > 9432" cannot be satisfied by any row.

3) Sanity check with relaxed conditions
- SQL:
  SELECT AVG(services) AS avg_services, MIN(services) AS min_services,
         MAX(services) AS max_services, COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE year > 2003 AND industry < 1465;
- Result: avg_services = NULL, min_services = NULL, max_services = NULL, row_count = 0
- Interpretation: Even without the regional gva filter, no rows meet year > 2003 and industry < 1465 simultaneously in this table.

Assessment:
- The specified filter set yields zero rows; thus the average of services is undefined, not a numeric value less than 7. The claim is not supported by the data.
- Moreover, the observed services values range from 3632 to 7856, so any non-empty subset’s average could not be less than 7 under this dataset.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim. There is no evidence that the average of services under the stated conditions is less than 7; in fact, the conditions produce no rows, and the scale of services values makes such an average impossible in this table.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "service" as the column "services" in public.my_info_table.
- Interpreted the conditions as strict inequalities: year > 2003, industry < 1465, and "regional gva" > 9432.
- Treated the column name with space exactly as "regional gva" (quoted in SQL).
