Claim to verify: “the only person list as a prison escapist have a status of dead.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22), schema: public, with one table: public.cube_film_series.
- Table schema (relevant columns): name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), "prison connection" (text), "played by" (text), status (text).

Step 1: Check whether “prison escapist” appears and how many times
A) Distinct values of occupation with counts
SQL:
SELECT occupation, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.cube_film_series
GROUP BY occupation
ORDER BY count DESC NULLS LAST;
Result excerpt:
- prison escapist: 1

B) Case-insensitive check for “prison escapist” within occupation
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%prison escapist%';
Result: count = 1

Step 2: Retrieve the row(s) labeled “prison escapist” and verify status
SQL:
SELECT name, occupation, "prison connection", status
FROM public.cube_film_series
WHERE occupation = 'prison escapist';
Result:
- name: rennes; occupation: prison escapist; prison connection: centre pãnitentiaire de rennes (france); status: dead

Confirmation (names and statuses for rows matching case-insensitive search)
SQL:
SELECT name, status FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%prison escapist%' ORDER BY name;
Result:
- name: rennes, status: dead

Conclusion
- There is exactly one entry with occupation “prison escapist,” and that entry’s status is “dead.” The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “person list as a prison escapist” as any record in public.cube_film_series whose occupation equals or contains “prison escapist.”
- Case-insensitive checks were used to ensure no capitalization variants were missed.
