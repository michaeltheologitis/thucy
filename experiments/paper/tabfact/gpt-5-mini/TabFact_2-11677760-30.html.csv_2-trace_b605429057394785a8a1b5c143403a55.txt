Data source discovery:
- Found one authoritative PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema). Relevant table: public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team with columns (player, height, school, hometown, college).

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, school, college FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE 'Perry Ellis';
- Result:
  player = perry ellis; school = wichita heights high school; college = kansas

Assessment of the claim:
- "perry ellis go to wichita height high school": Supported, with a minor spelling correction. Data shows "Wichita Heights High School" (the claim omits the trailing "s").
- "and attend kansa college": Supported, with a minor spelling correction. Data shows "Kansas" as the college (commonly the University of Kansas). The claim’s "kansa" appears to refer to Kansas.

Conclusion:
- The database directly supports that Perry Ellis attended Wichita Heights High School and went to college at Kansas.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "kansa college" as the University of Kansas (commonly referred to as Kansas).
