Claim interpreted: “the 4th game on the list be a higher scoring game than the sixth game on the list.” I interpret “the list” as the table of matchups in public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs, in its natural returned order, and “game” as the two-legged tie between Team 1 and Team 2. “Higher scoring” is interpreted as the total number of open‑play goals across both legs (penalty shootouts excluded).

Data source discovery
- Available relational source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22) with table public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- Columns: "team 1" text, "agg" text, "team 2" text, "1st leg" text, "2nd leg" text.

Step 1 — Establish the row order and identify the 4th and 6th entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT row_number() OVER () AS rn, "team 1", "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg, "team 2"
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;

Relevant returned rows:
- rn=4: team 1 = lprc oilers, 1st leg = "1 - 0", 2nd leg = "1 - 3", agg = "2 - 3", team 2 = mighty blackpool
- rn=6: team 1 = port autonome, 1st leg = "0 - 0", 2nd leg = "0 - 0", agg = "0 - 0 (1 - 3)", team 2 = sporting clube da praia

(For full context, the table rows without numbering were also retrieved earlier with: SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;)

Step 2 — Compute total open-play goals (sum of goals in 1st and 2nd legs) for rows 4 and 6
Executed SQL:
WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT row_number() OVER () AS rn, "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
)
SELECT rn, "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg",
  ( (regexp_matches("1st leg", '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1]::int + (regexp_matches("1st leg", '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2]::int
    + (regexp_matches("2nd leg", '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1]::int + (regexp_matches("2nd leg", '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2]::int
  ) AS total_goals
FROM numbered
WHERE rn IN (4,6)
ORDER BY rn;

Returned results:
- rn=4 | lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool | 1st leg "1 - 0" | 2nd leg "1 - 3" | total_goals = 5
- rn=6 | port autonome vs sporting clube da praia | 1st leg "0 - 0" | 2nd leg "0 - 0" | total_goals = 0

Conclusion
- The 4th game (total 5 goals) is higher scoring than the 6th game (total 0 goals). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “The list” refers to the natural returned order of rows from public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (row_number() OVER () without ORDER BY).
- “Game” refers to the two-legged tie represented by each row.
- “Higher scoring” compares total open‑play goals across both legs; penalty shootout data in agg is excluded.
