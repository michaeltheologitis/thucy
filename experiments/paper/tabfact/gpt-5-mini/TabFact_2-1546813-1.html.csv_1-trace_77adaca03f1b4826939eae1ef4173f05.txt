Results:
- united states — 8 wins
- europe — 5 wins

4) United States wins up to and including 2009
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS us_wins_up_to_2009 FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE LOWER("winning team") = 'united states' AND year <= 2009;

Assessment
- The event starts in 1990 (first record is 1990).
- The United States has 8 total wins in the dataset and 8 wins through 2009.
- The most recent U.S. win is 2009.
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Treated the value in "winning team" as case-insensitive (matched 'united states').
- Interpreted “the last be in 2009” as “the most recent U.S. win was in 2009.”
