Claim to verify: “83% be the total of all shot pct occurrence when the value of blank end be 8.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows that when blank ends = 8, the shot pct is 80%, not 83%. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Data discovery
- Available data sources (tool: discover_data_sources): Verified one PostgreSQL database with a relevant table: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier (Tim Hortons Brier, a curling event). Another table present is t_1989_u_s_open_golf (not relevant here).

Schema inspection (tool: schema_query)
- Table: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
- Relevant columns (with spaces in names): "blank ends" (bigint), "shot pct" (text)
- This table structure matches the terminology in the claim (blank ends, shot pct).

Evidence from executed SQL (tool: nl_query_traceable)
1) Rows where blank ends = 8, showing skip, blank ends, and shot pct
SQL executed:
SELECT "skip", "blank ends", "shot pct" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 8;
Result:
- skip: jean - michel mãnard | blank ends: 8 | shot pct: 80%

2) Count of rows where blank ends = 8
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 8;
Result:
- count_rows: 1

3) Distinct shot pct values where blank ends = 8
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "shot pct" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 8 ORDER BY "shot pct";
Result:
- 80%

Supplemental checks
4) Any rows with shot pct = '83%' and their blank ends values
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "shot pct" = '83%';
Result:
- locale: nova scotia | skip: shawn adams | blank ends: 16 | shot pct: 83%

5) Distribution of blank ends by shot pct in 80%–85% range
SQL executed:
SELECT "shot pct", "blank ends", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "shot pct" IN ('80%','81%','82%','83%','84%','85%') GROUP BY "shot pct", "blank ends" ORDER BY "shot pct", "blank ends";
Result (shot pct | blank ends | count):
- 80% | 8  | 1
- 80% | 12 | 1
- 80% | 18 | 1
- 82% | 10 | 1
- 83% | 16 | 1

Interpretation
- There is exactly one row with blank ends = 8, and its shot pct is 80%.
- The only row with shot pct = 83% has blank ends = 16, not 8.
- No evidence indicates 83% is the shot pct (or any aggregate thereof) associated with blank ends = 8.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: when blank ends = 8, shot pct is 80%, not 83%.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “blank end be 8” as rows where the column "blank ends" equals 8.
- Interpreted “total of all shot pct occurrence” as the shot pct value(s) associated with those rows (since only one row exists, there is no aggregation ambiguity).
