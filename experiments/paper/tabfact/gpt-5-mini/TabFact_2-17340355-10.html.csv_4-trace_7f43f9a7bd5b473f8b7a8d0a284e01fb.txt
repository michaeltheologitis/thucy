Claim: "the game against new orleans didn't have the highest attendance"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season. Columns: game, date, team, "location attendance", record.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect all rows to understand formats
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", record FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season ORDER BY game;
Key rows (subset):
- game 77: team dallas, location attendance "american airlines center 20301"
- game 78: team new orleans, location attendance "new orleans arena 17781"

2) Compute numeric attendance for each row by extracting trailing digits from "location attendance"
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance",
CASE WHEN regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> '' THEN CAST(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer) ELSE NULL END AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
ORDER BY game;
Result highlights:
- New Orleans game (game 78): attendance = 17781
- Dallas game (game 77): attendance = 20301 (appears largest)

3) Compute the maximum attendance across the dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> '' THEN CAST(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer) ELSE NULL END) AS max_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season;
Result:
- max_attendance = 20301

4) Show the game(s) that reached the maximum attendance
SQL executed:
WITH cte AS (
  SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance",
  CASE WHEN regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> '' THEN CAST(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer) ELSE NULL END AS attendance
  FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
)
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", attendance
FROM cte
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM cte)
ORDER BY game;
Result:
- game 77, date: april 5, team: dallas, location attendance: "american airlines center 20301", attendance: 20301

5) Confirm the New Orleans game attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance",
CASE WHEN regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> '' THEN CAST(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer) ELSE NULL END AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team = 'new orleans';
Result:
- game 78, date: april 8, team: new orleans, location attendance: "new orleans arena 17781", attendance: 17781

Findings
- Maximum attendance in the dataset is 20,301 (game 77 vs Dallas).
- The New Orleans game attendance is 17,781, which is less than the maximum.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows the game against New Orleans did not have the highest attendance within this dataset.

Assumptions
- The trailing number in "location attendance" is the attendance figure; rows without digits are treated as missing attendance.
- Verification is based on the available rows in public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (games 75–82). If a broader scope was intended, this conclusion applies to the data accessible here.
