Claim interpreted: The user asserts that in the 2007–2008 season, September 26, 2007 was the season finale.

Data source exploration:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table discovered: csi_franchise
  - Columns include: season, episodes, time slot (est), season premiere, season finale, tv season, rank, viewers (in millions).

Evidence from the data:
1) Identify how the 2007–2008 season is represented in the table
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "tv season" FROM csi_franchise WHERE "tv season" LIKE '%2007%';
- Purpose: Determine exact string variant for the 2007–2008 season.

2) Retrieve the row for the 2007–2008 season
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "tv season", "season premiere", "season finale", episodes, rank, "viewers (in millions)" 
FROM csi_franchise
WHERE "tv season" IN ('2007–08','2007-08','2007 - 2008');
- Result:
  - season: 4
  - tv season: 2007 - 2008
  - season premiere: september 26 , 2007
  - season finale: may 21 , 2008
  - episodes: 21
  - rank: 28
  - viewers (in millions): 11.71

Assessment:
- The data shows that for the 2007–2008 season, September 26, 2007 is the season premiere, not the season finale. The season finale is May 21, 2008. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the "tv season" labeled 2007–2008 in the csi_franchise table and the associated premiere/finale dates recorded there.
- Variants of the season label (2007–08, 2007-08, 2007 - 2008) are treated as equivalent representations of the same season.
