Claim evaluated: “the winner / nominee(s) of the 2007 favorite movie actor be rosie o'donnell.”

Summary of finding
- The available data shows that for 2007 in the “favorite movie actor” category, the listed person is Jack Black (for Nacho Libre), with result “nominated.” There is no mention of Rosie O'Donnell in any 2007 entries.

Evidence from the database
Data source: postgres_tabfact9 (public.nickelodeon_movies)

1) Inspect all 2007 rows
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM nickelodeon_movies WHERE year = 2007 LIMIT 50;
Results:
- {"category":"favorite movie actor","film":"nacho libre","result":"nominated","winner / nominee (s)":"jack black","year":2007}
- {"category":"favorite movie actress","film":"charlotte 's web","result":"won","winner / nominee (s)":"dakota fanning","year":2007}

2) Retrieve the 2007 “favorite movie actor” entry explicitly
SQL executed:
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result
FROM nickelodeon_movies
WHERE year = 2007 AND LOWER(category) = 'favorite movie actor';
Results:
- {"year":2007,"category":"favorite movie actor","film":"nacho libre","winner / nominee (s)":"jack black","result":"nominated"}

3) Check for any 2007 entries mentioning Rosie O'Donnell
SQL executed:
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result
FROM nickelodeon_movies
WHERE year = 2007;
Results:
- {"year":2007,"category":"favorite movie actor","film":"nacho libre","winner / nominee (s)":"jack black","result":"nominated"}
- {"year":2007,"category":"favorite movie actress","film":"charlotte 's web","winner / nominee (s)":"dakota fanning","result":"won"}
Interpretation: No 2007 rows mention Rosie O'Donnell in the “winner / nominee (s)” field.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: the 2007 “favorite movie actor” entry lists Jack Black (nominated), not Rosie O'Donnell.

Assumptions
- This table represents Nickelodeon-related movie awards/categories and stores category names in lowercase. Searches were case-insensitive for categories and exact for names as stored. If alternate punctuation (e.g., curly apostrophes) or variant spellings are needed, further searches can be run, but they will not change the observed 2007 “favorite movie actor” entry.
