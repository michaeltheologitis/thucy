Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret the user’s claim as: “The Buffalo Bills played (before Week 7) at the Dallas Cowboys in Tulane Stadium.” This implies Tulane Stadium was the venue for a Cowboys home game before Week 7 involving the Bills.

What data is available
- Available dataset: a single table covering the 1970 New York Giants season (public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season). While it does not include Buffalo Bills games directly, it contains opponents, game sites, and weeks that let us verify which teams were associated with Tulane Stadium and where Cowboys home games were played in that season.

Evidence gathered
1) Search for any mentions of Tulane Stadium, Cowboys, or Dallas in the 1970 Giants schedule
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE LOWER("game site") LIKE '%tulane stadium%' OR LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%cowboys%' OR LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%dallas%';

Results:
- Week 2 — Date: 1970 - 09 - 27 — Opponent: dallas cowboys — Result: l 28 - 10 — Game site: cotton bowl
- Week 3 — Date: 1970 - 10 - 04 — Opponent: new orleans saints — Result: l 14 - 10 — Game site: tulane stadium
- Week 8 — Date: 1970 - 11 - 08 — Opponent: dallas cowboys — Result: w 23 - 20 — Game site: yankee stadium

Takeaways:
- Tulane Stadium appears for a game against the New Orleans Saints (Week 3), not the Cowboys.
- Cowboys-related game sites in this data are Cotton Bowl (Dallas home) and Yankee Stadium (Giants home), not Tulane Stadium.

2) Explicitly list distinct game sites for Giants vs Cowboys, and check for Tulane Stadium
Executed SQL (Cowboys game sites):
SELECT DISTINCT "game site" FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Cowboys%';
Results:
- cotton bowl
- yankee stadium

Executed SQL (Tulane Stadium check):
SELECT DISTINCT "game site" FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE "game site" = 'Tulane Stadium';
Result: no rows

Executed SQL (case-insensitive Tulane check):
SELECT DISTINCT "game site" FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE "game site" ILIKE '%tulane%';
Result:
- tulane stadium

Conclusions from evidence
- Within the available authoritative data (1970 Giants season):
  - Tulane Stadium is associated with the New Orleans Saints, not the Dallas Cowboys.
  - Cowboys home venue in this dataset is the Cotton Bowl; there is no instance of the Cowboys playing at Tulane Stadium.
  - Therefore, the portion of the claim that places a Dallas Cowboys game at Tulane Stadium is contradicted by the data.
- The dataset does not include Buffalo Bills games, so it cannot confirm any Bills-specific matchup or week. However, the stadium-team association in the claim is incorrect based on the evidence.

Final assessment
- The claim that a Dallas Cowboys game (hosting) took place at Tulane Stadium is contradicted by the data. With no Bills data here to support the rest of the statement, the overall claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user’s text as asserting that the Bills played the Cowboys before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium (i.e., a Cowboys home game at Tulane Stadium). The data used is limited to the 1970 NY Giants season; conclusions about stadium-team associations are based on that season’s authoritative records in this dataset.
