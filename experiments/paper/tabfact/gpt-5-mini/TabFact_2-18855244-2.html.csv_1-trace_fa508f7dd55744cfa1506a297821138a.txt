Claim: “larisa latyna have 7 more medal than carl osburn.”

Conclusion: Supported by the data. The maximum recorded Olympic medal totals in the available dataset are 18 for Larisa Latynina and 11 for Carl Osburn, a difference of 7.

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact10)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  - Columns: "medal count" (bigint), "date" (text), "athlete" (text), "nation" (text), "sport" (text), "record medal event" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate entries for each athlete (to inspect available medal counts)
- SQL:
  SELECT athlete, "medal count" FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%larisa latynina%';
  Result rows:
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 13
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 14
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 15
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 16
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 17
  - athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 18

- SQL:
  SELECT athlete, "medal count" FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%carl osburn%';
  Result rows:
  - athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 8
  - athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 9
  - athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 10
  - athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 11

Interpretation: The table records multiple entries per athlete with increasing medal counts, so we use the maximum per athlete to represent their total medals.

2) Compute maximum medal count per athlete and the difference
- SQL (Larisa Latynina max):
  SELECT MAX("medal count") AS max_medals FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE 'larisa latynina';
  Result: max_medals = 18

- SQL (Carl Osburn max):
  SELECT MAX("medal count") AS max_medals FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE 'carl osburn';
  Result: max_medals = 11

- SQL (Difference):
  SELECT (lat.max_medals - carl.max_medals) AS difference FROM (SELECT MAX("medal count") AS max_medals FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE 'larisa latynina') lat, (SELECT MAX("medal count") AS max_medals FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE 'carl osburn') carl;
  Result: difference = 7

Answer: The data shows Larisa Latynina has 7 more medals than Carl Osburn.

Assumptions made
- “larisa latyna” refers to Larisa Latynina; “carl osburn” refers to Carl Osburn.
- “medal” refers to total Olympic medals (gold, silver, and bronze combined).
- Because the table has multiple rows per athlete with growing totals, we use the maximum medal count per athlete as their total medals.
- Name matching is case-insensitive using ILIKE as shown in the queries.
