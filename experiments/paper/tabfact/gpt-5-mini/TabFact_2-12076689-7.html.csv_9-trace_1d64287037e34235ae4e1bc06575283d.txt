Claim interpreted: There were four different baseball games where the final score was 9–2.

Available data sources (discovery and schema overview):
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single table available: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season.
- Table schema (from schema inspection): date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Why this data is relevant: The only available dataset is a full season game log for one MLB team (2006 Texas Rangers), containing game-by-game final scores. While it does not cover all baseball, it is the only authoritative data available via the connected tools, so verification is performed within this data’s scope.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Inspect score formatting to ensure proper matching
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 15;
- Observation from results: The score field is stored as text in the format "X - Y" (e.g., "7 - 2", "9 - 6").

2) Count exact matches for 9–2 (in either order)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_games FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score IN ('9 - 2','2 - 9');
- Result: num_games = 0

3) Robust match using regular expressions (allowing arbitrary whitespace)
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
WHERE score ~ E'^\s*(9[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*2|2[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*9)\s*$';
- Result: match_count = 0

- Executed SQL (attempt to list matching rows; none found):
SELECT date, opponent, score
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
WHERE score ~ E'^\s*(9[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*2|2[[:space:]]*-[[:space:]]*9)\s*$'
ORDER BY date;
- Result: empty result set (no matching games)

Findings:
- Within the only accessible dataset (the 2006 Texas Rangers season), there are zero games with a final score of 9–2 (in either order). Therefore, the claim that there were four such games is not supported by the available evidence.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the evidence available in the connected, authoritative data source.

Assumptions made:
- Scope limitation: Because only one game-log table (2006 Texas Rangers) is available via the connected data tools, I verified the claim within this dataset. The claim could refer to all of baseball across seasons/teams, but that cannot be verified with the available data here.
