Claim: ASC Diaraf lost to Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Evidence from data:
- The table contains a tie between ASC Diaraf and Stade Malien with an aggregate score showing ASC Diaraf lost.

Executed SQL (and results):
1) Query to find ties involving ASC Diaraf in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs:
SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE lower("team 1") LIKE '%diaraf%' OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%diaraf%';
Result row:
{ "team 1": "asc diaraf", "agg": "3 - 4", "team 2": "stade malien", "1st leg": "3 - 0", "2nd leg": "0 - 4" }

2) Query to parse the aggregate and determine whether ASC Diaraf lost the tie:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", agg,
CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(agg,'\\s','', 'g'),'-',1) AS integer) AS team1_score,
CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(agg,'\\s','', 'g'),'-',2) AS integer) AS team2_score,
(CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(agg,'\\s','', 'g'),'-',1) AS integer) < CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(agg,'\\s','', 'g'),'-',2) AS integer)) AS team1_lost
FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE lower("team 1") LIKE '%diaraf%' OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%diaraf%';
Result row:
{ "team 1": "asc diaraf", "team 2": "stade malien", "agg": "3 - 4", "team1_score": 3, "team2_score": 4, "team1_lost": true }

Interpretation:
- The tie lists ASC Diaraf as team 1 and Stade Malien as team 2.
- Aggregate score is 3-4, so ASC Diaraf lost on aggregate.
- Legs: ASC Diaraf won 3-0 in the 1st leg but lost 0-4 in the 2nd leg, resulting in a 3-4 aggregate loss.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Case-insensitive matching was used for team names.
- The table t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs represents ties from the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs, with the aggregate formatted as "team 1 goals - team 2 goals".
