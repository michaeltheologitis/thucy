Summary conclusion
Based on the IMViC dataset available (public.imvic), every species that is indole positive is also methyl red positive. No counterexamples were found in the data.

Data source and schema inspected
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: imvic
  - Columns: species (text), indole (text), "methyl red" (text), "voges - proskauer" (text), citrate (text)

Key evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Check for any violations (indole = 'positive' with methyl red not 'positive' or NULL)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM imvic WHERE indole = 'positive' AND ("methyl red" IS NULL OR "methyl red" <> 'positive');
Result:
count
0
Interpretation: There are zero records where a species is indole positive but not methyl red positive.

2) Attempt to list any violating species (none returned)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT species, "methyl red" FROM imvic WHERE indole = 'positive' AND ("methyl red" IS NULL OR "methyl red" <> 'positive') ORDER BY species;
Result: no rows
Interpretation: Confirms no counterexamples exist.

3) List all species with indole = 'positive' and show their methyl red result
SQL:
SELECT species, "methyl red" FROM imvic WHERE indole = 'positive' ORDER BY species;
Results:
- escherichia coli — methyl red: positive
- proteus vulgaris — methyl red: positive
Interpretation: All indole-positive species in the table are methyl red positive.

4) Distinct value combinations observed (context)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT indole, "methyl red" FROM imvic;
Results include:
- {indole: "negative", methyl red: "negative"}
- {indole: "negative", methyl red: "positive"}
- {indole: "positive", methyl red: "positive"}
Interpretation: No row exists with indole = "positive" and methyl red = "negative" in this dataset.

Conclusion
Within the public.imvic dataset, the implication holds: if a species tests positive for indole, it also tests positive for methyl red. No exceptions were found.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as an implication over the species records in the public.imvic table: for all rows where indole = 'positive', methyl red must also equal 'positive'.
- String comparisons were performed exactly as stored (lowercase 'positive'/'negative').
