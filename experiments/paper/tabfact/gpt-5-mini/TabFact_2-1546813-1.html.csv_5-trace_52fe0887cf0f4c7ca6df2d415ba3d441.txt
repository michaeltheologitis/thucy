- SQL executed:

- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS total_editions FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013;
- Result:
  total_editions: 13

3) Count hosted outside the United States (venue does not contain 'usa')
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS outside_us FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND lower(venue) NOT LIKE '%usa%';
- Result:
  outside_us: 6

4) List which editions were counted as outside the US
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, venue FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND lower(venue) NOT LIKE '%usa%' ORDER BY year;
- Result rows:

  - 2003 — barsebäck golf & country club , sweden
  - 2007 — halmstad gk , sweden
  - 2011 — killeen castle golf resort , ireland

Conclusion:
- Outside-US hostings from 1990–2013: 6
- The claim of 7 occasions is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Year range interpreted as inclusive (1990 through 2013).
- “Outside the US” determined by venue text not containing the substring “usa” (case-insensitive), which aligns with how US venues are recorded in this dataset.
