Conclusion: Supported by the data. In our available awards dataset (public.nickelodeon_movies), Susan Sarandon is recorded as a winner in 2001.

Evidence from data:
- Matching record shows she won “Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie” in 2001 for Rugrats in Paris: The Movie.

Executed SQL (with exact statement):
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result
FROM public.nickelodeon_movies
WHERE "winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%Susan Sarandon%'
ORDER BY year;

Result row returned:
- year: 2001
- category: favorite voice from an animated movie
- film: rugrats in paris : the movie
- winner / nominee (s): susan sarandon
- result: won

Interpretation:
- “result: won” indicates she was the winner (not merely a nominee) in 2001 within this dataset.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the accessible dataset (Nickelodeon movies/awards). The phrasing “winner nominee” is taken to mean whether she was a winner or nominee in 2001; the dataset shows she was a winner.
