Summary
- Claim assessed: “the call sign for the radio owned by Bell Media is CKFR.”
- Data source explored: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact) → public.media_in_kelowna

Data source and schema
- Table: public.media_in_kelowna
  - Columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text)

Evidence 1: Which stations are owned by Bell Media?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%Bell Media%';
- Result:
  - chsu - fm — bell media
  - cilk - fm — bell media
- Finding: The Bell Media-owned stations listed in this dataset are CHSU-FM and CILK-FM.

Evidence 2: Ownership of CKFR
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT frequency, "call sign" AS call_sign, branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
- Relevant returned rows (excerpt):
  - 1150 am | ckfr | am 1150 | news / talk | astral media
  - 00 99.9 fm | chsu - fm | 99.9 sun fm | contemporary hits radio | bell media
  - 0 101.5 fm | cilk - fm | 101.5 ez rock | adult contemporary | bell media
- Finding: CKFR (1150 AM) is listed with owner “astral media,” not Bell Media, in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The data shows that Bell Media’s stations (in this table) are CHSU-FM and CILK-FM. CKFR is associated with Astral Media. Therefore, the claim that the call sign for the radio owned by Bell Media is CKFR is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “radio owned by Bell Media” within the scope of the available dataset (media_in_kelowna), which appears to catalog Kelowna radio stations.
- Used a case-insensitive substring match (ILIKE '%Bell Media%') to identify ownership variations in capitalization.
- Treated the provided database as authoritative for verification, as instructed.
