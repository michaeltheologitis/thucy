Claim to verify: “The date of vacancy, when the position in the table is 10th and the manner of departure is resign, is 28 February 2011.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
- Columns: team; outgoing head coach; manner of departure; date of vacancy; position in table; incoming head coach; date of appointment

Evidence from the database
1) Identify the row(s) with position in table = '10th'
SQL executed:
SELECT team, "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "position in table"
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "position in table" = '10th';
Result:
- team: beira - mar | manner of departure: resigned | date of vacancy: 28 february 2011 | position in table: 10th

2) Check if any row uses the exact string 'resign' (case-sensitive) in manner of departure
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "manner of departure" = 'resign';
Result:
- match_count: 0
Interpretation: The table records the manner as “resigned” (past tense), not the exact string “resign”.

3) Directly test the combined condition using a flexible match for resign*
SQL executed:
SELECT "team", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "position in table"
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "position in table" = '10th' AND "manner of departure" ILIKE 'resign%';
Result:
- team: beira - mar | manner of departure: resigned | date of vacancy: 28 february 2011 | position in table: 10th

Assessment
- The only row with position in table = '10th' has manner of departure recorded as “resigned” and date of vacancy “28 february 2011”.
- Although the wording “resign” (present/infinitive) does not exactly match the stored value “resigned” (past tense), the substantive condition clearly aligns, and the date of vacancy is exactly 28 February 2011.

Conclusion
- The claim that the date of vacancy is 28 February 2011 under the stated conditions is supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “resign” to include the recorded value “resigned” (case-insensitive, morphological variation).
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga table discovered in the connected TabFact database.
