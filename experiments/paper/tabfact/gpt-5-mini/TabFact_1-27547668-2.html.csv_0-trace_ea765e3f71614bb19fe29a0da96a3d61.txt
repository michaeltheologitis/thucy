Claim to verify: “there be 3 episode that air in january, while only 2 air in february.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact, public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (contains TV episode titles and original air dates)
  - Columns: Unnamed: 0 (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), viewers (bigint), original airdate (text), prod code (bigint)

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows and date format
- SQL:
  SELECT "title", "original airdate" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes LIMIT 20;
- Result (partial):
  1. fathers and sons — january 6 , 2010
  2. the return of the grievous angel — january 13 , 2010
  3. duchess of george — january 20 , 2010
  4. hit and rum — february 3 , 2010
  5. the one who got away — february 10 , 2010
  6–10. five entries in march 2010
- SQL (table size check):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes;
- Result: total_rows = 10

2) Count episodes by month (based on first token of original airdate)
- SQL:
  SELECT LOWER(TRIM(SPLIT_PART("original airdate", ' ', 1))) AS month, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  GROUP BY month
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, month;
- Results:
  - march: 5
  - january: 3
  - february: 2

3) Distinct airdate values (sanity check)
- SQL:
  SELECT "original airdate", COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  GROUP BY "original airdate"
  ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST, "original airdate";
- Results include: "january 6 , 2010", "january 13 , 2010", "january 20 , 2010", "february 3 , 2010", "february 10 , 2010", and five in March 2010.

Conclusion
- The data shows 3 episodes aired in January and 2 aired in February. The claim is supported by the evidence from the episodes table.

Assumptions
- “air” refers to the column original airdate.
- The claim pertains to the entire contents of the table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (not restricted by season/year beyond what’s present).
