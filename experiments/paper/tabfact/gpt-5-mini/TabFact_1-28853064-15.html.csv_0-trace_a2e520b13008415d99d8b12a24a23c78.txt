Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that Sergio Luis Henao received both the general classification award and the points classification award (context inferred: 2010 Vuelta a Colombia, the only available dataset).

Data source discovery
- Available source: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia (2010 Vuelta a Colombia classifications). No other data sources were available.

Schema overview (from the database)
- Columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), "general classification" (text), "points classification" (text), "mountains classification" (text), "sprints classification" (text), "team classification" (text).

Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Determine the final stage (maximum stage number)
SQL:
SELECT MAX(stage) AS max_stage FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia;
Result:
- max_stage = 13

2) Retrieve general and points classifications for the final stage
SQL:
SELECT stage, "general classification", "points classification"
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia
WHERE stage = 13;
Result:
- stage: 13
- general classification: sergio luis henao

3) Context check (optional) — overview across stages
SQL:
SELECT stage, "general classification", "points classification"
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia
ORDER BY stage ASC;
Selected results (start and finish):
- Stage 1: general = sergio luis henao; points = no award
- Stages 9–13: general = sergio luis henao; points = sergio luis henao

Conclusion
- At the final stage (stage 13, the maximum stage in the table), both the general classification and the points classification are listed as “sergio luis henao.” This supports the claim that he was awarded both the general classification and the points classification in this event dataset.

Assumptions
- “Be given the ... award” is interpreted as the rider being the final (overall) winner/leader for that classification, which in this dataset corresponds to the values recorded at the maximum stage number (stage 13).
