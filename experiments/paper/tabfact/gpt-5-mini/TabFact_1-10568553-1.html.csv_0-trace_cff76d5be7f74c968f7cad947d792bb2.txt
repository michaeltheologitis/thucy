Claim interpreted: “Anne Street have no major junction in the milepost.” I interpret this as asserting that, in the available roadway dataset, the record for Anne Street indicates no major junctions in the milepost field.

Data sources explored
- Available database: postgres_tabfact17 (public schema)
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.massachusetts_route_139
  - Columns: county (text), location (text), "street names" (text), milepost (text), "roads intersected" (text), notes (text)

Evidence from data
1) Search for records where street names include “Anne Street” (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected"
  FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
  WHERE "street names" ILIKE '%Anne Street%';
- Result (1 row):
  - county: norfolk
  - location: weymouth
  - street names: anne street
  - milepost: (no major junctions)
  - roads intersected: (no major junctions)

2) Check for potential abbreviations “Anne St” or “Anne St.” (case-insensitive) to ensure no conflicting entries
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
  WHERE "street names" ~* '\\mAnne St\\.?\\M';
- Result: match_count = 0
- Executed SQL (detail retrieval with same predicate):
  SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected"
  FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
  WHERE "street names" ~* '\\mAnne St\\.?\\M';
- Result: No rows returned

Assessment
- The sole record for “anne street” in the massachusetts_route_139 table explicitly lists the milepost value as “(no major junctions).” The “roads intersected” field also reads “(no major junctions),” reinforcing the absence of major junctions. No abbreviation variants were found that might contradict this. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the available dataset (public.massachusetts_route_139). No other datasets were accessible.
- “Major junction” is taken as represented in the dataset text values; specifically, the entry “(no major junctions)” in the milepost field is interpreted to mean there are no major junctions associated with that record.
- The claim pertains to the “Anne Street” entry found in this table, not to all possible Anne Streets elsewhere.
