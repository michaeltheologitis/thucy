Claim to verify:
"part number lf80537 gf0411 m with fsb 533 mt / s have frequency 2 ghz and sspec number sla4h (m0)"

Step 1 — Identify the part number “lf80537 gf0411 m” in the data
Evidence query and result:
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "fsb", "frequency", "part number (s)" 
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "part number (s)" ILIKE '%LF80537%' AND "part number (s)" ILIKE '%GF0411%';

Result:
- model number: pentium dual - core t3200
- sspec number: slavg (m0)
- fsb: 667 mt / s
- frequency: 2 ghz
- part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m

Interpretation:
- The part number lf80537 gf0411 m corresponds to Pentium Dual-Core T3200.
- For this part number, the dataset shows: frequency 2 GHz, FSB 667 MT/s, sSpec SLAVG (M0).

Step 2 — Check which CPU has sSpec “SLA4H”
Evidence query and result:
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "frequency", "fsb", "part number (s)", "sspec number"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "sspec number" ILIKE '%SLA4H%';

Result:
- model number: pentium dual - core t2390
  frequency: 1.87 ghz
  fsb: 533 mt / s
  part number (s): lf80537 ge0361 m
  sspec number: sla4h (m0)

Interpretation:
- The sSpec SLA4H (M0) belongs to the Pentium Dual-Core T2390, which has 1.87 GHz frequency and 533 MT/s FSB, with part number lf80537 ge0361 m — not lf80537 gf0411 m.

Step 3 — Cross-check the sSpec for lf80537 gf0411 m
Evidence query and result:
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "frequency", "fsb", "part number (s)", "sspec number"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "sspec number" ILIKE '%SLAVG%';

Result:
- model number: pentium dual - core t3200
- frequency: 2 ghz
- fsb: 667 mt / s
- part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m
- sspec number: slavg (m0)

Conclusion:
- True: The part number lf80537 gf0411 m has frequency 2 GHz.
- False: It does not have FSB 533 MT/s (it has 667 MT/s per the data).
- False: Its sSpec is not SLA4H (M0); it is SLAVG (M0). SLA4H (M0) corresponds to a different processor (T2390) with part number lf80537 ge0361 m and 533 MT/s FSB at 1.87 GHz.

Overall, the claim combines correct details (2 GHz) of the T3200 with the FSB and sSpec of the T2390.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to Intel Pentium Dual-Core mobile processors listed in the table “public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors”.
- Matching for part numbers and sSpec values was done case-insensitively and by substring where appropriate.
- “FSB 533 MT/s” is interpreted as the value in the “fsb” column of the dataset.
