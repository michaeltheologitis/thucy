Claim to verify
“The geo id for a township with 0.717 square mile of water is 3806741020.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table discovered: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
  Columns: "township" (text), "county" (text), "pop (2010)" (bigint), "land ( sqmi )" (double precision), "water (sqmi)" (double precision), "latitude" (double precision), "longitude" (text), "geo id" (bigint), "ansi code" (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check for any township with water area exactly 0.717 sq mi
SQL executed:
SELECT "township", "county", "water (sqmi)", "geo id"
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE "water (sqmi)" = 0.717
ORDER BY "township";
Result: 0 rows returned.

2) Check for any township with water area approximately 0.717 sq mi (between 0.716 and 0.718)
SQL executed:
SELECT "township", "county", "water (sqmi)", "geo id"
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE "water (sqmi)" BETWEEN 0.716 AND 0.718
ORDER BY "water (sqmi)" DESC, "township";
Result: 0 rows returned.

3) Find the township closest to 0.717 sq mi of water and inspect its geo id
SQL executed:
SELECT "township", "county", "water (sqmi)", "geo id", ABS("water (sqmi)" - 0.717) AS diff
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
ORDER BY diff
LIMIT 10;
Top result returned:
- township: joliette | county: pembina | water (sqmi): 0.771 | geo id: 3806741020 | diff: 0.054

4) Retrieve the record for geo id 3806741020
SQL executed:
SELECT "township", "county", "water (sqmi)", "geo id"
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE "geo id" = 3806741020;
Result:
- township: joliette | county: pembina | water (sqmi): 0.771 | geo id: 3806741020

Conclusion
- The database contains no township with exactly (or within 0.001–0.002 tolerance) 0.717 sq mi of water.
- The specific geo id 3806741020 corresponds to Joliette Township, Pembina County, with 0.771 sq mi of water, not 0.717.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to North Dakota townships, consistent with the available table and the state code “38” in the provided geo id.
- The “geo id” column represents the authoritative geographic identifier for these townships in this dataset.
- Water areas are taken as stored double-precision values in “water (sqmi)”.
