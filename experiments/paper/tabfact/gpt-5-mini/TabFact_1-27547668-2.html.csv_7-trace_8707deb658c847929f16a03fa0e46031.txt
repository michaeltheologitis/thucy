Claim to verify: "there be 2 episode in the series that be direct by perry chafe"

What I checked
- Identified the only available TV-episodes dataset in the connected data sources: a table of Republic of Doyle episodes including a "directed by" column.
- Searched for any episodes whose director field contains Perry Chafe (including variations like any occurrence of "perry" or "chafe").

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  - Columns include: title (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), viewers (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "prod code" (bigint)

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Count episodes directed by Perry Chafe (case-insensitive exact name substring)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%perry chafe%';
Result:
[{"count": 0}]

2) List episode titles that match the above (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT ARRAY_AGG(title) AS titles FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%perry chafe%';
Result:
[{"titles": null}]

3) Broader variation check in "directed by" for any occurrence of 'perry' or 'chafe'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%perry%' OR lower("directed by") LIKE '%chafe%';
Result:
match_count = 0

SQL:
SELECT COALESCE(array_agg(DISTINCT "directed by"), ARRAY[]::text[]) AS matches FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%perry%' OR lower("directed by") LIKE '%chafe%';
Result:
matches = []

Context (not part of the claim, but helps explain possible confusion)
- Perry Chafe appears in the "written by" field for some episodes, confirming the person is in this series' credits but as a writer, not a director in this dataset.
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "written by" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%perry%' OR "written by" ILIKE '%chafe%';
Results include:
- allan hawco , perry chafe and malcolm macrury
- perry chafe

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%perry%' OR "written by" ILIKE '%chafe%';
Result:
- episode_count: 3

Conclusion
- The table of Republic of Doyle episodes shows zero episodes directed by Perry Chafe. Therefore, the claim that there are 2 episodes in the series directed by Perry Chafe is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "the series" refers to Republic of Doyle, as it is the only TV-episode series data available in the connected data sources.
- Case-insensitive substring matching was used to catch potential formatting variations (e.g., "Perry J. Chafe"). No matches were found even with broader "perry" or "chafe" search.
- The connected data source is treated as authoritative within its scope, per instructions.
