Claim interpreted: “All of the translators are Class D.” Data source used: TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema, table public.whlp (columns: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Count total rows
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM public.whlp;
- Result: total_rows = 6

2) Count rows with class = 'D' (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS class_d_count FROM public.whlp WHERE lower("class") = 'd';
- Result: class_d_count = 6

3) Count rows where class IS NULL
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS class_null_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "class" IS NULL;
- Result: class_null_count = 0

4) Count rows where class IS NOT 'D' (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS class_not_d_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "class" IS NOT NULL AND lower("class") <> 'd';
- Result: class_not_d_count = 0

5) Distribution of class values
- SQL:
  SELECT "class", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.whlp
  GROUP BY "class"
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result: class = d, count = 6

Conclusion: All 6 rows in public.whlp have class = 'd', with no NULLs and no non-'d' values. This directly supports the claim that all of the translators are Class D.

Assumptions:
- “translator” refers to the entries represented in the public.whlp table.
- Class comparison is intended to be case-insensitive (handled via lower(class) = 'd').
