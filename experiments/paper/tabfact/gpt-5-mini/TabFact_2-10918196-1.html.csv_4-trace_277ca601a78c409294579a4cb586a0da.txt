Claim: The New York Jets had 992 more in crowd attendance in their second 1993 game against the Miami Dolphins than in their first.

Evidence from data
- Data source: postgres_tabfact31 (TabFact), table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season

1) Identify the two 1993 Jets vs. Dolphins games and their attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Dolphins%'
ORDER BY week ASC;
Results (ordered by week):
- Week 2 | Date: 1993 - 09 - 12 | Opponent: miami dolphins | Game site: joe robbie stadium | Attendance: 70314
- Week 10 | Date: 1993 - 11 - 07 | Opponent: miami dolphins | Game site: the meadowlands | Attendance: 71306

2) Compute the attendance difference (second minus first)
Executed SQL:
SELECT (array_agg(attendance ORDER BY week))[1] AS first_attendance,
       (array_agg(attendance ORDER BY week))[2] AS second_attendance,
       ((array_agg(attendance ORDER BY week))[2] - (array_agg(attendance ORDER BY week))[1]) AS second_minus_first
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Dolphins%';
Result:
- first_attendance: 70314
- second_attendance: 71306
- second_minus_first: 992

Conclusion
- The second game’s attendance (71,306) exceeds the first game’s attendance (70,314) by 992, exactly matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “First” and “second” games are determined by the chronological order within the 1993 season (ordered by week).
- Opponent matching uses case-insensitive substring match on 'Dolphins' in the opponent field.
