- Interpreted claim: The game recorded with a score of 4 - 1 should instead have a result of 2 - 1 and the venue should be London, England.

- Available data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23) database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.kwak_tae_hwi with columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text).

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Inspect all rows
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi;
Results (date | venue | score | result | competition):
- february 2 , 2008 | seoul , south korea | 1 - 0 | 4 - 0 | 2010 world cup qualification
- february 17 , 2008 | chongqing , china | 3 - 2 | 3 - 2 | 2008 east asian cup

- march 3 , 2010 | london , england | 2 - 0 | 2 - 0 | friendly
- june 8 , 2012 | doha , qatar | 2 - 1 | 4 - 1 | 2014 world cup qualification

2) Find the game(s) with score = '4 - 1'
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '4 - 1';
Result:
- october 15 , 2008 | seoul , south korea | 4 - 1 | 4 - 1 | 2010 world cup qualification

3) Check if any game has result = '2 - 1'
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '2 - 1';
Result: 0 rows (no matches)

4) Check games at venue = 'london , england'
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue = 'london , england';
Result:
- march 3 , 2010 | london , england | 2 - 0 | 2 - 0 | friendly

Assessment
- The only game with score 4 - 1 took place in Seoul, South Korea, and its recorded result is 4 - 1, not 2 - 1.
- No game in the table has a result of 2 - 1.
- The only game in London, England has a 2 - 0 score/result, not 4 - 1.
- Therefore, the claim that the game with a 4 - 1 score should have result 2 - 1 and venue London, England is not supported and contradicts the data.

Assumptions
- I interpret “the game with a 4 - 1 score” as the row where the score column equals the literal string '4 - 1'.
- I interpret the claim as asserting the correct result should be '2 - 1' and the correct venue should be 'london , england' for that same game.
