Claim to verify
- “the toronto blue jay win 2 of the last 3 game they play in may 1991.” Interpreted as: Did the Toronto Blue Jays win 2 of their final 3 games played in May 1991?

What I checked
- Pulled all May 1991 games from the Toronto Blue Jays 1991 season table, then examined the last three May dates and whether each was a win or loss based on the change in the cumulative wins (“record”) after each game.

Evidence from the database (with executed SQL)
1) List all May 1991 games (date, opponent, score, loss, record) and order by the day of the month
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'may %'
ORDER BY CAST(regexp_replace(date, '\\D', '', 'g') AS integer);

Returned rows (end of list shown here for the last dates in May):
- may 28 | athletics | 8 - 4 | acker (1 - 2)     | 25 - 20
- may 29 | athletics | 8 - 3 | slusarski (1 - 2) | 26 - 20
- may 30 | athletics | 8 - 6 | ward (0 - 2)      | 26 - 21
- may 31 | angels    | 5 - 1 | langston (6 - 2)  | 27 - 21

How wins/losses are represented (confirmation via SQL)
2) Verified that the left number in “score” is the winner’s runs and used the change in the “record” (wins) to mark Blue Jays wins
SQL executed:
SELECT date, score,
  (regexp_match(score, '^\\s*([0-9]+)'))[1]::int AS first_runs,
  (regexp_match(score, '-\\s*([0-9]+)'))[1]::int AS second_runs,
  CAST(split_part(record,' - ',1) AS integer) AS wins,
  LAG(CAST(split_part(record,' - ',1) AS integer)) OVER (ORDER BY CAST(regexp_replace(date,'\\D','', 'g') AS integer)) AS prev_wins,
  (CAST(split_part(record,' - ',1) AS integer) > LAG(CAST(split_part(record,' - ',1) AS integer)) OVER (ORDER BY CAST(regexp_replace(date,'\\D','', 'g') AS integer))) AS game_marked_as_win,
  ((regexp_match(score, '^\\s*([0-9]+)'))[1]::int > (regexp_match(score, '-\\s*([0-9]+)'))[1]::int) AS first_greater_than_second
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'may %'
ORDER BY CAST(regexp_replace(date,'\\D','', 'g') AS integer);

Key interpretation supported by this query:
- The left side of “score” is always the winner’s runs (first_greater_than_second = true).
- A Blue Jays win is identified when the wins count in “record” increases versus the previous game (game_marked_as_win = true).

Applying this to the last three May games
- May 29: score 8–3, record moved 25–20 → 26–20 → Win for Toronto.
- May 30: score 8–6, record moved 26–20 → 26–21 → Loss for Toronto.
- May 31: score 5–1, record moved 26–21 → 27–21 → Win for Toronto.

Conclusion
- The Blue Jays won 2 of their last 3 games in May 1991 (W-L-W on May 29, 30, 31).

Assumptions made
- “Last 3 game they play in May 1991” means the final three calendar games in May (May 29, 30, 31, 1991).
- The “record” field is the cumulative season record after each game and can be used to detect wins via an increase in wins count.
