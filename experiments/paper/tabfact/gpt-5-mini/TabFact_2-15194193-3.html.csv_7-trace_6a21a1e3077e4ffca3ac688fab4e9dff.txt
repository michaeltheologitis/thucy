Claim to verify: “1971 be the only year alberto pagani win 2 time in the same year, in the 250cc class.”

Data source discovery
- Tool used: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One accessible PostgreSQL source (TabFact) with a public schema.

Schema exploration
- Tool used: schema_query
- Relevant table found: alberto_pagani
  - Columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify available classes
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT class FROM alberto_pagani ORDER BY class;
Result:
- 125cc, 250cc, 350cc, 500cc, 50cc

2) Retrieve all 250cc seasons for Alberto Pagani (year, wins)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, class, wins, team, points FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' ORDER BY year;
Result (year: wins):
- 1960: 0
- 1961: 0
- 1962: 0
- 1964: 0
- 1965: 0
- 1966: 0
- 1967: 0
- 1970: 0
- 1971: 0

3) Check for any 250cc year with exactly 2 wins
SQL executed:
SELECT year, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' AND wins = 2 ORDER BY year;
Result: No rows returned (no 250cc year with exactly 2 wins)

4) Check for any 250cc year with 2 or more wins
SQL executed:
SELECT year, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' AND wins >= 2 ORDER BY year;
Result: No rows returned (no 250cc year with 2 or more wins)

Conclusion
- The table shows Alberto Pagani recorded 0 wins in every listed 250cc season, including 1971.
- Therefore, the claim that 1971 was the only year he won twice in the 250cc class is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Win 2 time in the same year” is interpreted as the season tally (wins = 2) in the 250cc class for that year.
- Class matching used the exact text value '250cc' as present in the data.
- The alberto_pagani table is treated as the authoritative record for his class-by-year results, per the data-grounding instructions.
