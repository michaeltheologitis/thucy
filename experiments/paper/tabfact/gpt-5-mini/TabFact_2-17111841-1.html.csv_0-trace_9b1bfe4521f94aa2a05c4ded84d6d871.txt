Summary
Claim: “episode 4 be the earliest episode number that originally air on June 8, 2008.”
Finding: Supported by the data. The only episode with an original airdate corresponding to June 8, 2008 in the available dataset is episode 4; therefore, the earliest episode number on that date is 4.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: "episode" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "timeslot (approx)" (text), "viewers (millions)" (double precision), "nightly rank" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Broad search for any representation of June 8, 2008 within the "original airdate" text, returning matching episodes
SQL:
SELECT "episode", "original airdate"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original airdate" ~* '(?:june\s*8(?:th)?(?:,)?\s*2008|8(?:th)?\s*june(?:,)?\s*2008|2008[-/.]06[-/.]08|0?6[-/.]0?8[-/.]2008|0?6/0?8/2008|06/08/2008|6/8/2008|20080608)'
ORDER BY "episode" ASC;
Result:
- episode: 4, original airdate: 8 june 2008

2) Compute the minimum episode number among rows whose original airdate corresponds to June 8, 2008 (matching common textual/numeric formats)
SQL:
SELECT min(episode) AS min_episode FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE
lower("original airdate") LIKE '%june 8, 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%jun 8, 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%june 8 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%jun 8 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%8 june 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%8 jun 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%8th june 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%8th jun 2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%2008-06-08%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%2008/06/08%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%06/08/2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%6/8/2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%8/6/2008%'
OR lower("original airdate") LIKE '%08/06/2008%';
Result:
- min_episode: 4

Conclusion
- Only episode 4 appears with an original airdate corresponding to June 8, 2008 in the dataset, and the computed minimum episode number for that date is 4. Therefore, the claim is verified by the data.

Assumptions
- The "episode" column represents the episode number.
- "original airdate" is stored as text and may appear in multiple formats; regex and LIKE patterns were used to capture common representations of June 8, 2008 (e.g., “8 June 2008,” “June 8, 2008,” “2008-06-08,” etc.).
- The public.my_info_table is the authoritative source for episode and airdate information within the available data environment.
