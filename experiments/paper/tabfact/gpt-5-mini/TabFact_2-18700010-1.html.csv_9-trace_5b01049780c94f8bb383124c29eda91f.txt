Claim interpreted: “Two other players apart from Peter Hart have FA Cup goals.” I verified this against the available dataset: TabFact → public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season.

Summary of findings
- The dataset shows only one player with any FA Cup goals: Peter Hart (1 goal).
- Excluding Peter Hart, there are zero players with FA Cup goals.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) List all players who scored FA Cup goals
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "fa cup goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" IS NOT NULL AND "fa cup goals" > 0 ORDER BY name;
Result:
- name: peter hart, fa cup goals: 1

2) Count of players with FA Cup goals
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_scorers FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" IS NOT NULL AND "fa cup goals" > 0;
Result:
- total_scorers: 1

3) Count of players with FA Cup goals excluding Peter Hart
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS scorers_excluding_peter_hart FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" IS NOT NULL AND "fa cup goals" > 0 AND name <> 'peter hart';
Result:
- scorers_excluding_peter_hart: 0

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in this table. There are not two other players with FA Cup goals besides Peter Hart; there are none.

Assumptions
- Scope: I assumed the claim pertains to the available dataset (Huddersfield Town F.C. 1979–80 season squad stats) since no broader data sources were accessible.
- Definition: “Have FA Cup goal” interpreted as "fa cup goals" > 0 in this table.
- Name matching: Used the stored name value "peter hart" as returned by the dataset.
