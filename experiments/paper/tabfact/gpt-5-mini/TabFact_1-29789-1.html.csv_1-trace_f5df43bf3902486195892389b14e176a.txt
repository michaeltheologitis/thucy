Claim to verify: “In the UNWTO region of Asia, there were 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012, which was less than in 2011.”

What the data shows
- The available dataset (public.tourism) is country-level and includes a UNWTO region classification per country. It does not provide region-level aggregates. The only row labeled with UNWTO region = asia is for China.
- For China (UNWTO region: asia), international tourist arrivals were 57.7 million in 2012 and 57.6 million in 2011. Therefore, 2012 was slightly higher than 2011, not less.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct UNWTO regions and their row counts
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "unwto region", COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.tourism
  GROUP BY "unwto region"
  ORDER BY row_count DESC;
- Result summary:
  - europe: 7
  - north america: 1
  - asia: 1
  (This shows there is exactly one row tagged as asia.)

2) Details for the row where UNWTO region = 'asia'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT country, "international tourist arrivals (2012)", "international tourist arrivals (2011)"
  FROM public.tourism
  WHERE "unwto region" = 'asia';
- Result:
  - country: china
    international tourist arrivals (2012): 57.7 million
    international tourist arrivals (2011): 57.6 million
  (2012 > 2011, not less.)

3) Full table context (top destinations by rank)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT rank, country, "unwto region", "international tourist arrivals (2012)", "international tourist arrivals (2011)" FROM public.tourism ORDER BY rank;
- Result excerpt (rank | country | unwto region | 2012 | 2011):
  1 | france | europe | 83.0 million | 81.6 million
  2 | united states | north america | 67.0 million | 62.7 million
  3 | china | asia | 57.7 million | 57.6 million
  4 | spain | europe | 57.7 million | 56.2 million
  ...
  (Confirms the 57.7 million figure is for China, a country in the UNWTO region asia.)

Conclusion
- The statement that 2012 was “less than 2011” is contradicted by the data: for China (the only entry under UNWTO region asia in this dataset), 57.7 million (2012) is higher than 57.6 million (2011).
- Additionally, the 57.7 million figure in the dataset refers to China specifically, not to the entire Asia region. The table does not provide a region-wide total for Asia.

Assumptions made
- “UNWTO region of Asia” was interpreted using the table’s "unwto region" column, which classifies countries by region; the dataset does not include regional aggregates.
- Exact string matching was used for 'asia' as stored in the table.
