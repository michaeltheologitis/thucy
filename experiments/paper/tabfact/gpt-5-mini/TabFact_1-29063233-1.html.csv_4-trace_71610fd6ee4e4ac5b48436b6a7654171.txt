Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single table in the public schema: merlin_series_2, which includes columns for episode title and UK viewers (million).

Evidence query (exact SQL executed):
SELECT title, "uk viewers (million)" FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE title ILIKE '%Beauty and the Beast%';

Results returned by the query:
- Part 1: title = "beauty and the beast (part 1)", UK viewers (million) = 5.53
- Part 2: title = "beauty and the beast (part 2)", UK viewers (million) = 6.14

Assessment:
- 6.14 million (Part 2) > 5.53 million (Part 1). Therefore, Part 2 had more UK viewers than Part 1 according to the dataset.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted within the available dataset as referring to the Merlin Series 2 two-part episodes titled "beauty and the beast (part 1)" and "beauty and the beast (part 2)" in the merlin_series_2 table.
