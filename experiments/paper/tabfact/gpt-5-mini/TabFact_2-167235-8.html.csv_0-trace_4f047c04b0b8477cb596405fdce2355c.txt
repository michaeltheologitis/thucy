Claim to verify: “the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible data sources discovered: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) is reachable and exposes at least the public schema (owner: guest_user). Table-level metadata is present in that schema. No other databases, external APIs, or file-based data sources were found or were accessible during this survey.

Schema inspection
- Matching table identified: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  - Columns: name; born - died; term start; term end; political party
  - Rationale: Contains Albania prime ministers with a 'term start' column needed for comparison.

Evidence retrieval and executed SQL
1) Retrieve raw term start values for both individuals
SQL:
SELECT name, "term start" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Fino%' OR name ILIKE '%Ahmeti%';
Returned rows:
- name: vilson ahmeti, term start: 10 december 1991
- name: bashkim fino, term start: 11 march 1997

2) Parse the term start values to dates for precise comparison
SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", to_date("term start", 'DD MONTH YYYY') AS dt FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Fino%' OR name ILIKE '%Ahmeti%';
Returned rows:
- name: vilson ahmeti, term start: 10 december 1991, dt: 1991-12-10
- name: bashkim fino, term start: 11 march 1997, dt: 1997-03-11

Analysis
- Comparing the parsed dates shows that Bashkim Fino’s term started on 1997-03-11, which is after Vilson Ahmeti’s term start on 1991-12-10.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data. Bashkim Fino’s term start is after Vilson Ahmeti’s term start.

Assumptions
- The 'term start' column in the identified table represents the start date of the listed prime minister’s term and is the relevant date for comparison.
- Names were matched case-insensitively using partial matches ('%Fino%' and '%Ahmeti%'), and the returned rows correspond uniquely to Bashkim Fino and Vilson Ahmeti.
- The textual date format in the table is interpreted as 'DD MONTH YYYY' for parsing.
