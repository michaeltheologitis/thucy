Claim to verify
- “The city of license for W282AE is Albany, Georgia, and the city of license for W290AG is Gadsden, Alabama.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered data source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.wyfk
  - Columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (text), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text)

Evidence collected
1) Inspect table contents to see available call signs and cities of license
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk;
- Returned rows (excerpt relevant to this claim):
  - w282ae | macon , georgia
  - w290ag | griffin , georgia

2) Directly fetch the two specified call signs (case-insensitive match)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w282ae','w290ag');
- Results:
  - call sign: w282ae, city of license: macon , georgia
  - call sign: w290ag, city of license: griffin , georgia

3) Context check: which records have Albany or Gadsden as city of license
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("city of license") LIKE '%albany%' OR lower("city of license") LIKE '%gadsden%';
- Results:
  - w230av — gadsden , alabama
  - w273ae — albany , georgia

Findings
- W282AE is listed with city of license “macon , georgia,” not Albany, Georgia.
- W290AG is listed with city of license “griffin , georgia,” not Gadsden, Alabama.
- Albany, Georgia and Gadsden, Alabama do appear in the dataset, but for different call signs (w273ae and w230av, respectively).

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the authoritative source available.

Assumptions
- Call signs in the database are stored lowercase; queries used lower(...) to match provided uppercase inputs.
- City names and punctuation are reported exactly as stored (e.g., spacing before commas).
