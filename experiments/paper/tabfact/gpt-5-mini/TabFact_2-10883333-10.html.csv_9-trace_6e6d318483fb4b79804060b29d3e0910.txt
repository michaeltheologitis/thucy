Summary
- I explored the available data sources and found one relevant table: public.t_1975_vfl_season in the TabFact-backed PostgreSQL instance. This table includes venue (stadium) and crowd (attendance) fields for games in the 1975 VFL season.
- I verified the exact venue names present (“moorabbin oval” and “kardinia park”) and compared attendance statistics for those venues based on the available rows.
- In this dataset, Moorabbin Oval’s crowd is higher than Kardinia Park’s, contradicting the claim that Moorabbin Oval has less crowd than Kardinia Park.

Evidence and exact SQL queries
1) Identify available venue names
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season ORDER BY venue;
Results:
- junction oval
- kardinia park
- mcg
- moorabbin oval
- princes park
- vfl park

Confirmation queries (case-insensitive checks):
SQL (Moorabbin):
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Moorabbin%' ORDER BY venue;
Result:
- moorabbin oval

SQL (Kardinia):
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Kardinia%' ORDER BY venue;
Result:
- kardinia park

2) Compare attendance (“crowd”) between Moorabbin Oval and Kardinia Park
SQL:
SELECT lower(venue) AS venue, COUNT(*) AS num_games, SUM(crowd) AS total_attendance, AVG(crowd) AS avg_attendance, MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) IN ('moorabbin oval','kardinia park')
GROUP BY lower(venue)
ORDER BY venue;
Results:
- venue: kardinia park | num_games: 1 | total_attendance: 13328 | avg_attendance: 13328.0 | min_crowd: 13328 | max_crowd: 13328
- venue: moorabbin oval | num_games: 1 | total_attendance: 17811 | avg_attendance: 17811.0 | min_crowd: 17811 | max_crowd: 17811

3) Context: venue-level game counts and averages in the table
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS games, ROUND(AVG(crowd),2) AS avg_crowd
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY games DESC, venue;
Results:
- junction oval — 1 — 16249.00
- kardinia park — 1 — 13328.00
- mcg — 1 — 49469.00
- moorabbin oval — 1 — 17811.00
- princes park — 1 — 23830.00
- vfl park — 1 — 14056.00

Conclusion
- In the available 1975 VFL season data, the recorded crowd at Moorabbin Oval (17,811) is greater than at Kardinia Park (13,328). Thus, the claim that “moorabbin oval have less crowd than kardinia park” is contradicted by the evidence in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Crowd” is interpreted as match attendance (the ‘crowd’ column) rather than stadium capacity, because no capacity data is available in the accessible dataset.
- The comparison is based solely on the rows present in public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL season) and exact venue strings found there.
- Venue names are matched case-insensitively but reported as stored (lowercase).
