Data source consulted: TabFact (postgres_tabfact30) → public.t_1969_vfl_season

What I checked
- Whether any 1969 VFL match played at Princes Park had a home-team score of exactly 21.18 (144).
- What matches in 1969 were played at Princes Park and their scores.
- Whether the score 21.18 (144) occurred for any home team in 1969 (regardless of venue).

Evidence and exact SQL
1) Identify venue naming used in the dataset:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%prince%';
Result: princes park

2) Check for any Princes Park match with home team score = '21.18 (144)':
SQL:
SELECT "home team","away team","home team score","away team score","venue","date","crowd"
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) = 'princes park' AND "home team score" = '21.18 (144)';
Result: 0 rows

3) Confirm absence with a count:
SQL:
SELECT count(*)
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) = 'princes park' AND "home team score" = '21.18 (144)';
Result: count = 0

4) List all 1969 matches at Princes Park to show actual scores:
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", "date"
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE "venue" ILIKE '%Princes Park%'
ORDER BY "date";
Result:
- 23 august 1969 — carlton 20.7 (127) def by richmond 24.12 (156)

5) Find any occurrence of a home score equal to '21.18 (144)' in 1969, regardless of venue:
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '21.18 (144)';
Result:
- st kilda 21.18 (144) vs north melbourne 8.10 (58), venue: moorabbin oval, crowd: 11109, date: 23 august 1969

6) Check if either team scored 21.18 (144) at Princes Park:
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE venue = 'Princes Park'
  AND ("home team score" = '21.18 (144)' OR "away team score" = '21.18 (144)');
Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion
- In the 1969 VFL season (the available data), there were no matches at Princes Park where the home team scored 21.18 (144). The only Princes Park match recorded shows the home team (Carlton) scoring 20.7 (127).
- The home score 21.18 (144) did occur in 1969, but at Moorabbin Oval (St Kilda vs North Melbourne), not at Princes Park.

Verdict: Inaccurate

Assumptions
- “When the VFL play at Prince(s) Park” is interpreted as club matches from the 1969 VFL season recorded in the available table. If a different season or representative match was intended, it is not present in the accessible data.
- Score matching required exact text equality to '21.18 (144)'.
