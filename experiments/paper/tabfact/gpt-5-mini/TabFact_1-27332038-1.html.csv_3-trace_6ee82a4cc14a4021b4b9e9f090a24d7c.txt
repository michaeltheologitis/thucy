Claim: The episode with the production code 2ARG24 originally aired on May 18, 2011.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.modern_family_season_2
  - Columns: "no in series", "no in season", title, "directed by", "written by", "original air date" (text), "production code" (text), "us viewers (millions)".

Evidence queries and results:
1) Query to locate by production code (case-insensitive search):
SQL:
SELECT "no in season", title, "production code", "original air date" 
FROM public.modern_family_season_2
WHERE "production code" ILIKE '%2ARG24%';
Result:
- no in season: 23
- title: see you next fall
- production code: 2arg24
- original air date: may 18 , 2011

2) Query to confirm exact match (case-insensitive equality):
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "production code", "original air date"
FROM public.modern_family_season_2
WHERE lower(trim("production code")) = '2arg24';
Result:
- no in series: 47
- no in season: 23
- title: see you next fall
- production code: 2arg24
- original air date: may 18 , 2011

Assessment:
- The episode with production code 2ARG24 (stored as "2arg24") has an "original air date" of "may 18 , 2011" in the dataset. This matches the claimed date (differences are only in capitalization/spacing), so the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Production code matching is case-insensitive.
- The "original air date" text field reflects the authoritative original air date for the episode in this dataset (Modern Family, Season 2).
