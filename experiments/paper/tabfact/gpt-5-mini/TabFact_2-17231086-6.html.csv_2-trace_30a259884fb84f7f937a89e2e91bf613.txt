Claim being checked: "the average score for player from japan be 281"

How I interpreted the claim:
- Dataset: the available TabFact public schema, which contains a single relevant table about the 1989 U.S. Open Golf (t_1989_u_s_open_golf).
- "player from japan": rows where country = 'japan' in that table.
- "score": the numeric total embedded in the score text (e.g., "70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281"). I extract the number after '=' and average those totals.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database TabFact (public schema). Only one table present: t_1989_u_s_open_golf.

Schema examined:
- public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf(place text, player text, country text, score text, to par text, money bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify available countries to confirm how Japan is represented
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE country IS NOT NULL ORDER BY country;
Result rows:
{"country":"japan"}
{"country":"spain"}
{"country":"united states"}
{"country":"wales"}

2) List player(s) and score(s) for country = 'japan'
SQL:
SELECT player, score FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE country = 'japan';
Result:
- player: masashi ozaki; score: 70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281

3) Demonstrate numeric extraction of the total score (value after '=')
SQL:
SELECT player, score, split_part(score, '=', 2) AS after_eq, trim(split_part(score, '=', 2)) AS extracted FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE country = 'japan';
Result:
- player: masashi ozaki; score: 70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281; after_eq:  281; extracted: 281

4) Compute the average numeric score (using the extracted total)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_rows, count(trim(split_part(score, '=', 2))) AS extracted_count, avg((trim(split_part(score, '=', 2)))::numeric) AS avg_numeric_score FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE country = 'japan';
Result:
- total_rows: 1; extracted_count: 1; avg_numeric_score: 281.0

Conclusion:
- The only player from 'japan' in the dataset is Masashi Ozaki, with a total score of 281. The average score across players from Japan is therefore 281.0. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- I interpret "player from japan" to mean rows where country = 'japan' in the t_1989_u_s_open_golf table.
- I interpret "score" as the numeric total appearing after '=' in the textual score field (e.g., "... = 281"). Only totals successfully extracted as numeric are averaged.
- Verification is limited to the accessible TabFact dataset (1989 U.S. Open Golf).
