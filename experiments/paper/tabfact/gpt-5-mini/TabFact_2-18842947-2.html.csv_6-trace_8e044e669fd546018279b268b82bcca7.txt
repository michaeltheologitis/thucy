Summary
- Claim assessed: “the highest attendance figure for a game be 42,048.”
- Data source used: TabFact (postgres_tabfact20), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance).

What I checked
1) Verified the schema contains game-level attendance.
2) Queried the maximum attendance and identified the corresponding game(s).
3) Checked whether an attendance value of 42,048 appears and, if so, which game it corresponds to.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Schema inspection (via schema tool)
- Table: t_1976_detroit_lions_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)
  - No primary key reported

2) Maximum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result returned: {"max_attendance": 78042}

3) Game(s) with the maximum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season) ORDER BY week;
Result returned: {"week": 11, "date": "november 21 , 1976", "opponent": "chicago bears", "result": "w 14 - 10", "attendance": 78042}

4) Presence of 42,048 attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE attendance = 42048;
Result returned: One game found — Week 10, Date: "november 14 , 1976", Opponent: "new orleans saints", Result: "l 17 - 16", Attendance: 42048

Conclusion
- The highest attendance in the available data is 78,042 (Week 11 vs. Chicago Bears on November 21, 1976), not 42,048.
- While 42,048 does appear as an attendance figure (Week 10 vs. New Orleans Saints), it is not the maximum.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to “highest attendance” within the available dataset: the 1976 Detroit Lions season game log in the TabFact database.
- “Game” refers to any row in t_1976_detroit_lions_season, and “attendance” refers to the attendance column in that table.
