Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact. Within the public schema, a table named porphyrin is available with columns: enzyme (text), location (text), substrate (text), product (text), chromosome (text), ec (text), omim (bigint), porphyria (text).

Schema details retrieved:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: porphyrin
- Columns: enzyme, location, substrate, product, chromosome, ec, omim, porphyria

Executed SQL query and results:
SQL:
SELECT enzyme, substrate, product FROM porphyrin WHERE enzyme ILIKE '%alad%' OR enzyme ILIKE '%ala dehydratase%' OR enzyme ILIKE '%delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase%' OR enzyme ILIKE '%aminolevulinate dehydratase%' OR enzyme ILIKE '%porphobilinogen synthase%';

Result:
- enzyme: ala dehydratase
- substrate: δ - aminolevulinic acid
- product: porphobilinogen

Assessment:
- The porphyrin table directly lists the substrate for the enzyme "ala dehydratase" as "δ - aminolevulinic acid." This supports the claim that the substrate for ALA dehydratase is δ-aminolevulinic acid.

Assumptions made:
- Used a case-insensitive substring match (ILIKE) across common synonyms for the enzyme (ALAD, ALA dehydratase, delta-aminolevulinate dehydratase, aminolevulinate dehydratase, porphobilinogen synthase) to ensure comprehensive retrieval.
