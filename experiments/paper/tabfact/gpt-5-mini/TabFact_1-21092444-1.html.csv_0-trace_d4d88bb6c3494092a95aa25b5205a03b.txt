Summary
- The available database contains a table for the 1975 Army football season. Querying that table shows a game on “oct 11” versus “duke” with result “loss,” confirming that the Army Black Knights lost to Duke on October 11 of that season.

Evidence
1) Query to find Army vs. Duke entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Duke%'
ORDER BY date;

Result (rows: 1)
- date: oct 11
  opponent: duke
  result: loss
  black knights points: 10
  opponents: 21
  record: 2 - 3

Interpretation
- “Black Knights” refers to the Army Black Knights (the table name is for the 1975 Army Cadets football team; columns include “black knights points”).
- On October 11 (in the 1975 season context of this table), Army lost to Duke by a score of 10–21.

Conclusion
- The claim that “on october 11th , the black knight lose to duke” is supported by the data for the 1975 Army football season.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Assumed “Black Knight” refers to the Army Black Knights football team.
- The date “oct 11” in the table is interpreted as October 11, 1975, given the table name and seasonal context. The database available to me includes only this season’s table, so I verified the claim within that scope.
