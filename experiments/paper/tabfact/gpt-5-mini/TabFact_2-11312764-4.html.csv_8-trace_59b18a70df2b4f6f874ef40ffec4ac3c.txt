Claim: "natalia strelkova come in last place with 112.28 point"

Data sources explored
- Discovered one PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact10), schema public.
- Found a single table relevant to figure skating: public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships with columns [rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places]. No keys or relationships.

Evidence collected (with exact executed SQL)
1) Locate Natalia Strelkova’s record
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE name ILIKE '%Strelkova%';
Result:
- rank: 13
- name: natalia strelkova
- nation: soviet union
- "sp + fs": 16
- points: 164.94
- places: 134

2) Determine whether rank 13 is last place
2a) Get maximum rank and table size
SQL:
SELECT MAX(rank) AS max_rank, COUNT(*) AS total_rows, MAX("sp + fs") AS max_spfs, MAX(places) AS max_places
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
Result:
- max_rank: 31
- total_rows: 31
- max_spfs: 31
- max_places: 279

2b) Directly test if Strelkova’s rank equals max rank
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships) AS is_last
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE name ILIKE '%Strelkova%';
Result:
- rank: 13
- name: natalia strelkova
- is_last: false

3) Identify who finished last and their points, and check 112.28 points
3a) Last-place competitor
SQL:
SELECT name, points, rank
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships);
Result:
- name: gloria mas
- points: 112.28
- rank: 31

3b) Any competitor with exactly 112.28 points
SQL:
SELECT name, rank, points
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE points = 112.28;
Result:
- name: gloria mas
- rank: 31
- points: 112.28

Findings
- Natalia Strelkova did not finish last; she placed 13th with 164.94 points.
- The last-place finisher (rank 31) had 112.28 points and was Gloria Mas, not Natalia Strelkova.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. Natalia Strelkova neither finished last nor had 112.28 points; those descriptors match Gloria Mas.

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim as referring to the results captured in the available dataset (public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships). Matching on name was done case-insensitively using ILIKE.
