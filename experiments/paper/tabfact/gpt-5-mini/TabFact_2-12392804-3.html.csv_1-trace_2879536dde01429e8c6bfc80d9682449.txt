WHERE nation ILIKE '%ukraine%';
- Result:

Assumptions:
- The claim was evaluated using the only available authoritative dataset: public.t_2006_07_isu_junior_grand_prix (ISU Junior Grand Prix 2006–07 medal counts by nation). If a different competition or time frame was intended (e.g., Olympics), the result could differ, but such data was not available in the accessible sources.
