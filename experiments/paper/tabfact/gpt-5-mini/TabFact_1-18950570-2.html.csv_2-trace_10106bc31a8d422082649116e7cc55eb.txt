Claim to verify: "from 1990 - 1995, the cbr be 22.6 and the number of death per year be 1058000"

Data checks performed:
1) Confirm the period value exists
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT period FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY period;
Result excerpt:
- 1990 - 1995 (present among distinct period values)

2) Retrieve cbr and deaths per year for the specified period
Executed SQL:
SELECT cbr, "deaths per year" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '1990 - 1995';
Result:
- cbr: 22.6
- deaths per year: 1 058 000

Assessment:
- The table reports cbr = 22.6 for 1990 - 1995, matching the claim.
- The table reports deaths per year = 1 058 000 for 1990 - 1995, which equals 1,058,000, matching the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "cbr" as the cbr column (crude birth rate) and "number of death per year" as the "deaths per year" column.
- Interpreted the period string exactly as "1990 - 1995" based on the period column values.
