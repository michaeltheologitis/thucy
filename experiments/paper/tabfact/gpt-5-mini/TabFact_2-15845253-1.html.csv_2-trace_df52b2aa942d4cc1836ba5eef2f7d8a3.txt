Claim: “2 viral family have a complex virion shape.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15), schema: public
- Relevant table identified: public.viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Distinct families where virion shape contains “complex” (case-insensitive)
- Result:
  - herpesviridae — complex
  - poxviridae — complex
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT family, "virion shape"
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" IS NOT NULL
    AND LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%complex%'
  ORDER BY family;

2) Count of distinct families with virion shape described as complex
- Result: 2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS num_families
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" IS NOT NULL
    AND LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%complex%';

Conclusion:
- The data show exactly two virus families recorded with a “complex” virion shape: Herpesviridae and Poxviridae. This supports the claim that 2 viral families have a complex virion shape.

Assumptions:
- “Complex virion shape” was operationalized as any virion shape value containing the substring “complex” (case-insensitive) in the virion shape field of public.viral_disease.
- Families with NULL names (if any) would not be counted; none affected the result.
