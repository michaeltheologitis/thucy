Claim: “the melbourne tiger have the same away record as south dragon.”

Finding: Yes—within the available 2008–09 NBL season data, Melbourne Tigers and South Dragons have identical away records.

Evidence from data (TabFact, public.t_2008_09_nbl_season):
- Result excerpts:
  - melbourne tigers — away: 9 - 6
  - south dragons — away: 9 - 6
- Conclusion from results: Both teams have the same away record (9 - 6) in the 2008–09 season.

Executed SQL (as run to obtain the evidence):
SELECT team, away FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season ORDER BY team;

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted for the 2008–09 NBL season because the accessible authoritative dataset covers that season. Team names are matched case-insensitively: “melbourne tiger” → Melbourne Tigers; “south dragon” → South Dragons.
