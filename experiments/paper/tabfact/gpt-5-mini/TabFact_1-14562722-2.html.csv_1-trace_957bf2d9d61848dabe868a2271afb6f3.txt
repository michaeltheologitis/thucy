Claim to verify: “the highest number of disc release for any of the volume be only 1.”

Conclusion: Verified. The data show that the maximum number of discs associated with any volume is 1, with no rows having discs > 1.

Evidence from the database (postgres_tabfact21, schema public, table: my_info_table):

1) Maximum discs across all volumes
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(discs) AS max_discs FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result:
  max_discs = 1

2) Check for any rows with discs > 1
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_gt_1 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs > 1;
- Result:
  count_gt_1 = 0

3) Count rows with exactly one disc
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_eq_1 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs = 1;
- Result:
  count_eq_1 = 5

4) Distribution of discs values and nulls check
- SQL executed:
  SELECT discs, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM my_info_table
  GROUP BY discs
  ORDER BY count DESC, discs;
- Result:
  discs = 1, count = 5

- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count FROM my_info_table WHERE discs IS NULL;
- Result:
  null_count = 0

5) Sanity check that no volumes have discs > 1
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs > 1;
- Result:
  0 (implies the distinct list of volumes with discs > 1 is empty)

Overall interpretation:
- The maximum number of discs present for any volume in the dataset is 1, confirming the claim.

Assumptions:
- “number of disc release” is interpreted as the number of discs in a volume’s release, represented by the column discs in my_info_table.
- “volume” maps to the volume column in the same table.
- The dataset consists solely of the public.my_info_table table in the accessible data source and is treated as authoritative for this verification.
