Claim to verify: “the average of all the home team score be less than 12.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema). No other accessible sources were discovered.

Relevant schema
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
  Note: "home team score" stores values in the Australian rules football format: GOALS.BEHINDS (TOTAL POINTS), e.g., “19.14 (128)”.

Step 1 — Inspect data values
- Total rows
  Result: 6
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;

- Sample of distinct "home team score" values (all distinct values shown)
  Result: 19.14 (128); 16.14 (110); 14.7 (91); 10.13 (73); 13.12 (90); 20.8 (128)
  SQL:
  SELECT "home team score" FROM (SELECT DISTINCT "home team score" FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season) t ORDER BY random() LIMIT 20;

- Check if values are simple integers (they are not — they include goals.behinds and total in parentheses)
  Result: 0
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS integer_parse_count FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE "home team score" ~ '^\s*\d+\s*$';

Step 2 — Confirm all rows follow the expected format
- Coverage of expected format digits.digits (digits)
  Result: 6 of 6 rows match the expected format
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE 
   position('.' in trim("home team score"))>1
   AND position('(' in trim("home team score"))>position('.' in trim("home team score"))
   AND right(trim("home team score"),1)=')'
   AND substring(trim("home team score") from 1 for position('.' in trim("home team score")) - 1) ~ '^[0-9]+$'
   AND substring(trim("home team score") from position('.' in trim("home team score")) + 1 for (position('(' in trim("home team score")) - position('.' in trim("home team score")) - 2)) ~ '^[0-9]+$'
   AND substring(trim("home team score") from position('(' in trim("home team score")) + 1 for (char_length(trim("home team score")) - position('(' in trim("home team score")) - 1)) ~ '^[0-9]+$';

Step 3 — Compute averages
- Averages computed:
  • Average total points (from parentheses): 103.33
  • Average goals (before the dot): 15.33
  • Average behinds (after the dot): 11.33
  SQL (exact query executed):
  SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(substring("home team score" from '^\s*\d+\.\d+\s*\((\d+)\)')::numeric),2) AS avg_total_points,
  ROUND(AVG(substring("home team score" from '^\s*(\d+)\.\d+\s*\(\d+\)')::numeric),2) AS avg_goals,
  ROUND(AVG(substring("home team score" from '^\s*\d+\.(\d+)\s*\(\d+\)')::numeric),2) AS avg_behinds
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team score" ~ '^\s*\d+\.\d+\s*\(\d+\)$';

Assessment
- If “home team score” is interpreted as the conventional total points (the number in parentheses), the average is 103.33, which is not less than 12.
- Even if interpreted as goals, the average is 15.33, which is not less than 12.
- Only if interpreted as behinds would the average (11.33) be less than 12, but “score” typically refers to total points, not a subcomponent.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the average of all the home team score be less than 12” is not supported by the data when using the standard interpretation of score as total points.

Assumptions made
- I interpreted “home team score” as the total points value inside parentheses in the "home team score" field of public.t_1972_vfl_season.
- I considered all rows in the table (6 matches), as all rows matched the expected scoring format.
- I reported goals and behinds averages to show robustness under alternative interpretations, but used total points as the primary definition of “score.”
