Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact20 (TabFact), public schema
- Relevant table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  - Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)

Evidence
1) Count of players drafted in Round 2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_round_2 FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 2;
- Result:
  count_round_2 = 2

2) Names and picks of Round 2 selections
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, pick FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 2 ORDER BY pick;
- Result rows:
  - ray donaldson — pick: 4
  - tim foley — pick: 23

Conclusion
The claim that 5 players were picked in the 2nd round of the draft is not supported by the available data. The dataset shows only 2 players with round = 2.

Assumptions and interpretation
- The claim is interpreted against the available authoritative dataset (Indianapolis Colts draft history). The claim did not specify team or year; we therefore evaluated it across the entire table.
- “2nd round” is mapped to rows where round = 2 in the table.
