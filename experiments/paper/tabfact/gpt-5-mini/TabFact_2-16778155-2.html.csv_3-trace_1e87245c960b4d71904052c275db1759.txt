Summary conclusion: The claim is inaccurate for Week 10. In the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season data, Week 10 was against the Baltimore Ravens with attendance 54,759. The game with attendance 62,170 versus the Dallas Cowboys occurred in Week 11, not Week 10.

Evidence and executed SQL

1) What happened in Week 10?
Executed SQL query:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE week = 10;

Result:
- week: 10
- date: november 5 , 2000
- opponent: baltimore ravens
- result: l 27 - 7
- attendance: 54759

2) Is there a game with attendance = 62,170?
Query executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE attendance = 62170;

Result:
- week: 11
- date: november 12 , 2000
- opponent: dallas cowboys
- attendance: 62170

3) Cross-check any game vs. Dallas
SQL query used to obtain this result:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%dallas%'
ORDER BY week;

Result:
- Week: 11 | Date: november 12 , 2000 | Opponent: dallas cowboys | Attendance: 62170

Conclusion: For Week 10, the opponent was Baltimore Ravens and attendance was 54,759. The attendance of 62,170 against the Dallas Cowboys corresponds to Week 11, not Week 10.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the available dataset public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season (2000 Cincinnati Bengals season).
- “dallas cowboy” is interpreted as “Dallas Cowboys,” ignoring case and singular/plural, and the word “at” is treated as non-material since the opponent field does not encode home/away with an “at” prefix.
