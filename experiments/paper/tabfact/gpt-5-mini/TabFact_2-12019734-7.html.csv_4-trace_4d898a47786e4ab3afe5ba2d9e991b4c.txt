Answer: The data shows one game where Chicago was the home team and New Jersey was the visitor: February 9 (score: 4 - 5).

Evidence from the database
- Data source discovered: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29), schema: public, table: my_info_table(date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text).
- Retrieved rows matching home contains "Chicago" and visitor contains "New Jersey".

Result rows
- date: february 9 | visitor: new jersey | home: chicago | score: 4 - 5 | record: 11 - 34 - 12

Executed SQL
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE home ILIKE '%Chicago%'
  AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%'
ORDER BY date ASC;

Assumptions and notes
- "visitor" is interpreted as the away team; "home" as the host team.
- Matching used case-insensitive substring search (ILIKE) in case team names include additional words (e.g., mascots).
- The date field is stored as text and lacks a year; the ordering is lexicographic.
- Findings are limited to what is present in the single available table (my_info_table).
