Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the Chicago Bears defeated the Detroit Lions in both games they played (i.e., a season sweep). Because the only available data source covers the 1976 Detroit Lions season, I verify the claim for that season.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21), schema: public.
- Relevant table: t_1976_detroit_lions_season — game-by-game summary for the 1976 Detroit Lions (NFL).

Evidence retrieval:
- Goal: Identify all 1976 games between the Detroit Lions and the Chicago Bears and their outcomes.

Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%bears%' ORDER BY week;

Results returned:
- Week 1, September 12, 1976, chicago bears, L 10 - 3 (from Lions’ perspective)
- Week 11, November 21, 1976, chicago bears, W 14 - 10 (from Lions’ perspective)

Assessment:
- In 1976, the Lions and Bears split their two games: the Bears won in Week 1; the Lions won in Week 11. Therefore, the Bears did not defeat the Lions in both meetings that season.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available authoritative data for the 1976 season.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to a season-level head-to-head. Only the 1976 Detroit Lions season table is available, so verification is constrained to that season. Outcomes are interpreted from the Lions’ perspective as stored in the table.
