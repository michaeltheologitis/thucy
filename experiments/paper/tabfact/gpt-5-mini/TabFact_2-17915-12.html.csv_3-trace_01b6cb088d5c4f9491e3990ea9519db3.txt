Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the relevant schema.
- Queried the Lleyton Hewitt table to enumerate outcomes and compute counts.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance “TabFact” (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.lleyton_hewitt(outcome text, year bigint, championship text, surface text, opponent text, score text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Listing all rows to inspect outcomes
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
- Result (7 rows):
  • 2000, stuttgart, opponent: wayne ferreira, outcome: runner - up
  • 2002, indian wells, opponent: tim henman, outcome: winner
  • 2002, cincinnati, opponent: carlos moyá, outcome: runner - up
  • 2002, paris, opponent: marat safin, outcome: runner - up
  • 2003, indian wells (2), opponent: gustavo kuerten, outcome: winner
  • 2004, cincinnati (2), opponent: andre agassi, outcome: runner - up
  • 2005, indian wells, opponent: roger federer, outcome: runner - up

2) Distinct outcome counts
- SQL executed:
  SELECT outcome, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.lleyton_hewitt GROUP BY outcome ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result: runner - up = 5, winner = 2

3) Count of runner-up entries
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS runner_up_count FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE outcome = 'runner - up';
- Result: 5

4) Total entries in the table
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
- Result: 7

Conclusion
- The data show 5 entries labeled “runner - up” out of 7 total entries. This directly supports the claim that Lleyton Hewitt was a runner-up 5 times out of a total of 7 (within the scope of this table’s records).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the outcomes recorded in the public.lleyton_hewitt table (not Hewitt’s entire career across all events).
