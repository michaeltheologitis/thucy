Claim interpreted: “The Miami Dolphins’ defense recorded 3 shutouts during the 1983 season.” I verify this by counting 1983 games where the opponent scored 0 points.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_1983_miami_dolphins_season(week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint).

Step 1 — Inspect table contents and result format
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Key results (excerpt):
- week: 1, opponent: buffalo bills, result: w 12 - 0
- week: 12, opponent: baltimore colts, result: w 37 - 0
(Distinct results show the format is '<w|l> <team_score> - <opponent_score>'. No other rows have opponent score 0.)

Step 2 — Count shutouts (opponent points = 0)
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shutout_count
FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE result IS NOT NULL
  AND trim(split_part(result, '-', 2)) ~ '^\d+$'
  AND CAST(trim(split_part(result, '-', 2)) AS integer) = 0;
Result:
- shutout_count: 2

Step 3 — List the shutout games
Executed SQL (list):
SELECT week, opponent, result
FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE result IS NOT NULL
  AND trim(split_part(result, '-', 2)) ~ '^\d+$'
  AND CAST(trim(split_part(result, '-', 2)) AS integer) = 0
ORDER BY week;
Results:
- week: 1, opponent: buffalo bills, result: w 12 - 0
- week: 12, opponent: baltimore colts, result: w 37 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows 2 shutouts in the 1983 season, not 3. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions and scope notes
- “Shutout” is interpreted as the opponent scoring 0 points in the game, using the result field formatted as '<w|l> <team_score> - <opponent_score>'.
- The table t_1983_miami_dolphins_season contains regular-season games; no playoff games are present in this table. The verification is based on this dataset.
