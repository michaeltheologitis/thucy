Claim interpreted: In the available match-results data, there are fewer win results than loss results.

Data source discovery:
- Found a PostgreSQL data source (TabFact, public schema). A table named public.tim_lajcik records fight results with a res column indicating outcome.

Schema context (relevant table/columns):
- public.tim_lajcik(res text, record text, opponent text, method text, event text, round bigint, time text)

Evidence 1: Distribution of outcomes
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  GROUP BY res
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result:
  - res = 'win', count = 7
  - res = 'loss', count = 6
  - res = 'draw', count = 1

Evidence 2: Direct comparison of wins vs. losses
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
         SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'loss' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
         CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'win' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) <
                   SUM(CASE WHEN res = 'loss' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
              THEN true ELSE false END AS wins_fewer_than_losses
  FROM public.tim_lajcik;
- Result: wins = 7, losses = 6, wins_fewer_than_losses = false

Conclusion: The data show more wins (7) than losses (6). Therefore, the claim that there are fewer win results than loss results is not supported.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available results in public.tim_lajcik.
- "Win" and "loss" are identified by exact matches to res values 'win' and 'loss' as stored.
- No additional filtering (e.g., by event or date) was intended.
