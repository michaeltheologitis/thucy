Claim being checked: “steve stricker have the best score out of all of the player from the united state.”

Scope of verification: Available data includes a single golf table for the 2006 U.S. Open. I verify the claim within this dataset, interpreting “best score” as the lowest (best) to-par and total score among players whose country is recorded as “united states.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all rows to see leaderboard context
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf;
Key rows observed:
- 1 | steve stricker | united states | 70 + 69 = 139 | - 1
- Other U.S. players include: jim furyk (+2), jason dufner (+3), phil mickelson (+3), arron oberholser (+3)

2) Verify how the U.S. is labeled in the data
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf;
Result includes: united states (along with scotland, england, northern ireland, australia, ireland)

3) Confirm Steve Stricker’s row specifically
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Stricker%';
Result:
- 1 | steve stricker | united states | 70 + 69 = 139 | - 1

4) Compute numeric ordering among United States players to find the best score (lowest to-par, then lowest total)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country, score, "to par",
CASE WHEN lower("to par") IN ('e','even') THEN 0 ELSE CAST(regexp_replace(replace("to par", '−','-'), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g') AS integer) END AS numeric_to_par,
CAST(regexp_replace(score, '.*=\s*(\d+).*', '\\1') AS integer) AS numeric_total
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE country = 'united states'
ORDER BY numeric_to_par ASC, numeric_total ASC;
Result (ordered best to worst):
- steve stricker | united states | 70 + 69 = 139 | - 1 | numeric_to_par = -1 | numeric_total = 139
- jim furyk | united states | 70 + 72 = 142 | + 2 | 2 | 142
- jason dufner | united states | 72 + 71 = 143 | + 3 | 3 | 143
- phil mickelson | united states | 70 + 73 = 143 | + 3 | 3 | 143
- arron oberholser | united states | 75 + 68 = 143 | + 3 | 3 | 143

Findings:
- Within this dataset (2006 U.S. Open table), Steve Stricker has the best score among all players from the United States: to-par of -1 and total of 139. No other U.S. player matches or beats this score in the table.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data present.

Assumptions made:
- “Best score” is interpreted as the lowest to-par (and, if needed, lowest total score as a tiebreaker) for the 2006 U.S. Open table available.
- The claim is evaluated solely against the available dataset (t_2006_u_s_open_golf). If the user intended a different tournament, season, or career-wide context, that information is not present in the accessible data.
