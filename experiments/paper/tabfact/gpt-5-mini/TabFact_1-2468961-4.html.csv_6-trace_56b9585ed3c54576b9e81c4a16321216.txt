Claim to verify: “meedith siler and patrick duffy write the episode that originally air april 29 , 1994.”

Conclusion: The data shows that the Step by Step episode that originally aired on April 29, 1994 (“The Case of the Missing Diary”) was written by Howard Adler & Robert Griffard, not Meredith Siler and Patrick Duffy. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

Evidence from the database

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: list_of_step_by_step_episodes
- Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), title (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Step 1 — Inspect date formatting to query correctly
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by", "directed by", "original air date" FROM list_of_step_by_step_episodes LIMIT 20;
Observation: Dates are stored lowercase with a space before the comma (e.g., "april 29 , 1994").

Step 2 — Find the episode with original air date April 29, 1994
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by", "directed by", "original air date"
FROM list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%april 29 , 1994%';
Result:
- Title: the case of the missing diary
- No. in season: 21
- No. in series: 67
- Written by: howard adler & robert griffard
- Directed by: richard correll
- Original air date: april 29 , 1994
Interpretation: The episode airing on April 29, 1994 was written by Howard Adler & Robert Griffard.

Step 3 — Check whether Meredith Siler or Patrick Duffy have any writing credits in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "original air date", "written by" 
FROM list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%patrick duffy%'
   OR "written by" ILIKE '%meredith siler%'
   OR "written by" ILIKE '%siler%';
Results:
- Trading Places — october 22 , 1993 — meredith siler
- Thirteen with a Bullet — january 28 , 1994 — patrick duffy & bob rosenfarb
- My Bodyguard — february 4 , 1994 — meredith siler
Interpretation: Both Meredith Siler and Patrick Duffy have writing credits on Step by Step, but not for the April 29, 1994 episode.

Final assessment
- The specific episode that aired on April 29, 1994 was not written by Meredith Siler and Patrick Duffy. It was written by Howard Adler & Robert Griffard.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the TV series Step by Step, as the accessible data source provides a comprehensive episode list for this series and includes the April 29, 1994 air date.
- The name “meedith siler” is interpreted as a misspelling of “Meredith Siler.”
- Matching was performed against the "original air date" field stored as lowercase text with a space before the comma ("april 29 , 1994").
