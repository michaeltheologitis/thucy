Claim interpreted: “Triston Grant is the only player listed as left wing.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
- Relevant columns: player (text), position (text)

Evidence
1) Listing all players and positions
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season ORDER BY player;
- Result (player — position):
  - chris zarb — defense
  - david laliberte — right wing
  - frederik cabana — center
  - gino pisellini — right wing
  - john carter — center
  - ladislav scurko — center
  - martin houle — goaltender
  - r j anderson — defense
  - rob bellamy — right wing
  - travis gawryletz — defense
  - triston grant — left wing
- Supporting count query for total rows executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season;
  Result: 11

2) Targeted check for left wing entries
- SQL executed (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS left_wing_count FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE lower(position) = 'left wing';
  Result: left_wing_count = 1
- SQL executed (list):
  SELECT player, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE lower(position) = 'left wing' ORDER BY player;
  Result: player = triston grant, position = left wing

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly one player with position “left wing,” and that player is Triston Grant. The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the table t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season in the TabFact public schema.
- Position matching was treated case-insensitively (using lower(position) = 'left wing').
