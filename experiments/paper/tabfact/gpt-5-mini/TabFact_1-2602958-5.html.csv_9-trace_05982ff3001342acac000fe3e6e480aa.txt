Summary
- Claim: Episode 67 “The Lorelais’ First Day at Yale” has more viewers than episode 69 “Chicken or Beef?”.
- Finding: False. Episode 67 has 3.9 million viewers; episode 69 has 5.5 million viewers.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact28), schema: public.
- Table found: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes (episodes of “Gilmore Girls” with titles and U.S. viewership figures).

Schema (as discovered)
- Columns: "no" (bigint), "-" (bigint), "title" (text), "director" (text), "writer (s)" (text), "original air date" (text), "prod code" (bigint), "us viewers (million)" (double precision).

Evidence 1: Title-based retrieval
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no", "title", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Lorelais%' OR "title" ILIKE '%Chicken%';
- Results:
  - no = 67, title = the lorelais' first day at yale, us viewers (million) = 3.9
  - no = 69, title = chicken or beef, us viewers (million) = 5.5

Evidence 2: Episode-number-based confirmation
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no", "title", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE "no" IN (67, 69);
- Results:
  - Episode 67 — Title: the lorelais' first day at yale; U.S. viewers (million): 3.9
  - Episode 69 — Title: chicken or beef; U.S. viewers (million): 5.5

Conclusion
- Episode 67 (3.9M) does not have more viewers than episode 69 (5.5M). The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The "no" column represents the series’ absolute episode number.
- Minor differences in capitalization/punctuation of titles do not affect episode identity.
