Conclusion
- The episode titled “boardroom and a parked place” is present in the data with original air date “november 7 , 2002.”
- There are no episodes with an original air date of “november 7 , 2003” in the available table.
- Therefore, the claim that the air date is November 7, 2003 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- I treated the provided title literally; initial lookup used a case-insensitive search (ILIKE), followed by an exact match on the lowercase title stored in the table.
- I relied solely on the available TabFact database; within this dataset, the episode has the date november 7 , 2002.
- The table name suggests season 5, but the row shows season = 6 for this episode. I do not speculate beyond the dataset; I report it as stored.
