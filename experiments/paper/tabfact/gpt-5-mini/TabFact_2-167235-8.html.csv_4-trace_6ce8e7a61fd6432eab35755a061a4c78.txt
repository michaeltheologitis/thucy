Claim interpreted: Only one person who was a member of the Party of Labour of Albania (PLA) has been elected/served as Prime Minister (based on the available prime ministers dataset).

Summary conclusion: Supported by the available data. The table of Albanian prime ministers (1991 onwards) contains exactly one prime minister entry whose political party is recorded as “party of labour of albania”: Fatos Nano (first term, 22 February 1991 – 5 June 1991).

Evidence from data and executed SQL

1) Verify table structure (column names):
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania';
Result:
[{"column_name":"name","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"born - died","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"term start","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"term end","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"political party","data_type":"text"}]

2) Inspect distinct political party values present:
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania;
Result:
[{"political party":"party of labour of albania"},{"political party":"prime ministers 1991 onwards"},{"political party":"socialist party of albania"},{"political party":"democratic party of albania"},{"political party":"non - party"}]

3) List all rows (to understand scope and any header artifacts):
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", "term end", "political party"
FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
ORDER BY "term start";
Key rows in result (abridged):
- fatos nano (1st time) | 22 february 1991 – 5 june 1991 | party of labour of albania
- ylli bufi | 5 june 1991 – 10 december 1991 | socialist party of albania
- vilson ahmeti | 10 december 1991 – 13 april 1992 | non - party
- …
Note: One row appears to be a header artifact: "prime ministers 1991 onwards" repeated across columns.

4) Retrieve PMs whose political party equals Party of Labour of Albania:
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", "term end", "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" = 'party of labour of albania' ORDER BY "term start";
Result:
[{"name":"fatos nano (1st time)","political party":"party of labour of albania","term end":"5 june 1991","term start":"22 february 1991"}]

5) Count how many rows match that party label:
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" = 'party of labour of albania';
Result:
[{"count":1}]

6) Count distinct names with that party label (to ensure not double-counted terms):
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "name") AS count FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE LOWER("political party") = 'party of labour of albania';
Result:
[{"count":1}]

Conclusion
- The available dataset (prime ministers of Albania, 1991 onwards) shows exactly one person listed under the Party of Labour of Albania: Fatos Nano (first term). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data at hand.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Interpreted “be elect” as “be elected/serve as Prime Minister,” because the only available relevant table is a list of prime ministers.
- The table covers prime ministers from 1991 onwards; earlier historical periods are not represented here. Within this dataset’s scope, only one PLA-affiliated PM appears.
- One row is a header artifact ("prime ministers 1991 onwards"); it was not considered a valid record.
- Matching was done on the exact stored label “party of labour of albania” (also cross-checked case-insensitively).
