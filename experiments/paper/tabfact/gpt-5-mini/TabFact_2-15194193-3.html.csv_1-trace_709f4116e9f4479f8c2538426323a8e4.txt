Claim to verify: "all of alberto pagain's win be of the 500cc class" (interpreted as: All of Alberto Pagani’s wins were in the 500cc class.)

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8). It exposes the public schema with at least one table accessible.

Step 2 — Inspect schema relevant to the claim
- Table found: public.alberto_pagani
  Columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)

Step 3 — Collect evidence from data
A) List all rows where Alberto Pagani has wins > 0
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY class, year;
Result rows (class | points | team | wins | year):
- 500cc | 15 | linto     | 1 | 1969
- 500cc | 29 | linto     | 1 | 1971
- 500cc | 29 | mv agusta | 1 | 1971
- 500cc | 87 | mv agusta | 1 | 1972
Observation: Every row with wins > 0 is in class "500cc".

B) Aggregate wins by class
SQL executed:
SELECT class, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 GROUP BY class ORDER BY total_wins DESC, class;
Result (class | total_wins):
- 500cc | 4
Observation: Only the 500cc class has wins; total wins recorded = 4.

C) Cross-check totals to ensure no wins exist outside 500cc
SQL executed:
1) SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani;
   Result: total_wins = 4
2) SELECT SUM(wins) AS wins_500cc FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '500cc';
   Result: wins_500cc = 4
3) SELECT SUM(wins) AS wins_non_500cc FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class IS DISTINCT FROM '500cc';
   Result: wins_non_500cc = 0
Observation: All recorded wins are in 500cc; there are zero wins outside 500cc.

Conclusion
Based on the table public.alberto_pagani, every recorded win for Alberto Pagani is in the 500cc class. No wins are recorded in any other class.

Assumptions
- "alberto pagain" refers to the Italian Grand Prix motorcycle racer Alberto Pagani.
- The public.alberto_pagani table is authoritative for his GP results and the wins column denotes number of race wins in that season/class.
- Class matching is done on the exact string value "500cc" in the class column.
