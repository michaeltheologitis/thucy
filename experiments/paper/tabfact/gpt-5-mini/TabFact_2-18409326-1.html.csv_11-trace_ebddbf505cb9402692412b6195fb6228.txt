Scope and data sources explored:
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner). This table lists radio stations in Kelowna, BC, including their formats and owners.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify any station(s) with an Adult Hits format
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency, "format", owner
  FROM media_in_kelowna
  WHERE lower("format") LIKE '%adult hits%';
- Result:
  • call sign: cjui - fm; branding: 103.9 the juice; frequency: 0 103.9 fm; format: adult hits; owner: vista broadcast group

2) Broaden match to any substring 'adult hit' (singular or plural)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "branding", "frequency", "format", "owner"
  FROM public.media_in_kelowna
  WHERE "format" ILIKE '%adult hit%';
- Result (1 row):
  • cjui - fm | 103.9 the juice | 0 103.9 fm | adult hits | vista broadcast group
- Interpretation: The only Adult Hits station in this dataset is CJUI-FM (103.9 The Juice), and its owner is Vista Broadcast Group—not Bell Media.

3) Check which stations in Kelowna are owned by Bell Media and their formats
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency, format, owner
  FROM media_in_kelowna
  WHERE owner ILIKE '%bell media%'
  ORDER BY "call sign";
- Results:
  • chsu - fm | 99.9 sun fm | 00 99.9 fm | contemporary hits radio | bell media
  • cilk - fm | 101.5 ez rock | 0 101.5 fm | adult contemporary | bell media
- Interpretation: In the Kelowna dataset, Bell Media owns CHSU-FM (Contemporary Hits Radio) and CILK-FM (Adult Contemporary), but not the Adult Hits station.

Conclusion:
- The data shows the Adult Hits station (CJUI-FM, 103.9 The Juice) is owned by Vista Broadcast Group. Therefore, the claim that the owner is Bell Media is contradicted by the evidence in this authoritative dataset.

Assumptions made:
- Due to the available data scope, I interpreted “the radio station that play adult hit” as referring to the Adult Hits-format station listed in the media_in_kelowna table (Kelowna, BC). If a different city or specific station was intended, the verification would need the corresponding local dataset.
