Claim being checked: "there be more than 2 game that have a score higher than 10 point"

Data sources discovered
- Using the discovery tool, I found one accessible source: a PostgreSQL instance via the TabFact connector exposing the public schema with a single relevant table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season.

Schema overview
- Table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
  - The score column is text, e.g., "13 - 4" or "3 - 2 (10)"; the extra part like "(10)" denotes innings and should be ignored when extracting run totals.

Step 1 — Confirm dataset coverage (row count)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
- Result:
  row_count = 26

Step 2 — Inspect score formatting (sample rows)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 20;
- Sample results show score strings like:
  - september 21 | rockies | 13 - 4
  - september 13 | reds | 3 - 2 (10)

Step 3 — Count games where either team’s score exceeds 10
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_with_over_10
  FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  WHERE regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\1')::int > 10
     OR regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\2')::int > 10;
- Result:
  games_with_over_10 = 2

- Executed SQL (list those games and parsed runs):
  SELECT date, opponent, score,
         regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\1')::int AS run1,
         regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\2')::int AS run2
  FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  WHERE regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\1')::int > 10
     OR regexp_replace(score, '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\2')::int > 10
  ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  - september 21 | rockies | 13 - 4 | run1=13 | run2=4
  - september 25 | cardinals | 12 - 3 | run1=12 | run2=3

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 2 games in this table where at least one team scored more than 10. Therefore, the claim that there are more than 2 such games is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- Interpretation: I interpreted “a score higher than 10 point” to mean either team’s run total in a game exceeding 10, based on the score string containing two numbers. This is the most neutral interpretation given the wording.
- Scope: The table contains 26 games (likely a subset of a season). My conclusion is strictly within this dataset.
- Parsing: I used regex to extract the two run values before any optional extra-innings suffix like “(10)”.
