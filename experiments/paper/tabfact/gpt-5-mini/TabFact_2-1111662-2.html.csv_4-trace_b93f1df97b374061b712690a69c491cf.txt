Claim to verify: “the pole vault record be set on the 26th of august 2005.”

Scope and interpretation:
- I interpret “the pole vault record” as the pole vault event record listed in the Memorial Van Damme meeting records table available in the connected TabFact database, since that is the relevant authoritative dataset accessible here. This is a meeting record, not a global world record.

Evidence from the data:
- The Memorial Van Damme records table contains a single “pole vault” row with the date “26 august 2005,” athlete “yelena isinbayeva,” and record “4.93 m.”

Executed SQL (supporting evidence):
1) Retrieve the Pole Vault row
SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date
FROM memorial_van_damme
WHERE event ILIKE '%Pole Vault%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- event: pole vault; record: 4.93 m; athlete: yelena isinbayeva; nationality: russia; date: 26 august 2005

2) Context check of event names (shows only one pole vault entry)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT event, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE '%pole%' OR LOWER(event) LIKE '%vault%' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- event: pole vault; date: 26 august 2005

Assessment:
- The available data confirms that the Memorial Van Damme meeting’s pole vault record was set on 26 August 2005.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the accessible source.

Assumptions:
- “Pole vault record” refers to the Memorial Van Damme meeting record (not the world record, national record, or indoor record).
