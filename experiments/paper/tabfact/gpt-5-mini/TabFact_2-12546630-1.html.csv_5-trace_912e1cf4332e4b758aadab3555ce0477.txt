"Alfredo Binda was the race leader for 15 stages in the 1933 Giro d’Italia."

Summary conclusion
The data shows Alfredo Binda led 13 stages (not 15) in the 1933 Giro d’Italia. There were 17 actual stages; the other 4 stages were led by Learco Guerra (1) and Jef Demuysere (3).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public
- Relevant table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia

Schema inspected
- Columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), "race leader" (text)
- No primary keys or foreign keys.

Evidence 1 — Count of stages where race leader is Alfredo Binda
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE "race leader" ILIKE '%binda%';
Result:
- count = 13

Evidence 2 — Which stages (dates/courses) had Binda as race leader
SQL executed:
SELECT row_number() OVER (ORDER BY (SELECT NULL)) AS rownum, date, course, distance, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE "race leader" ILIKE '%Binda%';
Result rows:
1) 7 may — turin to genoa — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
2) 8 may — genoa to pisa — winner: learco guerra ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
3) 10 may — pisa to florence — winner: giuseppe olmo ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
4) 15 may — naples to foggia — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
5) 17 may — foggia to chieti — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
6) 18 may — chieti to ascoli piceno — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
7) 20 may — ascoli piceno to riccione — winner: fernand cornez ( fra ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
8) 21 may — riccione to bologna — winner: giuseppe olmo ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
9) 22 may — bologna to ferrara — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
10) 24 may — ferrara to udine — winner: ettore meini ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
11) 25 may — udine to bassano del grappa — winner: ettore meini ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
12) 26 may — bassano del grappa to bolzano — winner: gerard loncke ( bel ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
13) 28 may — bolzano to milan — winner: alfredo binda ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )

Evidence 3 — Per-rider breakdown of stages led and total rows
SQL executed:
1) Raw breakdown (includes non-stage markers in the column):
SELECT "race leader", COUNT(*) AS stages_led
FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
GROUP BY "race leader"
ORDER BY stages_led DESC, "race leader";
Returned values included: "alfredo binda ( ita )" = 13, "rest day" = 6, "jef demuysere ( bel )" = 3, "km (mi)" = 1, "learco guerra ( ita )" = 1.

2) Filtered per-rider breakdown (excluding non-rider entries 'rest day' and 'km (mi)'):
SELECT "race leader", COUNT(*) AS stages_led
FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
WHERE "race leader" NOT IN ('rest day', 'km (mi)')
GROUP BY "race leader"
ORDER BY stages_led DESC, "race leader";
Result:
- alfredo binda ( ita ): 13 stages
- jef demuysere ( bel ): 3 stages
- learco guerra ( ita ): 1 stage

3) Total rows in the table:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_stages FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia;
Result:
- total_stages = 24 (these include both actual stages and non-stage rows like rest days and a summary row)

Evidence 4 — Number of actual stages recorded (excluding non-stage rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS stage_count
FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
WHERE NOT (course ILIKE 'rest day' OR date ILIKE 'total' OR distance ILIKE '%km (mi)%');
Result:
- stage_count = 17 actual stages

Evidence 5 — Stages where Binda was NOT the race leader (who led instead)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
WHERE lower(course) != 'rest day'
  AND lower(distance) != 'km (mi)'
  AND lower("race leader") != 'rest day'
  AND lower(date) != 'total'
  AND lower("race leader") != 'km (mi)'
  AND lower("race leader") <> 'alfredo binda ( ita )';
Result rows:
- 6 may — milan to turin — winner: learco guerra ( ita ) — race leader: learco guerra ( ita )
- 11 may — florence to grosseto — winner: learco guerra ( ita ) — race leader: jef demuysere ( bel )
- 12 may — grosseto to rome — winner: mario cipriani ( ita ) — race leader: jef demuysere ( bel )
- 14 may — rome to naples — winner: gerard loncke ( bel ) — race leader: jef demuysere ( bel )

Conclusion
- Alfredo Binda led 13 of the 17 stages in the 1933 Giro d’Italia. The claim of 15 stages led is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Each row in t_1933_giro_d_italia corresponds to either a stage or a non-stage entry (e.g., 'rest day' or a summary row). Non-stage rows were excluded based on values such as course = 'rest day', date = 'total', or distance containing 'km (mi)'.
- Rider names and nationalities are taken verbatim from the table (e.g., 'alfredo binda ( ita )'); case-insensitive matching was used where appropriate.
