Claim interpreted: The user’s statement appears to assert that “the New York City Marathon in 1985 was the latest year a competition was held in New York City.” Because the only available data source contains a single athlete’s competition history (Orlando Pizzolato), I verify the claim within that scope: whether 1985 was the latest year this athlete competed in an event in New York City (i.e., the New York City Marathon) recorded in this dataset.

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema
- Single table available: public.orlando_pizzolato with columns: year (integer), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text)

Evidence from data
1) Find rows mentioning New York in competition or venue
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes
FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
WHERE competition ILIKE '%New York%'
   OR venue ILIKE '%New York%';
Result rows:
- 1984 | competition: new york city marathon | venue: new york , united states | position: 1st | notes: 2:14:53
- 1985 | competition: new york city marathon | venue: new york , united states | position: 1st | notes: 2:11:34

2) Latest year among those New York rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(year) AS max_year
FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
WHERE competition ILIKE '%New York%'
   OR venue ILIKE '%New York%';
Result:
- max_year: 1985

3) Show that the table includes years beyond 1985 overall (to confirm scope is per-athlete and not a full event calendar)
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(year) AS max_year FROM public.orlando_pizzolato;
Result:
- max_year: 1988

4) Count of New York entries (for completeness)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ny_count
FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
WHERE competition ILIKE '%New York%'
   OR venue ILIKE '%New York%';
Result:
- ny_count: 2

Assessment
- Within the available dataset (Orlando Pizzolato’s competition history), the New York City Marathon appears in 1984 and 1985, and the latest year recorded for a New York City competition is indeed 1985.
- However, this dataset does not represent the full history of the New York City Marathon. It cannot establish whether the marathon itself ceased after 1985 or continued; it only shows this athlete’s participations.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported if interpreted narrowly as “for the athlete Orlando Pizzolato, the latest year he had a competition in New York City (NYC Marathon) was 1985,” which the data verifies.
- The broader interpretation that 1985 was the last year the NYC Marathon (as an event) was held cannot be verified or refuted from the provided data.

Assumptions and scope notes
- I interpreted “competition be hold in New York City” as entries where competition or venue contains “New York.”
- The verification is scoped to the only available authoritative dataset (public.orlando_pizzolato), which records a single athlete’s results and not a comprehensive event calendar.
- Case-insensitive substring matching (ILIKE '%New York%') was used to detect mentions of New York.
