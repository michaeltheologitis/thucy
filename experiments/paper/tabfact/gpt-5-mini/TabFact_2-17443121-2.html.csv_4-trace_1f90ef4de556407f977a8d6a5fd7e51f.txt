Claim to verify: “there be only 2 new episode of gary unmarried in december 2009.”

Summary conclusion: The available data show zero Gary Unmarried episodes with air dates in December 2009. The table does include two December episodes, but they are in 2008, not 2009. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect all distinct air date values to understand formatting and spot December entries
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried ORDER BY "air date" NULLS LAST;
Key results (excerpt):
- april 8 , 2009

- december 17 , 2008
- february 11 , 2009
- february 18 , 2009
- january 14 , 2009

- march 11 , 2009
- march 18 , 2009
- may 20 , 2009
- may 6 , 2009
- november 12 , 2008
Observation: December entries in this dataset appear for 2008; none observed for 2009.

2) List all December entries (any year) to verify what December episodes exist
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" ILIKE '%december%';
Results:
- episode: gary goes first, air date: december 10 , 2008
- episode: gary toughens up tom, air date: december 17 , 2008
Observation: Two December episodes exist, both in 2008.

3) Directly test for December 2009 entries and count them
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_dec_2009 FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" ILIKE '%december%' AND "air date" ILIKE '%2009%';
Result:
- count_dec_2009: 0
Conclusion: No episodes in December 2009 are present in the dataset.

4) List all 2009 episodes to show which months of 2009 are present
SQL:

Final assessment
- The claim asserts there were two new episodes in December 2009. The authoritative dataset shows zero episodes with air dates in December 2009. It does show exactly two December episodes, but in 2008. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “New episode” is interpreted as an episode whose original air date falls in December 2009. The table’s “air date” column is taken as the original air date. The air date is stored as text; matching was done via case-insensitive substring searches for 'december' and '2009'.
