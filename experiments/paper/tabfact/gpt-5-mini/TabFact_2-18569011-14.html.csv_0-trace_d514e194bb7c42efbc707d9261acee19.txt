Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single relevant table.
- Inspected the schema to confirm presence of columns: lane, time, react.
- Queried the specific record for time = 20.45 and lane = 6, then evaluated react against the threshold 0.164 (interpreted as 164 ms).

Data source discovery
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact), schema: public
- Table: athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
  - Columns: lane (bigint), athlete (text), nationality (text), time (text), react (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve the record at time 20.45 in lane 6
SQL:
SELECT lane, athlete, time, react
FROM public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
WHERE time = '20.45' AND lane = 6;
Result:
- lane: 6
- athlete: jaysuma saidy ndure
- time: 20.45
- react: 0.131

2) Verify react < 0.164 (interpreting 164 as milliseconds)
SQL:
SELECT lane, time, react FROM public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres WHERE lane = 6 AND time = '20.45';
Comparison result: 0.131 < 0.164 = TRUE

Conclusion
- The record for lane 6 at time 20.45 has react = 0.131 seconds, which is less than 0.164 seconds (164 ms). This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “164” as 164 milliseconds (0.164 seconds), consistent with standard reaction time units in athletics. The time column is stored as text and matched exactly to '20.45'.
