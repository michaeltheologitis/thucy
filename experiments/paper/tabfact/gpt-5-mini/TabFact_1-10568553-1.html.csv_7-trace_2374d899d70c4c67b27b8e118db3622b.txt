Claim: “milepost 12.8 be at weymouth.”

Summary conclusion: According to the authoritative massachusetts_route_139 table in the TabFact PostgreSQL database, milepost 12.8 is located in Rockland (Plymouth County), not Weymouth.

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Direct lookup of milepost 12.8
SQL (executed exactly):
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE trim(milepost) = '12.8'
   OR (trim(milepost) ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' AND trim(milepost)::numeric = 12.8);
Result:
- county: plymouth; location: rockland; street names: north avenue plain street market street; milepost: 12.8; roads intersected: route 123; notes: eastern terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency

2) Check for any entries that mention Weymouth and their milepost values
SQL (executed exactly):
SELECT location, milepost
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE lower(location) LIKE '%weymouth%'
ORDER BY (milepost ~ '^\s*-?\d+(\.\d+)?\s*$') DESC,
         CASE WHEN milepost ~ '^\s*-?\d+(\.\d+)?\s*$' THEN CAST(milepost AS numeric) END,
         milepost;
Result:
- location: weymouth; milepost: (no major junctions)

3) Context around milepost 12.x to 13.5
SQL (executed exactly):
SELECT milepost, location, county, "street names", "roads intersected"
FROM massachusetts_route_139
WHERE trim(milepost) ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
  AND CAST(trim(milepost) AS numeric) BETWEEN 12.0 AND 13.5
ORDER BY CAST(trim(milepost) AS numeric) ASC;
Results:
- 12.2 — rockland (plymouth)
- 12.8 — rockland (plymouth)

4) Broad substring search for any milepost text containing “12.8”
SQL (executed exactly):
SELECT milepost, location, notes
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE milepost ILIKE '%12.8%';
Result:
- milepost: 12.8; location: rockland; notes: eastern terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency

Assessment:
- All evidence shows milepost 12.8 on MA Route 139 lies in Rockland, not Weymouth.

Assumptions (due to ambiguity):
- I interpreted the claim as referring to Massachusetts Route 139, because the only available authoritative dataset with mileposts in the connected data source is public.massachusetts_route_139.
- I treated the milepost column as numeric when it matched a simple numeric pattern; otherwise as text.
- If the claim referred to a different route or mode (e.g., rail), that context is not present in the available data source and the conclusion would not apply.
