Claim: “Se Ri Pak be the champion in 2001, then come 2nd place 2 year after.”

Data source discovery:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact10 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.women_s_british_open (Women’s British Open tournament results: year, dates, venue, champion, runner(s)-up, etc.)

Evidence 1 — 2001 result:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, dates, venue, champion, country, score, "to par", "margin of victory", "runner (s) - up", purse, "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year = 2001;
- Result (key fields):
  - Year: 2001
  - Champion: se ri pak (country: south korea)
  - Runner(s)-up: mi hyun kim
  - Venue: sunningdale golf club
  - Score: 277; To par: -11; Margin: 2 strokes

Evidence 2 — 2003 result (two years after):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, dates, venue, champion, country, score, "to par", "margin of victory", "runner (s) - up", purse, "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year = 2003;
- Result (key fields):
  - Year: 2003
  - Champion: annika sörenstam (country: sweden)
  - Runner(s)-up: se ri pak
  - Venue: royal lytham & st annes golf club
  - Score: 278; To par: -10; Margin: 1 stroke

Assessment:
- In 2001, Se Ri Pak is recorded as the champion of the Women’s British Open.
- Two years later (2003), Se Ri Pak is recorded as the runner-up.
- This matches the claim exactly under the Women’s British Open context.

Assumptions made:
- “be the champion in 2001” and “come 2nd place 2 year after” refer to the Women’s British Open specifically (the available dataset is for this tournament).
- “2 year after” is interpreted as 2003 (two years after 2001).
- Name casing in the database (lowercase) is normalized to standard capitalization for readability.
