Claim to verify: "shabazz muhammad attend ucla and his hometown be las vega , nv"

Data sources explored:
- TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
  - Identified relevant table: public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team (columns: player, height, school, hometown, college)

Evidence gathered:
- Query objective: Retrieve entries for Shabazz Muhammad and inspect the college and hometown fields.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT player, college, hometown
  FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
  WHERE player ILIKE '%shabazz muhammad%';
- Query result (distinct rows):
  - player: shabazz muhammad
    college: ucla
    hometown: las vegas , nv

Assessment of each sub-claim:
- "shabazz muhammad attend ucla" → Supported. The college field for Shabazz Muhammad is "ucla".
- "his hometown be las vega , nv" → Supported, with a minor spelling difference in the claim. The data shows "las vegas , nv" (the claim omits the final "s" in Vegas). The location matches aside from this typographical error.

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are supported by the data returned from the TabFact table.

Assumptions:
- The "college" field indicating "ucla" is sufficient to interpret that he attended UCLA.
- The "hometown" field represents the player’s hometown; minor spelling/spacing differences (e.g., an extra space before the comma) and the user’s typo do not change the substantive location match.
