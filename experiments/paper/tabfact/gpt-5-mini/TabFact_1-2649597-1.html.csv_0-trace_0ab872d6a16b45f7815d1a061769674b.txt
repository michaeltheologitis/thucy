Claim to verify: “Shane Hall ran a total of 190 races between the years 1995 and 2008.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.shane_hall
  - Columns: year (bigint), races (bigint), wins (bigint), poles (bigint), "top 5" (bigint), "top 10" (bigint), dnf (bigint), finish (double precision), start (double precision), winnings (bigint), "season rank" (text), "team (s)" (text)

Evidence
1) Total races from 1995 through 2008 (inclusive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
- Result:
  total_races = 190

2) Yearly breakdown within 1995–2008
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, races FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008 ORDER BY year;
- Result rows:
  {year:1995, races:2}, {year:1996, races:14}, {year:1997, races:28}, {year:1998, races:31}, {year:1999, races:25}, {year:2000, races:2}, {year:2001, races:33}, {year:2002, races:24}, {year:2003, races:5}, {year:2004, races:9}, {year:2005, races:7}, {year:2006, races:9}, {year:2008, races:1}

Conclusion
- The sum of races in public.shane_hall for years 1995–2008 equals 190. This supports the claim exactly.

Assumptions
- “Ran a total of 190 races” is interpreted as the sum of the ‘races’ column for years 1995–2008 inclusive.
- Years absent from the table in this range (e.g., 2007) contribute zero to the total.
