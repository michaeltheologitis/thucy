Claim interpreted: “21.08 is the arrival time of the train that departs at 21.26.”

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. In the available schedule table, there is no train that departs at 21.26, nor any train whose arrival time is 21.08. Instead, there is a train that departs at 21.08 and arrives at 21.26.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):

1) Check whether any train departs at 21.26 (exact text match)
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE departure = '21.26';
Result: cnt = 0

2) Check departures containing either “21:26” or “21.26” (substring search)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE departure LIKE '%21:26%' OR departure LIKE '%21.26%';
Result: match_count = 0

SQL executed:
SELECT departure, arrival, operator, "going to", "calling at"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE departure LIKE '%21:26%' OR departure LIKE '%21.26%';
Result: no rows returned

3) Check whether any train has arrival = 21.08 (exact numeric match)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE arrival = 21.08;
Result: cnt = 0

4) What actually exists at these times
4a) Trains with arrival = 21.26
SQL executed:
SELECT departure, arrival, operator, "going to", "calling at" 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE arrival = 21.26;
Result (1 row):
- departure: 21.08
- arrival: 21.26
- operator: gnr
- going to: skegness
- calling at: wainfleet , skegness

4b) Distinct departure values (to understand formatting and availability)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT departure FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY departure LIMIT 200;
Results (excerpt):
07.10; 08.47; 10.25; 10.28; 11.02; 11.15; 11.37 (mon); 11.49; 11.53; 12.40; 13.10; 16.15; 17.03; 18.16; 19.07; 19.15 (fri); 19.23; 21.00; 21.06; 21.08
Observation: “21.26” does not appear as a departure value; “21.08” does appear but as a departure, not an arrival.

4c) Distinct arrival values
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT arrival FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY arrival ASC LIMIT 200;
Results (ascending):
7.28, 9.01, 10.39, 11.30, 11.32, 11.33, 11.52, 12.08, 12.20, 13.00, 13.21, 16.29, 18.27, 18.46, 19.30, 19.34, 19.50, 20.00, 21.26, 21.53, 22.23
Observation: 21.26 appears as an arrival value; 21.08 does not.

Overall assessment
- No train departs at 21.26 (no rows match that departure).
- No train arrives at 21.08 (no rows match that arrival).
- There is a train that departs at 21.08 and arrives at 21.26, which is the reverse of the claim.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to a single train record where departure = 21.26 and arrival = 21.08.
- The only accessible authoritative dataset is the TabFact database’s public.my_info_table, which appears to be a rail timetable with times formatted as hour.minute in the departure text column and stored as numeric in the arrival column.
- Equality and pattern matches were tested for both exact values and common time formats seen in the data (dot-separated).
