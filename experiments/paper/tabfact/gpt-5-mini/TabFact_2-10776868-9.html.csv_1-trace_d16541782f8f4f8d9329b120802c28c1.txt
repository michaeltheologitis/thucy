Claim to verify: “the game between Footscray and Carlton be play at princess park.”

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Table: public.t_1962_vfl_season (columns: home team, away team, venue, scores, crowd, date)

Evidence gathered:
1) Broad search for any matches involving Carlton or Footscray
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "venue", "home team score", "away team score"
  FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%carl%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%carl%'
     OR "home team" ILIKE '%foot%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%foot%'
  ORDER BY "date";
- Result row returned:
  - date: 23 june 1962
  - home team: carlton
  - away team: footscray
  - venue: princes park
  - home team score: 12.9 (81)
  - away team score: 9.10 (64)

2) Case-insensitive exact match for Carlton vs Footscray fixtures
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, "home team score", "away team score"
  FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
  WHERE (lower("home team") = 'carlton' AND lower("away team") = 'footscray')
     OR (lower("home team") = 'footscray' AND lower("away team") = 'carlton')
  ORDER BY date;
- Result row returned:
  - 23 june 1962 — home: Carlton (12.9 (81)), away: Footscray (9.10 (64)), venue: princes park

Assessment:
- The 1962 VFL season data shows a Carlton vs Footscray match on 23 June 1962 at “princes park,” which corresponds to Princes Park (Carlton’s traditional home ground). This directly supports the claim for that fixture.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data for the 23 June 1962 Carlton vs Footscray game.

Assumptions made:
- I interpreted “the game” as referring to the fixture recorded in the available dataset (1962 VFL season). If a different season or a future fixture was intended, that is outside the scope of the accessible data.
- The venue string “princes park” in the dataset corresponds to Princes Park (correct spelling is “Princes Park,” not “Princess Park”).
