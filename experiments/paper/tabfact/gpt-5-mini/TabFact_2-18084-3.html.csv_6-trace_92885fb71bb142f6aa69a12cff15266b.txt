Claim: “all athlete have the same wind except eric walder and bob beamon.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Schema: public
- Table: long_jump(mark text, wind double precision, athlete text, nationality text, venue text, date text)

Evidence collected
1) Full table contents (to see athletes and wind values)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT athlete, wind, mark, nationality, venue, date FROM long_jump ORDER BY athlete;
- Key results (athlete → wind):
  • bob beamon → 2.0
  • carl lewis → 0.2
  • dwight phillips → 1.2
  • erick walder → 2.0
  • irving saladino → 1.2
  • iván pedroso → 1.9
  • larry myricks → 1.4
  • loúis tsátoumas → 1.6
  • mike powell → 0.3
  • robert emmiyan → 1.9

2) Wind values and which athletes have them (to assess uniformity)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT wind, array_agg(athlete ORDER BY athlete) AS athletes FROM long_jump GROUP BY wind ORDER BY wind;
- Results:
  • 0.2 → [carl lewis]
  • 0.3 → [mike powell]
  • 1.2 → [dwight phillips, irving saladino]
  • 1.4 → [larry myricks]
  • 1.6 → [loúis tsátoumas]
  • 1.9 → [iván pedroso, robert emmiyan]
  • 2.0 → [bob beamon, erick walder]

3) Do all athletes (except the two named) share the same wind?
- SQL executed (case-insensitive exclusion):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT wind) AS distinct_wind_count
  FROM public.long_jump
  WHERE lower(athlete) NOT IN ('bob beamon','erick walder');
- Result:
  distinct_wind_count = 6
- SQL executed (to list those winds):
  SELECT DISTINCT wind
  FROM public.long_jump
  WHERE lower(athlete) NOT IN ('bob beamon','erick walder')
  ORDER BY wind;
- Results:
  0.2, 0.3, 1.2, 1.4, 1.6, 1.9
- Interpretation: Excluding Bob Beamon and Erick Walder, there are still six different wind values among the remaining athletes, not one. Therefore, the winds are not all the same among the others.

4) Verify the wind values for the two named athletes
- SQL executed:
  SELECT athlete, wind FROM public.long_jump WHERE lower(athlete) IN ('bob beamon', 'erick walder') ORDER BY athlete;
- Results:
  • bob beamon → 2.0
  • erick walder → 2.0

Conclusion
- The data show multiple distinct wind values across athletes. Excluding Bob Beamon and Erick Walder does not make the rest share a single common wind; the remaining athletes still have six different wind readings. Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the long_jump table in the TabFact (postgres_tabfact8) database.
- Athlete name in the data is “erick walder” (with a ‘k’). I treated the user’s “eric walder” as the same person and used case-insensitive matching in queries.
