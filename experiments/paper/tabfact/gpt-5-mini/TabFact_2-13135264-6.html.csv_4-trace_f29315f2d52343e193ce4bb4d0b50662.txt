Summary
Claim: “the highest point gap be on january 5, with a spread of 6 point.”
Conclusion: Supported by the season data for the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings; the maximum goal differential is 6, occurring on January 5.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact7 (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine the maximum spread (absolute goal differential) from the score column:
SQL:
SELECT MAX(spread) AS max_spread
FROM (
  SELECT ABS(((regexp_matches(score, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1])::int - ((regexp_matches(score, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2])::int) AS spread
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
) AS sub;
Result: {"max_spread": 6}

2) Retrieve all games with that maximum spread:
SQL:
SELECT t.date, t.visitor, t.home, t.score, ABS(r.v - r.h) AS spread
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season t,
LATERAL (
  SELECT (regexp_matches(t.score, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[1]::int AS v,
         (regexp_matches(t.score, '(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)'))[2]::int AS h
) AS r
WHERE ABS(r.v - r.h) = 6
ORDER BY spread DESC, date;
Result rows:
- date: january 5, visitor: nashville, home: detroit, score: 0 - 6, spread: 6

Interpretation
- The largest goal differential recorded in the table is 6, and the sole game with that spread occurred on “january 5.” This matches the claim precisely: highest point gap on January 5, spread of 6 points.

Assumptions
- “Point gap”/“spread” is interpreted as the absolute goal differential between the two teams’ scores in the score column.
- The date values are stored as lowercase text like “january 5”; year context is the 2003–04 season inferred from the table name.
