Summary
- Interpreted claim: In the dataset of state leaders (820s BC), the entry with “from 830 bc” corresponds to the state “song.”
- Conclusion: The data directly supports this claim.

Data source exploration
- Available data source: postgres_tabfact7 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc
- Columns: state (text), type (text), name (text), title (text), royal house (text), from (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check all entries for the state “Song” and inspect their “from” value
SQL:
SELECT state, name, title, "royal house", "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE lower(state) = 'song';
Result:
- state: song | name: hui | title: duke | royal house: - | from: 830 bc

2) Check which state is recorded for the exact “from” value of 830 bc
SQL:
SELECT state, name, title, "royal house", "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE "from" = '830 bc';
Result:
- state: song | name: hui | title: duke | royal house: - | from: 830 bc

Assessment
- Both queries consistently show that the entry with “from: 830 bc” is for the state “song,” confirming the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the contents of the table list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc.
- Matching for the state name is case-insensitive ("song" vs. "Song").
- The string '830 bc' in the “from” column is taken as-is without normalizing to other date formats (e.g., BCE).
