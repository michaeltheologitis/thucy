Claim to verify: A UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a 1–3 score was held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact7), schema public.
- Table used: public.branimir_suba_i(date text, venue text, score text, result text, competition text).

Step 1: Direct search for the exact claim (competition mentions UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying, venue Andorra la Vella, score 1–3)
Executed SQL (returned 0 rows):
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE lower(venue) = 'andorra la vella, andorra'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%uefa%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%2008%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%qualif%'
  AND score ~ '1\s*[-–]\s*3';

Step 2: Variants/relaxations to ensure we don’t miss formatting differences
2a) Same venue + score 1–3; any competition (0 rows):
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE lower(venue) = 'andorra la vella, andorra'
  AND score ~ '1\s*[-–]\s*3';

2b) Venue contains 'andorra la vella' + full competition filter + score 1–3 (0 rows):
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%andorra la vella%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%uefa%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%2008%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%qualif%'
  AND score ~ '1\s*[-–]\s*3';

2c) Broader venue contains 'andorra' + competition contains 'uefa' + score 1–3 (0 rows):
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%andorra%'
  AND lower(competition) LIKE '%uefa%'
  AND score ~ '1\s*[-–]\s*3';

Step 3: Confirm what exists for the venue 'Andorra la Vella'
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE venue ILIKE '%andorra la vella%';
Result:
- competition: friendly; date: june 4 , 2008; result: win; score: 1 - 2; venue: andorra la vella , andorra
Interpretation: The table contains a match at this venue, but it is a friendly with score 1–2, not 1–3.

Step 4: Check UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches with a 1–3 score (any venue)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE competition ILIKE '%UEFA Euro 2008%' AND competition ILIKE '%qualifying%';
Result (1 row):
- date: june 2 , 2007; venue: baku , azerbaijan; score: 1 - 3; result: lost; competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying
Interpretation: A 1–3 UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match exists, but it was in Baku, Azerbaijan—not Andorra la Vella.

Step 5: Double-check that no 1–3 score is recorded at the Andorra la Vella venue under any competition
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%andorra la vella%' AND regexp_replace(score, E'\s|–', '', 'g') = '1-3';
Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion
- The data shows no UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a 1–3 score held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra. One match at that venue exists but with score 1–2 (friendly). A separate UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a 1–3 score exists in Baku, Azerbaijan. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive text matching for venue and competition.
- Score normalization accounts for optional spaces and hyphen/en-dash variants when checking for 1–3.
