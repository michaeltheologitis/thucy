Claim to verify: "google chrome support both vp8 (webm) 6.0 and vp9 (webm) 29.0"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table: html5_video.
- Table columns include: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 ( webm ), vp9 ( webm ).

Evidence gathered via SQL:
1) Identify exact browser name values to match:
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT browser FROM public.html5_video ORDER BY browser;
Result:
- android browser
- chromium
- google chrome
- internet explorer
- konqueror
- safari

2) Retrieve VP8 and VP9 support values for Google Chrome:
Executed SQL:
SELECT "operating system", "latest stable release", "vp8 ( webm )", "vp9 ( webm )" FROM public.html5_video WHERE browser = 'google chrome';
Result row:
- operating system: 30.0.1599.101 (october 15 , 2013 )
- latest stable release: 30.0.1599.101 (october 15 , 2013 )
- vp8 ( webm ): 6.0
- vp9 ( webm ): 29.0

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists for browser "google chrome" that VP8 (WebM) support is at version 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) support is at version 29.0. This aligns exactly with the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Support ... 6.0/29.0" is interpreted as the Chrome version at which support is available, as recorded in the html5_video table. The dataset appears to reflect status around the listed latest stable release (2013), but the claim does not specify timeframe, and the support-introduction versions match.
