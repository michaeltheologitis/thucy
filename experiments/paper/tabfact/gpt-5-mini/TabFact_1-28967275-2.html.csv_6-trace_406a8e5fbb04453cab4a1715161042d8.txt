Claim interpreted: The title of the episode with series number 14 is “new rule”.

Findings grounded in data:
- Data source: TabFact (public schema), table: public.my_info_table with columns: "episode" (bigint), "series" (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint).

Evidence 1: List distinct titles where series = 14
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "episode title" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "series" = 14 ORDER BY "episode title";
- Result:
  - new order

Evidence 2: Check if any row has series = 14 and title = 'new rule' (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE series = 14
    AND lower("episode title") = 'new rule';
- Result: match_count = 0

Evidence 3: Full row(s) for series = 14
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "series" = 14;
- Result (1 row):
  - episode: 40
  - series: 14
  - episode title: new order
  - original air date: 26 july 2008
  - production code: 214

Conclusion:
- The table shows that for series number 14, the episode title is “new order,” not “new rule.” No rows match the title “new rule” for series 14.

Assumptions:
- “Series number” refers to the column named "series" in public.my_info_table.
- Title comparison is case-insensitive for verifying the claim about “new rule.”
