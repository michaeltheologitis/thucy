Claim to verify: “Miguel Zapata be the goalkeeper with 24 goals and an average of 0.61.”

What the data shows
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema, table: t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (columns: goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team).

Evidence 1 — Retrieve Miguel Zapata’s row
Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE 'Miguel Zapata';
Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata
- team: atlético ciudad
- goals: 17
- matches: 28
- average: 0.61

Evidence 2 — Check if any goalkeeper has goals = 24 and average = 0.61
Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE goals = 24 AND average = 0.61;
Result: No rows returned

Evidence 3 — List any goalkeeper with name containing “zapata” (to ensure no alternate entries)
Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE '%zapata%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata; goals: 17; matches: 28; average: 0.61; team: atlético ciudad

Evidence 4 — Cross-check the average from goals and matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, (goals::float / NULLIF(matches,0)) AS calc_avg, (average - (goals::float / NULLIF(matches,0))) AS diff
FROM public."t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b"
WHERE goalkeeper = 'miguel zapata';
Result:
- goals: 17; matches: 28; stored average: 0.61; calc_avg: 0.6071428571428571; diff: 0.0028571428571428914
Interpretation: The stored average of 0.61 is consistent with 17/28 when rounded to two decimals.

Conclusion
- Correct: The average of 0.61 for Miguel Zapata is supported by the data.
- Incorrect: The goals value is 17 (not 24) in the dataset.

Assumptions
- “Goal” refers to the “goals” column in the t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b table, which for goalkeepers typically represents goals conceded in this dataset.
- The claim refers to the same season and dataset represented by the table (2008–09 Segunda División B).
