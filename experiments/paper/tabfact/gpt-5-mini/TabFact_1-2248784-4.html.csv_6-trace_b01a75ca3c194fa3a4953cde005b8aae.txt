Summary conclusion: Based on the only available authoritative dataset (TabFact public schema), Israel’s GDP (PPP) in 2011 is 235.446 (billions of USD). This does not match the claim that “israel have a gdp of 36.897.”

Data source discovery:
- Verified accessible data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with schema public. One relevant table was found: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp, which contains 2011 GDP (PPP) values in billions of USD for Asian and Pacific countries.

Schema details (as retrieved):
- Table: public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
  - Columns:
    - "rank mideast" (bigint)
    - "rank asia" (bigint)
    - "rank world" (bigint)
    - country (text)
    - "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Israel’s row
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE country ILIKE '%israel%';
Result:
{ "rank asia": 19, "rank mideast": 4, "rank world": 50, "country": "israel", "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd": 235.446 }

2) Retrieve Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) value directly
SQL:
SELECT "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd", country FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE country ILIKE '%israel%';
Result:
country: israel
2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd: 235.446

Assessment:
- The dataset shows Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) is 235.446 billion USD. This is not equal to 36.897 by any clear unit within this data source.

Answer: The claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and scope:
- Interpreted “gdp” as GDP (PPP) because the only available dataset provides 2011 GDP (PPP) in billions of USD. If a different measure (e.g., nominal GDP, per‑capita, or a different year) was intended, that is not represented in the accessible data and could yield a different figure.
