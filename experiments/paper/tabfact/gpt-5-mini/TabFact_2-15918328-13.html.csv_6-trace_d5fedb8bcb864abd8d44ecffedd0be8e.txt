Claim to verify: “the choreographer (s) for the style jazz be tyce diorio and sonya tayeh”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26), schema: public
- Relevant table: so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 with columns [couple, style, music, choreographer (s), results]

Step 1: Identify all entries where style contains “jazz” and list their choreographer(s).
SQL executed:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE lower(style) LIKE '%jazz%';

Result (1 row):
- couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura | style: jazz | music: the garden- mirah | choreographer (s): sonya tayeh | results: kanemura eliminated

Distinct choreographer(s) for Jazz entries:
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "choreographer (s)"
FROM so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE lower(style) LIKE '%jazz%';

Result:
- sonya tayeh

Step 2: Check appearances of Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh in the table and the styles they choreographed.
SQL executed:
SELECT "choreographer (s)" AS choreographers, style, couple, music
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%tyce%'
   OR "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%diorio%'
   OR "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%sonya%';

Results:
1) choreographers: sonya tayeh | style: jazz | couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura | music: the garden- mirah
2) choreographers: tyce diorio | style: contemporary | couple: katee shean joshua allen | music: all by myself - celine dion

Analysis:
- Within this dataset (SYTYCD U.S. Season 4 table), the only Jazz entry lists Sonya Tayeh as the choreographer.
- Tyce Diorio appears in the table, but for the style Contemporary, not Jazz.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the choreographer(s) for the style Jazz are Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh is not supported by the data. The data shows Jazz choreographed by Sonya Tayeh only; Tyce Diorio is associated with Contemporary in this table.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the SYTYCD U.S. Season 4 table available in the database and to entries where the style column contains “jazz.”
- Matching for “jazz” was case-insensitive and used substring containment to account for possible variations.
