Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources, identified the relevant database and table, inspected the schema, and then ran targeted SQL queries to check which players (if any) finished under par and specifically what Isao Aoki’s “to par” value was.

Data sources discovered
- A PostgreSQL database named TabFact (postgres_tabfact14) was accessible.

Relevant table and schema
- Table: public.t_1981_open_championship
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), "to par" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to understand formatting of the "to par" field
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship LIMIT 50;
- Returned (excerpt):
  [{"place":"t1","player":"vicente fernã¡ndez","score":70,"to par":"e"},
   {"place":"t1","player":"nick job","score":70,"to par":"e"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"isao aoki","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"david graham","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"tony jacklin","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"johnny miller","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"simon owen","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t3","player":"hal sutton (a)","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"howard clark","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"ben crenshaw","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"david jagger","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"mark james","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"greg norman","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"arnold palmer","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"bill rogers","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"},
   {"place":"t9","player":"sam torrance","score":72,"to par":"+ 2"}]
- Observation: Only values seen are E, +1, +2; no negatives appear.

2) Retrieve distinct values of "to par"
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY "to par";
- Result:
  [{"to par":"+ 1"}, {"to par":"+ 2"}, {"to par":"e"}]

3) Count rows that would indicate under par (negative); given the observed formats, these would be values neither 'E' nor starting with '+'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS negative_count FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE lower("to par") NOT LIKE 'e' AND "to par" NOT LIKE '+%';
- Result:
  [{"negative_count":0}]

4) Retrieve Isao Aoki’s entry
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Isao%' OR player ILIKE '%Aoki%';
- Result:
  [{"place":"t3","player":"isao aoki","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"}]
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE player = 'isao aoki';
- Result:
  [{"place":"t3","score":71,"to par":"+ 1"}]

5) Distribution of "to par" values
- SQL executed:
  SELECT UPPER(REPLACE("to par", ' ', '')) AS to_par_norm, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
  GROUP BY UPPER(REPLACE("to par", ' ', ''))
  ORDER BY (CASE WHEN UPPER(REPLACE("to par", ' ', '')) = 'E' THEN 0 ELSE CAST(replace(UPPER(REPLACE("to par", ' ', '')),'+','') AS INTEGER) END);
- Result:
  E: 2, +1: 6, +2: 8 (total rows: 16)

Findings
- In this dataset, no player has a negative "to par" value. All entries are E, +1, or +2.
- Isao Aoki’s "to par" is +1 in this table, which is not under par.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data, the claim that “in the 1981 Open Championship no player finished under par except Isao Aoki” is contradicted: this dataset shows zero players under par, and Isao Aoki is recorded at +1 (over par).

Assumptions and scope notes
- The table appears to capture a partial leaderboard (16 rows) with positions like t1, t3, t9 and only E, +1, +2 values, which is consistent with an early-round leaderboard excerpt rather than full final standings. My verification is strictly based on the data available in this table. If the intended claim concerns the final tournament results across all competitors, that information is not present in the accessible dataset; however, within the scope of the provided data, the claim is inaccurate.
