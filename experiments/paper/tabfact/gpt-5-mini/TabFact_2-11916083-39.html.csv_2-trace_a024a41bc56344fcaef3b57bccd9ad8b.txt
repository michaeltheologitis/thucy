SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage, "issue price"
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
WHERE "issue price" = 59.95
  AND (
    REPLACE(TRIM(mintage), ',', '') = '31997'
    OR TRIM(mintage) ILIKE '%31,997%'
    OR TRIM(mintage) ILIKE '%31997%'
  );

- 2001 — the russell light four — john mardon — 41828
- 2002 — the gray - dort — john mardon — 35944
- 2003 — hmcs bras dor — don curley — 31997  ← matches the claim
(Additional lines showed related “included in …” set components with the same issue price.)

Conclusion
- The dataset contains a coin entry with mintage 31,997 and an issue price of 59.95: the 2003 “HMCS Bras d'Or” (artist: Don Curley). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to at least one item (i.e., existence) rather than all items with that mintage.
- Prices are in Canadian dollars and the context is Royal Canadian Mint numismatic issues from the 2000s, per the table’s scope.
- Mintage is compared in normalized numeric form to account for potential comma formatting in the text field.
