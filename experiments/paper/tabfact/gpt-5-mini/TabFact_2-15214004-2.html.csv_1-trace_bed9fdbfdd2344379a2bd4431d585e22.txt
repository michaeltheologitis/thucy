Claim to verify: "jonathan leather be pick 25th"

Data source discovery:
- Explored available relational data sources. Found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing one relevant table: public.t_2008_mls_superdraft (2008 MLS SuperDraft picks).

Schema details (public.t_2008_mls_superdraft):
- Columns: pick (bigint), "mls team" (text), player (text), position (text), affiliation (text)
- Domain: Major League Soccer 2008 SuperDraft

Evidence query and result:
- Purpose: Check whether a player named similar to "Jonathan Leather" appears and what the draft pick number is.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT pick, player FROM public.t_2008_mls_superdraft
WHERE player ILIKE 'jonathan leather%'
   OR player ILIKE 'jonathan leathers%'
   OR player ILIKE 'jon leather%'
   OR player ILIKE 'jon leathers%'
   OR player ILIKE 'jonathon leather%'
   OR player ILIKE 'jonathon leathers%';
- Result: One matching entry found — pick = 25, player = "jonathan leathers".

Assessment:
- The data shows that Jonathan Leathers was the 25th pick in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft. The claim’s wording uses "leather" (singular) instead of "Leathers" (the correct surname) but asserts being the 25th pick, which matches the data.

Conclusion: The core claim (picked 25th) is supported by the data, with a minor name spelling variance.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 2008 MLS SuperDraft and the player Jonathan Leathers, allowing for a minor misspelling of the surname and typical first-name variants for matching.
