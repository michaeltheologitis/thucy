Claim to verify: “2 game have a score of more than 10 point.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public. Relevant table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text).

How “score” is stored (sample inspection)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
LIMIT 15;
Observation: score is stored as a string like “X - Y” (optionally “X - Y (N)” for extra innings). This allows extracting the two run totals per game.

Main verification
Interpretation used for the claim: number of games in which any team scored more than 10 runs (i.e., max of the two run values > 10).

1) Count of games where any team scored more than 10
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS any_team_gt_10
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE GREATEST(
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int,
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int
) > 10;
Result: any_team_gt_10 = 2

2) Games where any team scored more than 10 (for transparency)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score,
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int AS runs_team1,
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int AS runs_team2
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE GREATEST(
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int,
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int
) > 10
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- september 21 | rockies   | 13 - 4 | 13 | 4
- september 25 | cardinals | 12 - 3 | 12 | 3

Additional context (alternative reading)
If the claim intended “combined score > 10 runs,” the result is different.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS combined_gt_10
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE (
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 1), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int +
  regexp_replace(split_part(score, ' - ', 2), '^\s*(\d+).*', '\\1')::int
) > 10;
Result: combined_gt_10 = 5

Conclusion
- Under the natural interpretation that “a score of more than 10” means at least one team scored more than 10 runs in the game, the data confirms there are exactly 2 such games.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to the per-team run totals in the score column. “More than 10 point” is interpreted as any team’s runs > 10 in a game, not the combined total. Parsing of scores strips any extra-innings notation and reads only the leading integers on each side of the hyphen.
