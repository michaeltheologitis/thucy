Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data sources and inspected the schema.
- Queried the only available table listing football clubs and their continents to verify whether Japan is the only club located in Oceania.

Data source discovery
Tool: discover_data_sources
Finding: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact9) with a public schema.

Schema inspection
Tool: schema_query
Result: Single table in public schema:
- list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs(no TEXT, football club TEXT, continent TEXT, associated football club TEXT, seasons TEXT, racing drivers TEXT)

Evidence 1: Count of clubs by continent
Executed SQL:
SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS club_count
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
GROUP BY continent
ORDER BY club_count DESC;
Result:
- europe: 9
- oceania: 2
- asia: 2
- s america: 1
Interpretation: There are 2 clubs labeled as located in Oceania in this table, not 1.

Evidence 2: Which clubs are in Oceania
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower(continent) = 'oceania';
Result:
- team new zealand
- team australia
Interpretation: At least two clubs in the dataset are located in Oceania.

Evidence 3: Where “Japan” appears and its continent
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", continent
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%japan%';
Result:
- team japan | asia
Interpretation: The club containing “Japan” is listed under Asia, not Oceania.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows two clubs in Oceania (Team New Zealand and Team Australia), and “Team Japan” is categorized under Asia. Therefore, the claim that “Japan is the only football club located in Oceania” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and clarifications
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the football clubs listed in the available dataset (Superleague Formula-associated clubs) and their continent labels.
- Treated continent labels as provided in the table (e.g., "oceania"), without external normalization.
