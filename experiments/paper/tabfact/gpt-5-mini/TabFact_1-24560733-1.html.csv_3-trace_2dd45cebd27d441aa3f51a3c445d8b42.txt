Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data sources and inspected the schema.
- Found one relevant table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team, which records the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football games.
- Verified the number of games by month (September, October, November) using SQL queries on the date field.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Inspect all rows to confirm date formats and coverage
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
ORDER BY game;

Key observations from results (10 rows):
- Dates present: 'sept 20', 'sept 27', 'oct 4', 'oct 11', 'oct 18', 'oct 25', 'nov 1', 'nov 8', 'nov 15', 'nov 22'.
- This suggests 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November.

2) Extract distinct month abbreviations
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT lower(substring(date FROM '([A-Za-z]+)')) AS month_abbr
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
ORDER BY month_abbr;

Result returned:
- nov
- oct
- sept

3) Count games per month abbreviation
SQL executed:
SELECT lower(substring(date FROM '([A-Za-z]+)')) AS month_abbr, COUNT(*) AS games_count
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
GROUP BY month_abbr
ORDER BY month_abbr;

Result returned:
- month_abbr = nov, games_count = 4
- month_abbr = oct, games_count = 4
- month_abbr = sept, games_count = 2

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team.

Assumptions
- “the wildcat” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team represented in the only available dataset (1947 season).
- Month parsing treats the leading alphabetic substring of the date text as the month abbreviation ('sept', 'oct', 'nov').
