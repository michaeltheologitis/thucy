Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that the population was 1602 in 1801 and 1847 in 1811.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table

Schema details (relevant columns):
- year (text)
- "1801" (bigint), "1811" (bigint), plus additional year-numbered bigint columns

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Quick preview to understand structure
SQL:
SELECT year, "1801", "1811" FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 10;
Returned rows:
1) { year: "year",       "1801": 1801, "1811": 1811 }
2) { year: "population", "1801": 1602, "1811": 1847 }
3) { year: "year",       "1801": 1911, "1811": 1921 }
4) { year: "population", "1801": 4527, "1811": 4526 }
Interpretation: The table alternates between a row labeled "year" (holding year labels in the numeric columns) and a row labeled "population" (holding population counts for those years). The second row shows exactly 1801 → 1602 and 1811 → 1847.

2) Targeted retrieval of population values
SQL:
SELECT "1801", "1811" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE year = 'population';
Result:
- Row 1: {"1801":1602, "1811":1847}
- Row 2: {"1801":4527, "1811":4526}
Interpretation: There are at least two population series in the table; one of them matches the claim exactly.

3) Full context for the population rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE year = 'population';
Result:
- Row 1: {"1801":1602,"1811":1847,"1821":2364,"1841":3365,"1851":3832,"1861":3733,"1871":3903,"1881":3571,"1891":4201,"1901":4221,"year":"population"}
- Row 2: {"1801":4527,"1811":4526,"1821":4779,"1841":5182,"1851":5291,"1861":5293,"1871":5673,"1881":6282,"1891":7521,"1901":8738,"year":"population"}
Interpretation: The first population row supports the claim (1801=1602; 1811=1847). Another population row exists with different values, indicating multiple entities/series are present though not labeled by location in this table.

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains a population series where the values are 1602 (in 1801) and 1847 (in 1811), exactly as claimed. However, multiple population series exist in the same table without an explicit identifier, so the claim lacks context about which entity it refers to.

Assumptions made:
- I interpret the claim as referring to one of the population series in public.my_info_table. The table structure suggests alternating label/value rows, with the first 'population' row providing the 1602 and 1847 values cited. No specific location or entity is specified in the source data or the claim.
