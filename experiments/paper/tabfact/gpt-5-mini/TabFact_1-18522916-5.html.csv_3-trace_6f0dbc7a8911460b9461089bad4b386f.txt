Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the schema to locate relevant information about teams and outgoing managers in the Salvadoran Primera División Apertura 2008 dataset.
- Queried the table for Nejapa’s entries and checked whether any outgoing manager named Roberto Gamarra is associated with Nejapa.

Data sources and schema
- Data source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact", schema: public.
- Relevant table: primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
  - Columns: team (text), outgoing manager (text), manner of departure (text), date of vacancy (text), replaced by (text), date of appointment (text), position in table (text)

Evidence 1: Outgoing manager(s) for Nejapa
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE team ILIKE 'Nejapa';
- Result (two rows, summarized):
  1) team: nejapa | outgoing manager: mauricio cienfuegos | manner: mutual consent | vacancy: 14 august 2008 | replaced by: daniel uberti | appointment: 5 september 2008 | position: 10th
  2) team: nejapa | outgoing manager: daniel uberti | manner: sacked | vacancy: 29 december 2008 | replaced by: nelson ancheta | appointment: 29 december 2008 | position: post-season (10th)
- Interpretation: For Nejapa during the Apertura 2008 season and immediate post-season, the outgoing managers were Mauricio Cienfuegos (Aug 14, 2008) and Daniel Uberti (Dec 29, 2008). No entry shows Roberto Gamarra as Nejapa’s outgoing manager.

Evidence 2: Does any row list “Roberto Gamarra” as an outgoing manager, and for which team?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE "outgoing manager" ILIKE '%Gamarra%';
- Result (one row):
  team: balboa | outgoing manager: roberto gamarra | manner: mutual consent | vacancy: 1 january 2009 | replaced by: carlos de toro | appointment: 16 january 2009 | position: post-season (7th)
- Interpretation: Roberto Gamarra appears as the outgoing manager for Balboa (post-season), not for Nejapa.

Conclusion
- The available data contradicts the claim that “Roberto Gamarra [is] the outgoing manager of Nejapa.” In the dataset, Nejapa’s outgoing managers are Mauricio Cienfuegos and Daniel Uberti. Roberto Gamarra is listed as the outgoing manager for Balboa, not Nejapa.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the team Nejapa in the Salvadoran Primera División Apertura 2008 context represented by the available table.
- Interpreted “be the outgoing manager” as matching the table’s “outgoing manager” field.
- Treated the accessible TabFact dataset as authoritative for this verification window.
