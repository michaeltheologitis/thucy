What I checked
- Dataset explored: TabFact PostgreSQL, schema public, table public.ai_miyazato, which lists Ai Miyazato’s professional wins with fields for tournament, date, winning score, and to-par.

Evidence from data
- I searched for entries where the tournament name matches “Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open.” The table returned two wins by Ai Miyazato in this event with their final scores and to-par values.

Executed SQL and results
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, "winning score", "to par", "margin of victory" 
FROM public.ai_miyazato 
WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open%';

Results (date | tournament | winning score | to par | margin of victory):
1) 28 sep 2003 | miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open (as an amateur ) | 70 + 70 + 71 = 211 | - 5 | 1 stroke
2) 24 sep 2006 | miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open | 70 + 73 + 71 = 214 | - 2 | 3 strokes

Assessment
- The data shows that in 2006, the winner (Ai Miyazato) finished at 2-under par (−2), matching the claim.
- However, in 2003, a winner of the same event (also Ai Miyazato) finished at −5, showing the claim is not universally true across editions.

Conclusion
- The statement is accurate for the 2006 edition of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open. It is not a general property of the tournament’s winners across all years.

Assumptions
- I assumed the claim refers to a specific edition of the tournament rather than all editions, and interpreted it as referring to the 2006 result because the dataset shows an edition with −2 to-par. The only available authoritative data source lists Ai Miyazato’s wins; it does not enumerate non–Miyazato winners or all years of the event.
