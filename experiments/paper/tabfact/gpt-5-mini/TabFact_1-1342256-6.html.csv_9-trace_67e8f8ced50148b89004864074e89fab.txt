Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that, in the available data, the party associated with a record where the 'first elected' year is 1940 is Republican.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
- Relevant columns: party (text), "first elected" (text)

Step 1: Identify which parties have entries with "first elected" = 1940
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE "first elected" = '1940'
GROUP BY party
ORDER BY count DESC, party;

Result:
party      | count
-----------+------
republican | 1

Step 2: Inspect the actual row(s) with "first elected" = 1940
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE "first elected" = '1940';

Result (1 row):
- district: california 4
  incumbent: thomas rolph
  party: republican
  first elected: 1940
  result: re - elected

Conclusion: The only record with "first elected" equal to 1940 in this table has party = republican. Therefore, the claim that the party with first elected (year) 1940 is Republican is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to entries in the table public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 and asserting that records with 'first elected' = 1940 correspond to the Republican party. The table contains exactly one such record.
