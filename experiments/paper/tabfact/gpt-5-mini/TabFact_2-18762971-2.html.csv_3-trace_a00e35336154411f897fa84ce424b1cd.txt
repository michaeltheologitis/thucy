- Result: date: 14 april 2001; opponent: crystal palace; venue: h; result: 4 - 1; attendance: 19877.

- The match on 24 February 2001 was a loss (0–2 vs Preston North End).

Assumptions
- “Victory” and “loss” are interpreted from the result column as Sheffield Wednesday’s outcome (left number = Sheffield Wednesday goals, right number = opponent goals). The table represents the 2000–01 season of Sheffield Wednesday F.C., so the claim pertains to that team and season.
