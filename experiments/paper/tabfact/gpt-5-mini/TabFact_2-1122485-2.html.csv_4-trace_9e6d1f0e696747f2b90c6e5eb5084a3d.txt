Claim interpreted: “Any driver below 75 laps had trouble of some kind; thus no time is listed.” I verified this against the available data for the 1971 South African Grand Prix.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: TabFact database (postgres_tabfact18), schema public, table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.
- Table columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint).

Evidence
1) Full table contents
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;

Key observations from results:
- Finishers (laps ≥ 75): their “time / retired” values are race time or gaps (e.g., “1:47:35.5”, “+ 1 lap”, “+ 2 laps”, “+ 4 laps”).
- Non-finishers (laps < 75): their “time / retired” values are retirement reasons (e.g., engine, gearbox, accident, physical, overheating, differential, fuel leak, suspension) — not times.

2) Count and list of drivers with fewer than 75 laps
Summary:
- Number of drivers who completed fewer than 75 laps: 12
SQL used to produce this count:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_drivers_fewer_than_75 FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps < 75;
Result: 12

SQL used to produce the detailed list:
SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired" FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps < 75 ORDER BY laps DESC;
Result rows (driver — laps — time / retired):
- emerson fittipaldi — 58 — engine
- john surtees — 56 — gearbox
- françois cevert — 45 — accident
- howden ganley — 42 — physical
- pedro rodríguez — 33 — overheating
- dave charlton — 31 — engine
- jo siffert — 31 — overheating
- john love — 30 — differential
- jackie pretorius — 22 — engine
- peter gethin — 7 — fuel leak
- jo bonnier — 5 — suspension
- alex soler - roig — 5 — engine
All 12 entries list a retirement reason rather than a time.

3) Cross-check for laps ≥ 75 to contrast with finishers
Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps >= 75 ORDER BY laps DESC;
Results show times or lap-gap indicators only (e.g., “1:47:35.5”, “+ 20.9”, “+ 1 lap”, “+ 2 laps”, “+ 4 laps”).

Assessment
- “Any driver below 75 laps … thus no time listed”: Supported. For all 12 drivers with laps < 75, the “time / retired” field is a retirement reason (i.e., no race time or gap is listed).
- “Car trouble of some kind”: Mostly supported but not universally true. Of the 12 retirements, 10 are mechanical (engine, gearbox, overheating, differential, fuel leak, suspension), while 2 are non-mechanical: accident and physical. Therefore, not every sub-75-lap driver had “car trouble” specifically.

Conclusion: The dataset supports that all sub-75-lap drivers had trouble and no time was listed, but not all such trouble was “car trouble.”

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the 1971 South African Grand Prix, the only available race dataset in scope.
- “care trouble” was read as “trouble (mechanical or otherwise).” If interpreted strictly as “car trouble,” two entries (accident, physical) would not qualify as car trouble.
