Claim to verify
"There be over 3 time when the reader's vote be not n/a and the lifetime achievement be also na."

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact33 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.ned_kelly_awards
- Relevant columns: "reader 's vote" (text), "lifetime achievement" (text)

Schema confirmation
- Table ned_kelly_awards columns:
  - year — bigint
  - best teenage / young adult — text
  - reader 's vote — text
  - best non - fiction — text
  - lifetime achievement — text

How "N/A" is represented in data
- Distinct values show the dataset uses the literal text "na" (lowercase, no slash) to represent not applicable.

Evidence queries and results
1) Distinct values and frequencies for reader's vote
SQL executed:
SELECT "reader 's vote" AS readers_vote, COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY "reader 's vote"
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
Result:
- "na": 14
- "bleeding hearts by lindy cameron": 1
- "apartment 255 by bunty avieson": 1

2) Distinct values and frequencies for lifetime achievement
SQL executed:
SELECT COALESCE("lifetime achievement", '<NULL>') AS lifetime_achievement, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY COALESCE("lifetime achievement", '<NULL>')
ORDER BY freq DESC;
Result (top values):
- na: 3
- alan yates (aka carter brown ): 1
- peter corris: 1
- professor stephen knight: 1
- andrew rule and john silvester: 1
- shane maloney: 1
- sandra harvey and lindsay simpson: 1
- bob bottom: 1
- jon cleary: 1
- patrick gallagher: 1
- marele day: 1
- peter doyle: 1
- kerry greenwood: 1
- stuart coupe: 1
(No NULLs present for lifetime achievement.)

3) Count rows where reader's vote is not 'na'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_non_na
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(TRIM("reader 's vote")) <> 'na';
Result:
- count_non_na: 2

List those rows
SQL executed:
SELECT "year", "reader 's vote" AS reader_vote
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" IS NOT NULL
  AND LOWER(TRIM("reader 's vote")) <> 'na'
ORDER BY "year";
Result rows:
- 2001 — bleeding hearts by lindy cameron
- 2002 — apartment 255 by bunty avieson

4) Core verification: rows where reader's vote is not 'na' AND lifetime achievement is 'na'
SQL executed (robust to case/whitespace, excludes NULL/blank as not applicable):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_reader_not_na_lifetime_na
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("lifetime achievement",''))) = 'na'
  AND LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("reader 's vote",''))) <> 'na'
  AND LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("reader 's vote",''))) <> '' ;
Result:
- count_reader_not_na_lifetime_na: 0

Years for any such rows (for inspection)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "year" AS year
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("lifetime achievement",''))) = 'na'
  AND LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("reader 's vote",''))) <> 'na'
  AND LOWER(TRIM(COALESCE("reader 's vote",''))) <> ''
ORDER BY "year";
Result:
- No rows returned (consistent with count = 0)

Conclusion
- There are 0 occurrences where the reader's vote is not N/A (not 'na') and the lifetime achievement is 'na' in the same record. This is not "over 3"; it is zero. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user's "n / a" as the dataset's "na" literal.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to rows where both conditions are true simultaneously in the same record.
- Comparisons used case-insensitive, trimmed matching to be robust to incidental whitespace/case.
