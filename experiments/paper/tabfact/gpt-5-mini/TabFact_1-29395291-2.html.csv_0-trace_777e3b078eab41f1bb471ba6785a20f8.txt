- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13), schema: public.
- Relevant table discovered: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  - Columns: provider (text), country (text), "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" (bigint), "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" (bigint), "growth %" (double precision)

Schema verification
- Providers present include “vodafone”. This confirms the data contains Vodafone records.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT provider FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa ORDER BY provider;
  Result (excerpt): airtel, djezzy, glo mobile, maroc, mobilis, mobinil, mtn, vodacom, vodafone

Evidence queries and results
1) Retrieve Vodafone’s 2005 subscriber counts by country
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider = 'vodafone';
   Result:
   - country: egypt | subscribers (2005) (thousands): 6125

2) Compute the minimum 2005 subscriber value for Vodafone
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT MIN("subscribers (2005) (thousands)") AS min_subscribers_2005 FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider = 'vodafone';
   Result:
   - min_subscribers_2005: 6125

Conclusion
- The dataset contains a single Vodafone row (Egypt) with 2005 subscribers equal to 6125 (in thousands). Therefore, the minimum (fewest) 2005 subscriber count for Vodafone in the dataset is 6125.

Assumptions
- “Fewest number” is interpreted as the minimum across all rows for provider = 'vodafone' in the 2005 column.
- Units: The column is explicitly “subscribers (2005) (thousands)”; thus 6125 represents 6,125 thousand (i.e., 6.125 million).
