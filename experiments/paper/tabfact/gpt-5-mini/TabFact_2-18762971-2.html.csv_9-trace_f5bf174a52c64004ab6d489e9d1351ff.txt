Summary conclusion: The shortest time between two consecutive matches in March (for Sheffield Wednesday F.C., 2000–01 season) is 3 days, not 2 days.

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season.

Schema (queried via schema tool)
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Initial data inspection (to confirm date format)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
LIMIT 30;
Key observation: Dates are stored as text like "3 march 2001".

List all March 2001 fixtures (ordered) and confirm parsing
SQL executed:
SELECT to_char(to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'),'YYYY-MM-DD') AS parsed_date, opponent, venue, result
FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%march 2001%'
ORDER BY to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY');
Result:
- 2001-03-03 | gillingham | h | 2 - 1
- 2001-03-07 | portsmouth | h | 0 - 0
- 2001-03-10 | west bromwich albion | a | 2 - 1
- 2001-03-17 | burnley | h | 2 - 0
- 2001-03-24 | birmingham city | a | 2 - 1

Consecutive gaps within March 2001
SQL executed:
WITH march AS (
  SELECT to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')::date AS dt, date AS raw_date, opponent
  FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%2001%' AND (date ILIKE '%Mar%' OR date ILIKE '%March%')
)
SELECT prev_raw_date, prev_dt, raw_date AS curr_raw_date, dt AS curr_dt, (dt - prev_dt) AS days_diff
FROM (
  SELECT dt, raw_date, opponent, lag(dt) OVER (ORDER BY dt) as prev_dt, lag(raw_date) OVER (ORDER BY dt) as prev_raw_date
  FROM march
) t
WHERE prev_dt IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY dt;
Result:
- 3 march 2001 -> 7 march 2001 : 4 days
- 7 march 2001 -> 10 march 2001 : 3 days
- 10 march 2001 -> 17 march 2001 : 7 days
- 17 march 2001 -> 24 march 2001 : 7 days

Minimum difference (days) among those pairs
SQL executed:
WITH march AS (
  SELECT to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')::date AS dt, date AS raw_date
  FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%2001%' AND (date ILIKE '%Mar%' OR date ILIKE '%March%')
)
SELECT MIN(dt - prev_dt) AS min_diff
FROM (
  SELECT dt, lag(dt) OVER (ORDER BY dt) AS prev_dt
  FROM march
) s
WHERE prev_dt IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- min_diff: 3

Conclusion
- The shortest time between two consecutive March fixtures in this dataset is 3 days (between 7 March 2001 and 10 March 2001). The claim that it is 2 days is not supported.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity, stated explicitly):
- The claim refers to the only accessible relevant dataset: Sheffield Wednesday F.C. 2000–01 season (table public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season).
- “Consecutive match in March” is interpreted as consecutive matches whose dates fall in March 2001 within that season, and the gap is computed as the calendar day difference between their dates.
