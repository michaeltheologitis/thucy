Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and identified a single relevant table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement in the TabFact (postgres_tabfact1) database. This table maps Chinese unit characters to metric/imperial conversions.
- Verified whether 担/擔 appears and how many characters have a metric value explicitly expressed in kilograms ("kg").

Evidence from data
1) Direct lookup for exact characters 担 or 擔
SQL executed:
SELECT jyutping, "character", portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "character" IN ('担','擔');

Result: No rows returned.

Follow-up note: The table stores the entry as a combined form "担 / 擔" (with spaces and a slash), so the exact match above did not return a row.

2) Count how many distinct characters have a metric value containing the substring 'kg' (case-insensitive) and list them
SQL executed (list):
SELECT DISTINCT character, "metric value" FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '%kg%';

Result:
- character: 担 / 擔
  metric value: 60.478982 kg

SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT character) AS cnt FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '%kg%';

Result:
- cnt: 1

3) Full table listing for context
SQL executed:
SELECT "character", jyutping, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value"
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
ORDER BY "character";

Results (abridged to the columns shown):
- 兩 | loeng2 | tael | 1 / 16 | 37.79936375 g | ~1.3333oz
- 分 | fan1 | condorim | 1 / 1600 | 377.9936375 mg | ~0.2133 dr
- 厘 | lei4 | liz | 1 / 1600 | 37.79931 mg | ~0.2133 dr
- 斤 | gan1 | cate | 1 | 604.78982 g | ~1.3333lb
- 錢 | cin4 | maz | 1 / 160 | 3.779936375 g | ~2.1333dr
- 担 / 擔 | daam3 | pico | 100 | 60.478982 kg | ~133.3333lb

Findings
- Only one entry in the table has its metric value explicitly expressed in kilograms (“kg”): 担 / 擔, with 60.478982 kg.
- No other character in this dataset has the metric value field expressed with the unit “kg”; the other entries are expressed in grams (g) or milligrams (mg).

Conclusion
- The claim that “担 / 擔 [is] 1 of 3 character that have a metric value measure in kg” is not supported by the available data. In this dataset, there is exactly one character with a metric value expressed in kilograms, and it is 担 / 擔.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “have a metric value measure in kg” as the table’s metric value field explicitly containing the unit label “kg”.
- Verification is limited to the authoritative dataset available (public.chinese_units_of_measurement) discovered in the connected TabFact database.
