What I verified
- Claim: In the 2010 World Cup qualification, there was a match with score 2 - 1 and venue Seoul, South Korea.

Data discovery and schema
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database TabFact22 (public schema) with table: public.kwak_tae_hwi.
- Table columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text).

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Inspect all rows to see relevant matches and how values are stored
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi;
Returned rows (5):
- {competition: "2010 world cup qualification", date: "february 2 , 2008", result: "4 - 0", score: "1 - 0", venue: "seoul , south korea"}
- {competition: "2008 east asian cup", date: "february 17 , 2008", result: "3 - 2", score: "3 - 2", venue: "chongqing , china"}
- {competition: "2010 world cup qualification", date: "october 15 , 2008", result: "4 - 1", score: "4 - 1", venue: "seoul , south korea"}
- {competition: "friendly", date: "march 3 , 2010", result: "2 - 0", score: "2 - 0", venue: "london , england"}
- {competition: "2014 world cup qualification", date: "june 8 , 2012", result: "4 - 1", score: "2 - 1", venue: "doha , qatar"}

2) Directly test the claim (2010 World Cup qualification AND venue contains Seoul, South Korea AND score is 2-1)
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi
WHERE competition ILIKE '%2010 world cup qualification%'
  AND venue ILIKE '%seoul%'
  AND venue ILIKE '%south korea%'
  AND score ~ '2[[:space:]]*[-–—][[:space:]]*1';
Result: 0 rows (no matches).

Assessment
- The table lists two 2010 World Cup qualification matches in Seoul, South Korea (Feb 2, 2008 and Oct 15, 2008) with scores 1 - 0 and 4 - 1, respectively.
- A 2 - 1 score exists in the table, but it is for 2014 World Cup qualification in Doha, Qatar, not Seoul nor 2010 qualification.
- Therefore, the claim that a 2010 World Cup qualification match with score 2 - 1 took place in Seoul, South Korea is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the available entries.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate based on the retrieved data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “2010 world cup qualification” literally as appearing in the competition field (case-insensitive) and treated the venue field as needing to contain both “Seoul” and “South Korea.”
- I matched score “2 - 1” allowing for spaces and different dash characters.
