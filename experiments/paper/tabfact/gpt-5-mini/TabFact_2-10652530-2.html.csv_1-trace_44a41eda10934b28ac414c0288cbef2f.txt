Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema).
- Identified table: t_2004_cleveland_browns_season (one row per 2004 Cleveland Browns game, including date and attendance).

Relevant schema (public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season):
- week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), stadium (text), record (text), attendance (double precision)

Evidence query and result:
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, stadium, attendance
FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%October 17%' AND date ILIKE '%2004%';

Result:
- week: 6
- date: october 17 , 2004
- opponent: cincinnati bengals
- stadium: cleveland browns stadium
- attendance: 73263

Conclusion:
- The record for the game dated “october 17 , 2004” shows attendance = 73,263, which matches the claim that 73263 was the attendance for the game on October 17, 2004.

Assumptions:
- Date is stored as free-text; thus a case-insensitive substring match (ILIKE) for 'October 17' and '2004' was used to identify the row.
