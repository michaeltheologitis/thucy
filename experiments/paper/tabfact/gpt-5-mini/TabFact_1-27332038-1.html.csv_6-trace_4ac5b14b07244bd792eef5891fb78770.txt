Claim to verify: “the production code for see you next fall be 2arg01.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered one PostgreSQL source (postgres_tabfact18) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.modern_family_season_2 (contains title and production code columns).

Relevant schema (from inspection)
- Table: public.modern_family_season_2
  Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (double precision)

Evidence
1) Retrieve the production code for the episode titled “See You Next Fall”
Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "no in series", "production code" FROM public.modern_family_season_2 WHERE lower("title") = lower('See You Next Fall');
Result:
- title: see you next fall
- no in season: 23
- no in series: 47
- production code: 2arg24

2) Check what episode (if any) has production code “2ARG01” (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "production code"
FROM public.modern_family_season_2
WHERE lower("production code") = lower('2ARG01');
Result:
- title: earthquake
- no in season: 3
- production code: 2arg01

Assessment
- The database shows “See You Next Fall” has production code 2arg24, not 2ARG01.
- Production code 2ARG01 belongs to the episode “earthquake,” not “See You Next Fall.”

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “See You Next Fall” refers to the Modern Family Season 2 episode of that exact title (present in the modern_family_season_2 table).
