Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered one PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact1) with a single table in the public schema: t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team. This table includes columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

Evidence query and result:
- Objective: Verify whether “Allen” had the most points on November 17 with 12 points.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE date ILIKE '%November 17%' OR date ILIKE '%Nov%17%' OR date ILIKE '%Nov. 17%';
- Result returned:
  - date: november 17
    team: georgetown (19)
    score: l 46 - 45
    high points: allen - 12

Interpretation:
- The table records the team’s leading scorer for each game in the “high points” column in the format “player - points.” For the game on November 17, the “high points” entry is “allen - 12,” indicating that a player named Allen led the team in points with 12.
- Therefore, the claim that “Allen had the most points on November 17 with 12 points” is supported by the data in this dataset for the Temple Owls 2009–10 season.

Assumptions made:
- “Most point score” refers to the Temple Owls team’s leading scorer (not necessarily the highest scorer across both teams in the game).
- The date “november 17” in the dataset refers to the specific game date during the 2009–10 season captured by this table.
