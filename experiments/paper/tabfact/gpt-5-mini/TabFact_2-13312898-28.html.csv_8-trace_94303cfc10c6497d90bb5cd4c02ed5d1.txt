Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources and inspected the only accessible database and table.
- I then examined the table contents and ran targeted queries to count how many Running Back selections occurred by the end of Round 6.

Data source discovery
- Tool used: data source discovery
- Result: One database found: TabFact (schema: public) with table indianapolis_colts_draft_history.

Schema inspection
- Tool used: schema introspection
- Database: TabFact; Schema: public
- Table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history (columns: round bigint, pick bigint, overall bigint, name text, position text, college text)

Executed SQL evidence and results
1) Verify columns (no year present)
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='indianapolis_colts_draft_history' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result:
- round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)

2) Show all rows to understand positions by round
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history ORDER BY round, pick;
Result rows (ordered by round, pick):
- round: 1, pick: 5, overall: 5, name: curtis dickey, position: running back, college: texas a&m
- round: 1, pick: 24, overall: 24, name: derrick hatchett, position: cornerback, college: texas
- round: 2, pick: 4, overall: 32, name: ray donaldson, position: center, college: georgia
- round: 2, pick: 23, overall: 51, name: tim foley, position: offensive tackle, college: notre dame
- round: 4, pick: 5, overall: 88, name: ray butler, position: wide receiver, college: usc
- round: 6, pick: 6, overall: 144, name: chris foote, position: center, college: usc
- round: 7, pick: 5, overall: 170, name: wes roberts, position: defensive end, college: tcu
- round: 8, pick: 2, overall: 195, name: ken walter, position: offensive tackle, college: texas tech
- round: 9, pick: 6, overall: 227, name: mark bright, position: running back, college: temple
- round: 10, pick: 5, overall: 254, name: larry stewart, position: offensive tackle, college: maryland
- round: 11, pick: 3, overall: 280, name: ed whitley, position: tight end, college: kansas state
- round: 12, pick: 6, overall: 311, name: randy bielski, position: placekicker, college: towson
- round: 12, pick: 19, overall: 324, name: marvin sims, position: fullback, college: clemson

3) Count Running Back picks by the end of Round 6
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rb_count FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round <= 6 AND position = 'running back';
Result:
- rb_count = 1

4) List all Colts picks through Round 6 (to cross-check positions)
SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round <= 6 ORDER BY round, pick;
Result rows:
1) round=1, pick=5, overall=5, name=curtis dickey, position=running back, college=texas a&m
2) round=1, pick=24, overall=24, name=derrick hatchett, position=cornerback, college=texas
3) round=2, pick=4, overall=32, name=ray donaldson, position=center, college=georgia
4) round=2, pick=23, overall=51, name=tim foley, position=offensive tackle, college=notre dame
5) round=4, pick=5, overall=88, name=ray butler, position=wide receiver, college=usc
6) round=6, pick=6, overall=144, name=chris foote, position=center, college=usc

Conclusion
- The claim states that there were 3 running back position picks by the 6th round. The data shows exactly 1 Running Back selected by the end of Round 6 (Curtis Dickey in Round 1). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “run back position” as “running back”.
- Interpreted “by the 6th round” as inclusive of rounds 1 through 6.
- The table appears to represent a single draft class for the Indianapolis Colts, but no year column exists; verification is based solely on the rows present in this table.
