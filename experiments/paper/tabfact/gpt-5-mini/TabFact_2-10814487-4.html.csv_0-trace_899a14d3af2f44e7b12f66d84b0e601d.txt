Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a relevant sports results table in the TabFact PostgreSQL database.
- Queried the 2007 Bradford Bulls season table for the exact date 15 / 04 / 07 and verified the competition and score.

Data source
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
- Columns (relevant): date, home team, score, away team, competition

Evidence 1: Retrieve the match on 15 / 04 / 07
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", competition
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE date = '15 / 04 / 07';

Result:
- date: 15 / 04 / 07
- home team: bradford
- score: 52 - 22
- away team: hull kr
- competition: super league xii

Evidence 2: Confirm the competition matches “Super League XII”
SQL:
SELECT competition, lower(competition) = lower('Super League XII') AS competition_matches_super_league_xii
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE date = '15 / 04 / 07';

Result:
- competition: super league xii
- competition_matches_super_league_xii: true

Conclusion
- On 15 / 04 / 07 in Super League XII, Bradford vs Hull KR ended 52 - 22. This directly supports the claim that the score on 15/04/07 in Super League XII was 52 - 22.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Bradford Bulls fixture recorded for that date in Super League XII and does not assert uniqueness across all matches that day.
- Date string formatting is taken exactly as stored in the table (‘15 / 04 / 07’).
