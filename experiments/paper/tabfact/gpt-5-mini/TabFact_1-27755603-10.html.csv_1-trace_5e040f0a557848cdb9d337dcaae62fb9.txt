Claim to verify: “the detroit piston lose 6 game during this period of their 2010 - 2011 season.”

What data covers “this period”? The available table (public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season) contains a slice of the Pistons’ 2010–2011 season: games 62–73, dated March 1–26. Within this period, I counted wins and losses.

Key findings based on data:
- The Pistons recorded 8 losses and 4 wins in games 62–73 (March 1–26), not 6 losses.
- Loss games in this period occurred on: March 1, 2, 9, 11, 12, 20, 23, 25 (8 total).

Executed SQL evidence and results:
1) Establish the period and row count
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
  Result: total_rows = 12
- SQL: SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
  Result: min_game = 62
- SQL: SELECT MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
  Result: max_game = 73

2) Show distinct dates to characterize the period
- SQL: SELECT date FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY MIN(game);
  Result (ordered): march 1; march 2; march 6; march 9; march 11; march 12; march 16; march 18; march 20; march 23; march 25; march 26

3) Inspect the games and outcomes for games 62–73
- SQL: SELECT game, date, team, score FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE game BETWEEN 62 AND 73 ORDER BY game;
  Result (abbrev.):
  • 62, march 1, milwaukee, l 90 - 92 (ot)
  • 63, march 2, minnesota, l 105 - 116 (ot)
  • 64, march 6, washington, w 113 - 102 (ot)
  • 65, march 9, san antonio, l 104 - 111 (ot)
  • 66, march 11, oklahoma city, l 94 - 104 (ot)
  • 67, march 12, denver, l 101 - 131 (ot)
  • 68, march 16, toronto, w 107 - 93 (ot)
  • 69, march 18, new york, w 99 - 95 (ot)
  • 70, march 20, atlanta, l 96 - 104 (ot)
  • 71, march 23, miami, l 94 - 100 (ot)
  • 72, march 25, cleveland, l 91 - 97 (ot)
  • 73, march 26, miami, w 100 - 88 (ot)

4) Count wins and losses in this period
- SQL: SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN lower(substr(score,1,1))='w' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
    SUM(CASE WHEN lower(substr(score,1,1))='l' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE game BETWEEN 62 AND 73;
  Result: wins = 4, losses = 8

5) List only losses in this period (for clarity)
- SQL: SELECT game, date, team, score FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE game BETWEEN 62 AND 73 AND score ILIKE 'l %' ORDER BY game;
  Result:
  • Game 62 — march 1 — milwaukee — l 90 - 92 (ot)
  • Game 63 — march 2 — minnesota — l 105 - 116 (ot)
  • Game 65 — march 9 — san antonio — l 104 - 111 (ot)
  • Game 66 — march 11 — oklahoma city — l 94 - 104 (ot)
  • Game 67 — march 12 — denver — l 101 - 131 (ot)
  • Game 70 — march 20 — atlanta — l 96 - 104 (ot)
  • Game 71 — march 23 — miami — l 94 - 100 (ot)
  • Game 72 — march 25 — cleveland — l 91 - 97 (ot)

Conclusion: The data shows 8 losses in this period, not 6. Therefore, the claim is not supported.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity):
- “This period” refers to the period represented by the available table (games 62–73, dated March 1–26 of the 2010–2011 season).
- The first character of the score field indicates outcome: 'w' = win, 'l' = loss (as consistently reflected in the table).
