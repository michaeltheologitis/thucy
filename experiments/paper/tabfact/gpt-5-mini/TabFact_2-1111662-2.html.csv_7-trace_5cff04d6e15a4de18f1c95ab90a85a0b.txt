Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad are in the discus throw event.

Data sources discovered:
- TabFact (postgres_tabfact3) database with one relevant table: public.memorial_van_damme (columns: event, athlete, record, nationality, date).

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Check for entries containing either athlete’s name and see associated event
- SQL:
  SELECT athlete, event FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Whitbread%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Hattestad%';
- Result:
  [{"athlete":"fatima whitbread trine hattestad","event":"javelin throw"}]
- SQL (exact-match confirmation of stored value):
  SELECT athlete, event FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE athlete = 'fatima whitbread trine hattestad';
- Result:
  [{"athlete":"fatima whitbread trine hattestad","event":"javelin throw"}]

2) Find all discus throw entries and whether Whitbread or Hattestad appear there
- SQL:
  SELECT athlete, event, record, nationality, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE '%discus%';
- Result:
  athlete: tsvetanka christova; event: discus throw; record: 69.84 m; nationality: bulgaria; date: 5 september 1986
- SQL (restrict to Whitbread/Hattestad in discus):
  SELECT athlete, event, record, nationality, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE (athlete ILIKE '%Whitbread%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Hattestad%') AND event ILIKE '%discus%';
- Result:
  No rows matched.

3) Confirm javelin throw entries
- SQL:
  SELECT athlete, event FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE '%javelin%';
- Result:
  - athlete: fatima whitbread trine hattestad; event: javelin throw

Conclusion:
- The available data links “fatima whitbread trine hattestad” to the javelin throw, not the discus throw. The only discus throw entry in this dataset is Tsvetanka Christova. Therefore, the claim that Fatima Whitbread and Trine Hattestad are in the discus throw event is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted as an assertion about athlete-event association as recorded in the Memorial Van Damme dataset available in TabFact. Matches used case-insensitive substring search where appropriate.
