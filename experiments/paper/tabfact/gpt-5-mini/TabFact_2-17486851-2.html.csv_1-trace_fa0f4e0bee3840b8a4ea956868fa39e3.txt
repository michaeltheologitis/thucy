Claim to verify: “for the nat por, it be a mutual consent loan return, and the transfer fee be free.” Interpreted as: In the available transfer dataset, the record(s) with nat = 'por' have type = 'mutual consent loan return' and transfer fee = 'free'.

Data discovery and schema grounding:
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database postgres_tabfact33 (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  - Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text), source (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Identify whether there are any rows with nat = 'por' and how many
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS count_rows
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  GROUP BY nat
  ORDER BY nat ASC NULLS LAST;
- Result (excerpt relevant to the claim): por: 1 row.

2) Retrieve the row(s) where nat = 'por' and inspect type and transfer fee
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'por';
- Result (1 row):
  - nat: por
  - name: paulo costa
  - moving to: anorthosis famagusta
  - type: mutual consent loan return
  - transfer window: winter
  - transfer fee: free
  - source: apoelfccomcy

Assessment:
- The single row with nat = 'por' has type = “mutual consent loan return” and transfer fee = “free,” exactly matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season table in the available database and to the nat code “por” as shown in this dataset.
