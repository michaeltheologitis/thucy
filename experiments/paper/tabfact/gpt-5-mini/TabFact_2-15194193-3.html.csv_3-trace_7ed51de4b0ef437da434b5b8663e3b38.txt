Claim interpreted: “Alberto Pagani average 40 point in race he win.”
Working interpretation: The dataset available contains season/class/team rows for Alberto Pagani with total season points and number of wins. I interpret the claim as: “Across the seasons (rows) where Alberto Pagani recorded at least one win, his average points (for those rows) is 40.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.alberto_pagani(year, class, team, points, wins)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Row count (to understand dataset scope)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Result:
- total_rows = 29

2) Average of points for rows where wins > 0 (directly tests the claim)
SQL:
SELECT AVG(points) AS avg_points_wins_gt_0 FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
Result:
- avg_points_wins_gt_0 = 40.0

3) List the rows where wins > 0 (to show the contributing seasons)
SQL:
SELECT year, class, team, points, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1969 | 500cc | linto     | points = 15 | wins = 1
- 1971 | 500cc | linto     | points = 29 | wins = 1
- 1971 | 500cc | mv agusta | points = 29 | wins = 1
- 1972 | 500cc | mv agusta | points = 87 | wins = 1
Computation check: (15 + 29 + 29 + 87) / 4 = 160 / 4 = 40.0

Conclusion
- The data show that across all seasons/classes where Alberto Pagani had at least one win, his average points total for those rows is exactly 40.0. This supports the claim under the stated interpretation.

Assumptions
- “race he win” is interpreted as “season entries (year/class/team rows) where he recorded at least one race win,” and “average 40 point” refers to the average of the season points across those winning-entry rows. The table does not contain per-race points, so per-race averages cannot be computed directly from this dataset.
