Claim to verify: "player austin daye (16) score the highest number of point in the game and the team be dallas"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL connector postgres_tabfact11, schema public.
- Table found: t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (2010–11 Detroit Pistons season game log with per-game leaders).

Relevant schema (summarized):
- Columns include: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), "high points" (text), "high rebounds" (text), "high assists" (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text). The "high points" field stores the leading scorer entry for the game as text (e.g., "player name (points)").

Evidence from data:
1) Retrieve all games where the opponent/team contains "Dallas" and show the leading scorer.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE team ILIKE '%Dallas%';
- Result:
  date: october 13 | team: dallas | score: l 96 - 101 (ot) | high points: austin daye (16)

2) Check how many games vs Dallas exist in this table and list the leaders for each.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_dallas_games FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "team" ILIKE '%Dallas%';
- Result: { count_dallas_games: 1 }
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "game", "date", "team", "score", "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "team" ILIKE '%Dallas%' ORDER BY "game";
- Result: { game: 4, date: "october 13", team: "dallas", score: "l 96 - 101 (ot)", high points: "austin daye (16)" }

Assessment:
- The dataset records a game against Dallas with the "high points" entry listed as "austin daye (16)", which supports the claim that Austin Daye scored 16 and was the game’s recorded high points entry for that matchup. The team value for that row is "dallas", satisfying the team condition.

Conclusion: The data directly supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions:
- "high points" in this table denotes the leading scorer entry as recorded for the Pistons’ game log (commonly the Pistons’ leading scorer for that game). The claim’s phrasing "highest number of point in the game" is interpreted in line with this column’s meaning in the dataset.
