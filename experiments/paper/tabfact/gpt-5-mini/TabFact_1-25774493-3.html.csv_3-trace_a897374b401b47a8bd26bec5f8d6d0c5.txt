Claim to verify: "there be 24.8 point per game in the selection where rebound per game be 17"

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), schema: public
- Table: list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
  - Columns: selection (bigint), month (text), season (text), team record (text), points per game (text), field goal percentage (text), rebounds per game (text), blocks per game (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Check if any row has rebounds per game = 17 (treating the text as a number)
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT count(*) AS cnt
     FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
     WHERE trim("rebounds per game") ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
       AND ("rebounds per game")::numeric = 17;
   - Result: cnt = 0 (no rows)

2) Enumerate selections with points per game and rebounds per game to inspect values
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT selection, season, "points per game", "rebounds per game"
     FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
     ORDER BY selection ASC;
   - Returned rows:
     - selection: 1, season: 2005 - 06 (1 / 1), points per game: 18.1, rebounds per game: 14.0
     - selection: 2, season: 2006 - 07 (1 / 1), points per game: 17.1, rebounds per game: 13.6
     - selection: 3, season: 2007 - 08 (1 / 2), points per game: 23.8, rebounds per game: 15.0
     - selection: 4, season: 2007 - 08 (2 / 2), points per game: 21.7, rebounds per game: 16.1
     - selection: 5, season: 2010 - 11 (1 / 2), points per game: 21.8 (5th), rebounds per game: 12.1 (4th in league)
   - Observation: No row has rebounds per game = 17, nor points per game = 24.8.

3) Explicitly test for any row with points per game = 24.8
   - Executed SQL (numeric comparison after cleaning text):
     SELECT selection, season, "points per game", "rebounds per game"
     FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
     WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace("points per game", '[^0-9\.\-]', '', 'g'), '')::numeric = 24.8;
   - Result: no rows
   - Executed SQL (text contains '24.8'):
     SELECT selection, season, "points per game", "rebounds per game"
     FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
     WHERE "points per game" ILIKE '%24.8%';
   - Result: no rows

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains no selection where rebounds per game equals 17, and no entry with points per game equal to 24.8. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "selection" as the selection column in the table list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard.
- Interpreted "rebound per game be 17" as a numeric value of 17.0 for the rebounds per game field, comparing numerically after validating and casting the text column.
