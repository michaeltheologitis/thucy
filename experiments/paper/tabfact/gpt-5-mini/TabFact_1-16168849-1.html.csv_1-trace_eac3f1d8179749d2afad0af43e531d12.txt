Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a relevant table containing college team nicknames and conference join years.
- Queried the table to find the institution with the nickname “Blue Hose” and retrieved its recorded conference join year.

Data source discovery:
- Source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26), schema: public
- Relevant table: north_state_conference — columns include institution, nickname, joined, left, current conference, etc.

Executed SQL and evidence:
1) SQL:
SELECT institution, nickname, joined FROM north_state_conference WHERE nickname ILIKE '%blue%';

Result:
- institution: presbyterian college
- nickname: blue hose
- joined: 1965

Assessment:
- The table shows the team with the nickname “Blue Hose” is Presbyterian College and the recorded conference join year is 1965. This directly supports the claim that the college team whose nickname is Blue Hose joined the conference in 1965.

Assumptions:
- “Blue Hose” refers to Presbyterian College’s teams (the only commonly known program with this nickname in the dataset).
- The “joined” field in north_state_conference denotes the year the institution joined that conference context captured by the table.
- The claim refers to the same conference context represented by the north_state_conference table.
