Evidence from executed SQL
1) Locate episodes with titles like "Fast Friend(s)"
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "original air date" FROM full_house_season_7 WHERE title ILIKE '%Fast Friend%';
Result:

2) Neighboring episodes for context (season numbering)

SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "original air date" FROM full_house_season_7 WHERE "no in season" IN (4,6) ORDER BY "no in season";
Result:

Conclusion
- The table full_house_season_7 contains an episode titled "fast friends" (plural) with an original air date of "october 12 , 1993". This matches the date in the claim. The only discrepancy is that the claim uses the singular "friend"; the data shows the title as "Fast Friends". The air date is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "fast friend" as the Full House Season 7 episode "Fast Friends".
- Treated the claim as concerning the episode’s original air date rather than exact title casing/pluralization.
