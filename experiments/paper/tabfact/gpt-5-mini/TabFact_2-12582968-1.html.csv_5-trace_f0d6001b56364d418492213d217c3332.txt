WHERE position IN ('1st','2nd','3rd')
ORDER BY year;

Analysis
- The dataset lists two Olympic entries (2008 Beijing: 29th; 2012 London: 6th). Neither indicates a medal.
- The table uses ‘3rd’ to denote a podium finish for other competitions (e.g., 2013 World Championships), confirming that an Olympic medal would be visible under this detection method if present.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data, Lukáš Melich did not win a medal at the Olympic Games.

Assumptions
- Olympic participations are identified via competition values containing “Olympic” (case-insensitive match).
- The TabFact table public.luk_melich accurately represents Lukáš Melich’s major competition results, including Olympics.
