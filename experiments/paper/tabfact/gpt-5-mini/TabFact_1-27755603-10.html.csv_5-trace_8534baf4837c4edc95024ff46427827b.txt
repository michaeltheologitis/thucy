Data sources discovered and schema
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17), public schema
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season with columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record

Step 1: Confirm the period covered by the available data
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
- Result: total_rows = 12
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season ORDER BY game;
- Result (games 62–73, March 1–26, 2011):
  • 62 | march 1  | milwaukee | l 90 - 92 (ot)     | high points: rodney stuckey (25)

  • 73 | march 26 | indiana    | w 100 - 88 (ot)    | high points: richard hamilton (23)

Step 2: Count games where Rodney Stuckey led the Pistons in points during this period
- SQL executed (case-insensitive match for Stuckey in the "high points" text):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_stuckey FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Stuckey%';
- Result: {"count_stuckey": 2}

Step 3: List the specific games
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Stuckey%' ORDER BY game;
- Result:
  • game 62 (march 1 vs. Milwaukee): high points = rodney stuckey (25)
  • game 70 (march 20 vs. Atlanta): high points = rodney stuckey (22)

Conclusion
- During the period represented by the available data (games 62–73 of the 2010–11 season, March 1–26, 2011), Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points in 2 games, not only 1.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “this period” as the period covered by the available table (games 62–73, March 2011). If a different date window was intended, please note the database at hand only contains these 12 games for the 2010–11 Pistons.
