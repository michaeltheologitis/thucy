Claim interpreted: The TV show “Gary Unmarried” comes on Friday at 8:00 pm.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact32), public schema.
- Relevant table identified: gary_unmarried (episode text, air date text, timeslot text, "18 - 49" text, viewers double precision).

Schema confirmation
- Tool confirmed exactly one table relevant to this show: gary_unmarried.

Evidence
1) Distinct timeslots and episode counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT timeslot, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM gary_unmarried
GROUP BY timeslot
ORDER BY episode_count DESC NULLS LAST, timeslot;
Result:
- timeslot: "wednesday 8:30 pm" — episode_count: 20

2) Sample episodes to verify formatting and consistency
Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot
FROM gary_unmarried
ORDER BY "air date"
LIMIT 10;
Results (abbrev.): All samples show timeslot = "wednesday 8:30 pm" (e.g., "gary and the trophy", air date: "april 8 , 2009").

3) Direct check for any “Friday” or “8:00 pm” entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE timeslot ILIKE '%friday%') AS friday_count,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE timeslot ILIKE '%8:00 pm%') AS eight_pm_count,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE timeslot ILIKE '%8:00%') AS eight_colon_count
FROM gary_unmarried;
Result:
- friday_count = 0, eight_pm_count = 0, eight_colon_count = 0

Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT timeslot FROM gary_unmarried WHERE timeslot ILIKE '%friday%' OR timeslot ILIKE '%8:00%';
Result: no rows returned.

4) Coverage check (row count and air date strings)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM gary_unmarried;
Result: total_episodes = 20

Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN("air date") AS min_air_date, MAX("air date") AS max_air_date FROM gary_unmarried;
Result (lexicographic on text): min_air_date = "april 8 , 2009"; max_air_date = "september 24 , 2008"

Conclusion
- The dataset shows a single timeslot for “Gary Unmarried”: Wednesday 8:30 pm. There are zero occurrences of Friday or 8:00 pm in the timeslot field. Therefore, the claim that it comes on Friday at 8:00 pm is not supported by the available data and is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user statement as a claim about the airing day/time of the TV show “Gary Unmarried.”
- Treated the provided TabFact dataset as authoritative within the scope accessible here.
