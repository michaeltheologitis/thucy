Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “Denni Neufeld [is] listed as a second for Winnipeg.” I verify whether Denni Neufeld is recorded as the curling position “second” on a Winnipeg team in the available data.

Data sources discovered
- Available database: TabFact (Postgres)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials (columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city)

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve all rows to inspect Winnipeg teams and player positions
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials;
Result (excerpt of Winnipeg rows):
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"garth smith","second":"richard daneault","skip":"kerry burtnyk","third / vice skip":"don walchuk"}
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"steve gould","second":"rob fowler","skip":"jeff stoughton","third / vice skip":"kevin park"}
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"denni neufeld","second":"matt wozniak","skip":"mike mcewen","third / vice skip":"b j neufeld"}

2) Explicitly filter for Winnipeg rows or any occurrence of the surname “Neufeld” to confirm Denni’s listed position
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE city ILIKE 'Winnipeg'
   OR "skip" ILIKE '%Neufeld%'
   OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Neufeld%'
   OR "second" ILIKE '%Neufeld%'
   OR "lead" ILIKE '%Neufeld%';
Result:
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"garth smith","second":"richard daneault","skip":"kerry burtnyk","third / vice skip":"don walchuk"}
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"steve gould","second":"rob fowler","skip":"jeff stoughton","third / vice skip":"kevin park"}
- {"city":"winnipeg","lead":"denni neufeld","second":"matt wozniak","skip":"mike mcewen","third / vice skip":"b j neufeld"}

Conclusion based on evidence
- In the Winnipeg team that includes Denni Neufeld (skip: Mike McEwen), Denni Neufeld is listed as lead, not second. The second on that team is Matt Wozniak. No Winnipeg row lists Denni Neufeld as second in this dataset.

Final determination: The claim that Denni Neufeld is listed as a second for Winnipeg is contradicted by the data shown above.

Assumptions made
- “Second” refers to the curling position column named “second.”
- “Winnipeg” refers to the city field and thus teams from Winnipeg in the 2009 Canadian Olympic curling trials table, which is the only relevant table available in the discovered data.
