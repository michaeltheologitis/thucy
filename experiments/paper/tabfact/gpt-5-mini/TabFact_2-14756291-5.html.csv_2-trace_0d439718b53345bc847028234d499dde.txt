Claim to verify: “George Town is the NTFA Div 1 team that has 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws.”

Data sources checked
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact27)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table
- Relevant columns: "ntfa div 1" (team name), wins, draws, byes, losses, against

Evidence from database queries
1) Teams with exactly 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws
SQL executed:
SELECT "ntfa div 1", wins, draws
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE wins = 8 AND draws < 2;
Result:
- ntfa div 1: scottsdale, wins: 8, draws: 0
Interpretation: The team matching 8 wins and <2 draws is Scottsdale, not George Town.

2) George Town’s actual wins and draws (name variants included)
SQL executed:
SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team, wins, draws
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "ntfa div 1" ILIKE '%george town%'
   OR "ntfa div 1" ILIKE '%georgetown%';
Result:
- team: george town, wins: 9, draws: 1
Interpretation: George Town has 9 wins and 1 draw. While the “fewer than 2 draws” condition holds (1 < 2), the wins count (9) does not match the claimed 8.

3) Direct check: Does George Town have exactly 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws?
SQL executed:
SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team, wins, draws
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower("ntfa div 1") = lower('George Town')
  AND wins = 8
  AND draws < 2;
Result: no rows returned.

For completeness, George Town’s record via exact name match
SQL executed:
SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team, wins, draws
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower("ntfa div 1") = lower('George Town');
Result:
- team: george town, wins: 9, draws: 1

Conclusion
- The claim is incorrect. The team with 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws is Scottsdale, not George Town. George Town has 9 wins and 1 draw.

Assumptions
- Team name comparisons were done case-insensitively and allowed common variants (e.g., “george town” vs. “Georgetown”).
- “Less than 2 draws” was interpreted as draws < 2.
- The column "ntfa div 1" stores the team names for the NTFA Division 1 standings represented in this table.
