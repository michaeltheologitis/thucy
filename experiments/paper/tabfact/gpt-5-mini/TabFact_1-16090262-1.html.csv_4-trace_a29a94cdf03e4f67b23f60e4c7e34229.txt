Evidence 1: Retrieve Season 7, Episode 11
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", "title", "directed by", "written by", "originalairdate", "tv broadcast"

WHERE "no in season" = 11;

Result:
- no in season: 4
- title: the engagement ring

Assessment
- Season 7 Episode 11 is titled “city under siege,” not “The Engagement Ring.”
- “The Engagement Ring” exists in Season 7 but as Episode 4, not Episode 11.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The query refers to the only available Season 7 dataset in our environment: Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (2003) Season 7.
- The claim was interpreted as asserting that Season 7, Episode 11 has the title “The Engagement Ring.”
