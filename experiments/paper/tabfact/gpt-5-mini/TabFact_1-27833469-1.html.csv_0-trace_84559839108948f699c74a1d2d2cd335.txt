Evidence from data (all queries are executed against the TabFact database, table public.will_grace_season_5):

1) Search for an episode title containing both "sex" and "videotape", and show title, season, and director
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, season, "directed by" FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE title ILIKE '%sex%' AND title ILIKE '%videotape%';
- Result:
  • title: sex , losers , and videotape
  • season: 19
  • directed by: james burrows

2) Retrieve the full row for the exact episode title
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE title = 'sex , losers , and videotape';
- Result (single row):
  • series: 110
  • season: 19
  • title: sex , losers , and videotape
  • directed by: james burrows
  • written by: steve gabriel
  • original air date: april 3 , 2003
  • us viewers (millions): 15

Interpretation:
- The dataset shows that the episode titled "sex , losers , and videotape" is directed by James Burrows and is labeled with season = 19. In the context of this table (which contains Will & Grace Season 5), the "season" column corresponds to the episode number within that season, making this Will & Grace Season 5, Episode 19.

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to the TV series represented by the accessible dataset (Will & Grace). The "season" field in the table reflects the episode number within Season 5; thus, "season 19" in the data corresponds to Episode 19 of Season 5. The core point being verified is the director credit for the episode titled "sex , losers , and videotape".
