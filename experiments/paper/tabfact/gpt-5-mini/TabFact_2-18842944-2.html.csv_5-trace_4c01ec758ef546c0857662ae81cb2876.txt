Data sources discovered
- Available database: postgres_tabfact33, schema public
- Relevant table: t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint)

Evidence from the data
1) Inspect all rows to confirm date formats and identify November/December games
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Result (excerpt showing Nov/Dec):
- week 9:  "november 7 , 1976"  — new england patriots
- week 10: "november 15 , 1976" — dallas cowboys
- week 11: "november 21 , 1976" — san diego chargers
- week 12: "november 25 , 1976" — detroit lions
- week 13: "december 5 , 1976"  — miami dolphins
- week 14: "december 12 , 1976" — baltimore colts

2) Count November games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nov_1976_games
FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season
WHERE lower(trim(date)) LIKE 'november%';
Result: 4

3) Count December games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS december_games FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'december%';
Result: 2

4) Count total games in November or December (combined)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_nov_dec
FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'november %' OR lower(date) LIKE 'december %';
Result: 6

Finding
- November has 4 games; December has 2 games; together, November–December has 6 games, not 2.

Conclusion
- The claim that there are 2 games in November–December is not supported by the data in the available season table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season) and to the total number of games across November and December combined.
- Month identification used a case-insensitive prefix match on the text-based date column.
