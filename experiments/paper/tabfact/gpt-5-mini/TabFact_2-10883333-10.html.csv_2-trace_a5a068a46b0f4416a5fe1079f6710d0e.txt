Summary
- Interpreted claim within the available data: compare Fitzroy’s and Footscray’s scores recorded in the accessible VFL dataset. The dataset shows matches dated 7 June 1975, with one game involving Fitzroy and one involving Footscray. I extracted the total points (the number in parentheses) from each score and compared them.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact8) with a public schema was accessible.

Schema overview
- Tool: schema_query
- Table: public.t_1975_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
- Inferred content domain: VFL match results (scores in format goals.behinds (total points)).

Score format validation (evidence)
- SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date" FROM t_1975_vfl_season LIMIT 5;
- Observed examples: e.g., "15.7 (97)" meaning total points = 97.

Team name validation (evidence)
- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" FROM t_1975_vfl_season ORDER BY 1;
- Result includes: fitzroy, footscray (team names appear lowercase in this table).

Extract Fitzroy and Footscray scores with parsed total points (evidence)
- SQL executed:
SELECT date,
       CASE WHEN "home team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray') THEN 'home' ELSE 'away' END AS side,
       CASE WHEN "home team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray') THEN "home team" ELSE "away team" END AS team,
       CASE WHEN "home team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray') THEN "home team score" ELSE "away team score" END AS score_text,
       CAST(trim(trailing ')' from split_part(CASE WHEN "home team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray') THEN "home team score" ELSE "away team score" END, '(', 2)) AS integer) AS total_points
FROM t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray')
   OR "away team" IN ('fitzroy','footscray')
ORDER BY date, team;
- Result used:
  - 7 june 1975 — fitzroy — 97
  - 7 june 1975 — footscray — 89

Aggregate confirmation (evidence)
- Fitzroy total points across all rows in this table
SQL executed:
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM((replace(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', ''))::int) FILTER (WHERE "home team" = 'fitzroy'),0)
  + COALESCE(SUM((replace(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', ''))::int) FILTER (WHERE "away team" = 'fitzroy'),0) AS fitzroy_total_points
FROM t_1975_vfl_season;
- Result: fitzroy_total_points = 97

- Footscray total points across all rows in this table
SQL executed:
SELECT
  COALESCE(SUM((replace(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', ''))::int) FILTER (WHERE "home team" = 'footscray'),0)
  + COALESCE(SUM((replace(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', ''))::int) FILTER (WHERE "away team" = 'footscray'),0) AS footscray_total_points
FROM t_1975_vfl_season;
- Result: footscray_total_points = 89

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset, Fitzroy’s recorded score (97) is higher than Footscray’s recorded score (89). The claim “fitzroy have a higher score than footscray” is supported by the evidence in this data.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted relative to the available dataset (t_1975_vfl_season). Team names are matched exactly as stored (lowercase). Scores are compared using the total points value inside parentheses in the score text. No assumption is made about other seasons or matches beyond what is present in the database.
