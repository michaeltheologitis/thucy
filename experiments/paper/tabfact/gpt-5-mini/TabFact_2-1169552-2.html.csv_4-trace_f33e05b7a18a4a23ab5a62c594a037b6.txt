Claim interpreted: “15 of the Eagle class were made but 0 are preserved.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered one available data source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact, schema: public) with a table named locomotives_of_the_southern_railway.
- Table columns include: class, wheel arrangement, manufacturer, year made, quantity made, quantity preserved, year (s) withdrawn.

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT class, "quantity made", "quantity preserved" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE class ILIKE '%Eagle%';
- Result returned:
  - class: eagle
  - quantity made: 3
  - quantity preserved: 0

Assessment of the claim against the data:
- Quantity made: The claim states 15; the data shows 3. This contradicts the claim.
- Quantity preserved: The claim states 0; the data shows 0. This supports the claim.

Conclusion: The statement is a mix of true and false elements. The preserved count is correct, but the made count is incorrect by a substantial margin.

Assumptions made:
- “Eagle class” refers to the entry labeled “eagle” in the locomotives_of_the_southern_railway table.
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing as referring to counts “made” and “preserved” for that class.
