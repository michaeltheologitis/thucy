3) Direct check: any Footscray vs Fitzroy game in this dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE ("home team" = 'footscray' AND "away team" = 'fitzroy') OR ("home team" = 'fitzroy' AND "away team" = 'footscray');
Result:
[{"count":0}]

4) Which game(s) were at Windy Hill?
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", venue, date FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Windy Hill%' ORDER BY date ASC;
Result:
[{"home team":"essendon","away team":"geelong","venue":"windy hill","date":"23 june 1962"}]

Findings
- In the available VFL data (public.t_1962_vfl_season), there is no match where Footscray played Fitzroy at all, and the only game at Windy Hill is Essendon vs Geelong on 23 June 1962.
- On that same date, Fitzroy played Collingwood at Victoria Park and Footscray played Carlton at Princes Park, not each other and not at Windy Hill.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data and is contradicted for the events covered by the accessible dataset.

Assumptions
- Due to the accessible data containing only the public.t_1962_vfl_season table (six matches from 23 June 1962), I interpreted the claim within the scope of this dataset. Team names are matched in lowercase as stored (e.g., 'footscray', 'fitzroy').
