Summary
- Claim: “only 3 of the project have be complete so far.”
- Interpretation: In the available dataset (public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi), projects are represented by Superfund sites, and “complete” is indicated by having a concrete value (a date) in the “construction completed” column rather than a placeholder.
- Finding: 3 records have an actual completion date; 6 have a placeholder “-”. This supports the claim.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact30), public schema available.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Relevant table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  - Columns: cerclis id (text), name (text), county (text), proposed (text), listed (text), construction completed (text), partially deleted (text), deleted (text)
  - No FKs/PKs reported.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Total records in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi;
Result: total_records = 9

2) Distinct values in “construction completed” to understand placeholders
SQL:
SELECT "construction completed", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
GROUP BY "construction completed"
ORDER BY "construction completed";
Results:
- "-": 6
- "08 / 08 / 1997": 1
- "09 / 17 / 1993": 1
- "12 / 30 / 1982": 1

3) Count of entries with an actual completion date (exclude NULL/empty/‘-’)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS completed_date_count FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE "construction completed" IS NOT NULL AND trim("construction completed") <> '' AND trim("construction completed") <> '-';
Result: completed_date_count = 3

4) Count of entries with the placeholder ‘-’ (not completed)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS dash_count FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE trim("construction completed") = '-';
Result: dash_count = 6

Conclusion
- Out of 9 total projects (sites), 3 show concrete completion dates and 6 show a placeholder ‘-’. Therefore, only 3 have been completed so far, consistent with the claim.

Assumptions
- “Projects” refers to the Superfund sites in the table public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi.
- A value of ‘-’ in “construction completed” indicates “not completed yet,” while any non-empty, non-‘-’ value indicates completion (typically a date).
- “So far” is interpreted as “as reflected in the current snapshot of this dataset.”
