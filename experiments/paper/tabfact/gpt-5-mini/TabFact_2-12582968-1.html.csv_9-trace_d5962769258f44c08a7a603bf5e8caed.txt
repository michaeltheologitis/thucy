Claim to verify: “Lukáš Melich never threw greater than 78 m.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.luk_melich with columns: year, competition, venue, position, notes (notes contains the performance mark in meters)

Step 1: Inspect available data for Lukáš Melich
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.luk_melich;
Results (year | competition | venue | position | notes):
- 1998 | world junior championships | annecy , france | 10th | 61.51 m
- 1999 | european junior championships | riga , latvia | 5th | 64.20 m
- 2001 | european u23 championships | amsterdam , netherlands | 11th | 66.41 m
- 2003 | universiade | daegu , south korea | 4th | 71.26 m
- 2005 | world championships | helsinki , finland | 14th | 74.53 m
- 2006 | european championships | gothenburg , sweden | 15th | 73.77 m
- 2008 | olympic games | beijing , pr china | 29th | 70.56 m
- 2009 | world championships | berlin , germany | 14th | 74.47 m
- 2012 | olympic games | london , great britain | 6th | 77.17 m
- 2013 | world championships | moscow , russia | 3rd | 79.36 m

Step 2: Extract numeric marks and check for any throws > 78.00 m
Executed SQL (list rows > 78.00 m):
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes, (regexp_replace(notes, '.*?([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\s*m.*', '\\1'))::numeric AS mark_m
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE (regexp_replace(notes, '.*?([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\s*m.*', '\\1'))::numeric > 78.00
ORDER BY mark_m DESC;
Result:
- 2013 | world championships | moscow , russia | 3rd | 79.36 m | mark_m: 79.36

Executed SQL (count > 78.00 m):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_over_78
FROM (
  SELECT (regexp_replace(notes, '.*?([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\s*m.*', '\\1'))::numeric AS mark_m
  FROM public.luk_melich
) t
WHERE mark_m > 78.00;
Result:
- count_over_78: 1

Executed SQL (best mark):
SELECT MAX((regexp_replace(notes, '.*?([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?)\s*m.*', '\\1'))::numeric) AS best_mark_m
FROM public.luk_melich;
Result:
- best_mark_m: 79.36

Conclusion
- The data shows Lukáš Melich threw 79.36 m at the 2013 World Championships in Moscow, which is greater than 78 m. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The "notes" field reliably encodes the distance in meters as a numeric value followed by the letter "m" (e.g., "79.36 m").
- The public.luk_melich table represents authoritative performance records for Lukáš Melich.
