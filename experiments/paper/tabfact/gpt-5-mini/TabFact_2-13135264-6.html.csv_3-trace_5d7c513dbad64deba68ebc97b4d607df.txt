Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact6)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), attendance (bigint), plus game details

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Maximum attendance value
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: max_attendance = 20066
- Finding: The highest attendance is 20066.

2) Rows (and dates) with the maximum attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT date, attendance, visitor, score, home, decision, record
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season)
  ORDER BY date;
- Result rows (date | attendance | visitor | score | home | decision | record):
  • january 14 | 20066 | chicago    | 2 - 4 | detroit | legace | 27 - 13 - 4 - 2
  • january 16 | 20066 | phoenix    | 3 - 3 | detroit | joseph | 27 - 13 - 5 - 2
  • january 29 | 20066 | new jersey | 2 - 5 | detroit | joseph | 29 - 15 - 7 - 2
  • january 3  | 20066 | anaheim    | 1 - 3 | detroit | legace | 25 - 12 - 4 - 1
  • january 31 | 20066 | carolina   | 4 - 4 | detroit | legace | 30 - 15 - 8 - 2
  • january 5  | 20066 | nashville  | 0 - 6 | detroit | joseph | 26 - 12 - 4 - 1
  • january 7  | 20066 | boston     | 3 - 0 | detroit | joseph | 26 - 13 - 4 - 1
- Finding: The maximum attendance (20066) occurred on 7 dates: january 3, january 5, january 7, january 14, january 16, january 29, january 31.

3) Count of dates with the maximum attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_dates_with_max
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);
- Result: num_dates_with_max = 7
- Finding: There are 7 dates with the highest attendance.

Conclusion
- True: The highest attendance is 20066.
- False: It did not occur on 6 dates; it occurred on 7 dates, as listed above.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "occur on 6 date" to mean the count of dates on which the maximum attendance value appears in the table.
- Used the table public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season as the sole authoritative source; the date column is text and shown as stored.
