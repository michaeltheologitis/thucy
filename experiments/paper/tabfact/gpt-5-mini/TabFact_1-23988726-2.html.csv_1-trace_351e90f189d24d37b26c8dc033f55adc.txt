Claim interpreted: The North American (3000 m steeplechase) record was set on July 14, 2006.

What I checked:
- Queried the available TabFact database table that lists regional records for the 3000 m steeplechase, including the “north american record” entry with its date.

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table;

- Relevant returned row (from the tool’s result):
  "world record": north american record
  "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )": daniel lincoln ( usa )
  "7:53.63": 8:08.82
  "brussels , belgium": rome , italy
  "3 september 2004": 14 july 2006

Analysis:
- The table’s “north american record” entry shows the date as “14 july 2006.” This directly supports the claim that the North American record was set on July 14, 2006.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the North American record in the men’s 3000 m steeplechase (as presented in the available data table).
