Summary of approach:
- I first discovered the available data source and examined its structure to ground the verification in actual data.
- I then queried the episode with no in series = 57 to check its U.S. viewership.

Data source discovered:
- TabFact (PostgreSQL) → schema: public → table: list_of_white_collar_episodes (appears to list episodes of the TV series White Collar)

Relevant schema (from metadata):
- Columns include: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text).
- The column name "us viewers (million)" indicates viewership is stored in millions.

Evidence (executed SQL and result):
SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in series", "no in season", "original air date", "us viewers (million)"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE "no in series" = 57;

Result:
- title: family business
- no in series: 57
- no in season: 11
- original air date: january 22 , 2013
- us viewers (million): 2.77

Assessment of the claim:
- The claim: "episode number 57 in the series have 2.75 thousand us viewer".
- Data shows episode 57 has 2.77 million U.S. viewers. 2.77 million equals 2,770 thousand viewers, not 2.75 thousand. The claim’s unit (thousand) is off by three orders of magnitude relative to the data. Even if the intent was millions, 2.75 vs 2.77 differs from the recorded value.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "the series" refers to White Collar, since the only available dataset is list_of_white_collar_episodes for that series.
- "us viewers (million)" represents the number of U.S. viewers in millions as stored in the dataset.
