Summary of claim: “dan o 'sullivan go to kansas and play the center position.” I interpret this as stating that the player Dan O’Sullivan attended the University of Kansas and that he played the center position.

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact14 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster.
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Locate any player with the surname “Sullivan” and inspect school and position
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%sullivan%';
Result:
- player: dan o 'sullivan | position: center | school / club team: fordham

2) Confirm the full row for the matching player
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Sullivan%';
Result:
- player: dan o 'sullivan
- nationality: united states
- position: center
- years for jazz: 1990 - 91
- school / club team: fordham

3) Explicitly test whether his school/club team mentions “kansas”
SQL:
SELECT player, ("school / club team" ILIKE '%kansas%') AS has_kansas
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE regexp_replace(lower(player), '[^a-z0-9]+', '', 'g') = regexp_replace(lower('dan o ''sullivan'), '[^a-z0-9]+', '', 'g');
Result:
- player: dan o 'sullivan | has_kansas: false

Assessment
- Position: center — Supported by the data.
- School: Kansas — Not supported; the database lists “fordham” as his school/club team, and an explicit check for “kansas” returned false.

Conclusion
The claim is mixed: Dan O’Sullivan did play center, but the data shows he did not go to Kansas (listed school is Fordham). Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- “go to kansas” is interpreted as having attended the University of Kansas as indicated by the “school / club team” field in the roster table.
