Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources to identify relevant tables.
- Reviewed the schema for the 1946 VFL season table.
- Queried for the specific fixture where home team is St Kilda and away team is North Melbourne, and inspected the recorded scores.

Data source discovery
- Source: PostgreSQL instance via postgres_tabfact30
- Discovered table: public.t_1946_vfl_season

Schema details (public.t_1946_vfl_season)
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
- No primary or foreign keys defined.

Evidence query and result
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%St Kilda%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%North Melbourne%';

Query result (home team | away team | home team score | away team score | date | venue):
- st kilda | north melbourne | 10.14 (74) | 12.11 (83) | 13 july 1946 | junction oval

Assessment
- The data shows a match where the home team is St Kilda and the away team is North Melbourne. The away team score in that match is recorded as 12.11 (83).
- This directly supports the claim that St Kilda played North Melbourne and that North Melbourne had a score of 12.11 (83).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the 1946 VFL season table.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (1946 VFL season).
- Performed case-insensitive matching of team names due to lowercase storage in the table.
