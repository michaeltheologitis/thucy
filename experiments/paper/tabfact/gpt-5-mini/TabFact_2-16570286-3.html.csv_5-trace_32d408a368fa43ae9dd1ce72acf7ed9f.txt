Overview of data sources explored:
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact33 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant cricket/bowling table identified via schema inspection:
  • Table: public.t_1948_ashes_series
    - Columns: player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text)

Evidence queries and results:
1) Identify bowlers with exactly 13 or 11 wickets and their match counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, team, matches, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets IN (13, 11) ORDER BY wickets DESC, matches ASC;
Result:
- keith miller | australia | matches: 5 | wickets: 13
- ernie toshack | australia | matches: 4 | wickets: 11

Analysis:
- The bowler with 13 wickets (Keith Miller) played 5 matches.
- The bowler with 11 wickets (Ernie Toshack) played 4 matches.
- The claim states that the 13-wicket bowler appears in fewer matches than the 11-wicket bowler. The data shows the opposite: 5 > 4.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data from t_1948_ashes_series.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “appear in less match” as “played fewer matches,” using the ‘matches’ column as the measure of appearances.
- Interpreted “the bowler with 13 wicket” and “the bowler with 11 wicket” as the players with exactly those wicket totals in this dataset (there is exactly one for each).
