Claim: “fukusyū no puropōzu have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.”

Summary conclusion based on the data: The episode “fukusyū no puropōzu” has the 4th most recent broadcast date (2010-05-24) in the dataset, not the 2nd. The 2nd most recent broadcast date belongs to “suki to ietara iinoni” (2010-06-07).

Data source
- PostgreSQL instance postgres_tabfact12, schema public, table: public.tsuki_no_koibito
  Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (text), "episode title" (text), "romanized title" (text), "translation of title" (text), "broadcast date" (text), "ratings" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Order all episodes by broadcast date (most recent first) and show ranks
- SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date",
       to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s+,', ',' , 'g')), 'Month DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date,
       row_number() OVER (ORDER BY to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s+,', ',' , 'g')), 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC) AS rank
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY rank;
- Result (romanized title | broadcast date | parsed_date | rank):
  1) saishūshōjomakuwakare | june 14 , 2010 | 2010-06-14 | 1
  2) suki to ietara iinoni | june 7 , 2010 | 2010-06-07 | 2
  3) konna ni suki dattanda… | may 31 , 2010 | 2010-05-31 | 3
  4) fukusyū no puropōzu | may 24 , 2010 | 2010-05-24 | 4
  5) arienai kisu | may 17 , 2010 | 2010-05-17 | 5
  6) omae ga hosii | may 10 , 2010 | 2010-05-10 | 6

2) Directly identify the 2nd most recent broadcast
- SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", to_date("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY parsed_date DESC NULLS LAST
LIMIT 5;
- Observation from the top rows returned:
  - 1st most recent: saishūshōjomakuwakare — june 14 , 2010 (2010-06-14)
  - 2nd most recent: suki to ietara iinoni — june 7 , 2010 (2010-06-07)

3) Compute the correct rank for the specific episode “fukusyū no puropōzu” (ranking done over all rows before filtering)
- SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT "Unnamed: 0","episode title","romanized title","broadcast date",
    to_date(regexp_replace(initcap("broadcast date"),'\\s*,\\s*',', '),'Month DD, YYYY') AS bcast_parsed,
    rank() OVER (ORDER BY to_date(regexp_replace(initcap("broadcast date"),'\\s*,\\s*',', '),'Month DD, YYYY') DESC) AS rank_all
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE "romanized title" = 'fukusyū no puropōzu';
- Result:
  - romanized title: fukusyū no puropōzu
  - broadcast date: may 24 , 2010
  - bcast_parsed: 2010-05-24
  - rank_all: 4

Conclusion
- The data shows “fukusyū no puropōzu” ranks 4th by broadcast date (most recent first). Therefore, it does not have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.

Assumptions
- “2nd most recent” is interpreted as the second latest calendar date when ordering all rows by their broadcast dates descending.
- The broadcast date text format is consistently like “monthname day , year” (e.g., “may 24 , 2010”); normalization (initcap and removing extra spaces around commas) was applied before parsing with to_date.
- All evidence was drawn exclusively from public.tsuki_no_koibito in the postgres_tabfact12 data source.
