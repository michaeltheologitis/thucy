Claim to verify: “the match on march 7 , 2001 february 21 , 2001 both have attendance over 25000.” Interpreted as: Both the March 7, 2001 and February 21, 2001 matches in the available season table have attendance greater than 25,000.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: TabFact PostgreSQL, public schema. A relevant table exists: t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (date, opponent, venue, result, attendance).

Schema confirmation (executed SQL and evidence)
- SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  Result: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Date format inspection (executed SQL and sample evidence)
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season LIMIT 10;
  Sample rows include dates like “13 august 2000”, confirming format is day month year in lowercase text.

Targeted verification of the two dates (executed SQL and results)
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE date IN ('21 february 2001', '7 march 2001');
  Results:
  - 21 february 2001 | opponent: nottingham forest | venue: a | result: 1 - 0 | attendance: 23266
  - 7 march 2001     | opponent: portsmouth         | venue: h | result: 0 - 0 | attendance: 20503

Assessment
- Both attendances (23,266 and 20,503) are below 25,000. Therefore, the claim that both matches had attendance over 25,000 is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate based on the authoritative table data shown above.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim to refer to the matches recorded in the table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (the only available dataset with date and attendance). The date strings were matched exactly as stored in the table: '21 february 2001' and '7 march 2001'.
