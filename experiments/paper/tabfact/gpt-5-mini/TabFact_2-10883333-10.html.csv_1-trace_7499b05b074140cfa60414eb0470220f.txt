Claim interpreted: “North Melbourne have the highest score out of all the away teams.” I verify this against the available match-results data.

Data source examined
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact7 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL season results). Columns include home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.
- Note: The table contains 6 rows (a subset of the season). Scores are stored as strings like “17.19 (121)”, where the number in parentheses is total points.

Evidence
1) Sample of the dataset (shows the presence of North Melbourne and away scores):
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Result rows (6 returned):
- home team: geelong | home team score: 14.20 (104) | away team: melbourne         | away team score: 14.14 (98)
- home team: st kilda| home team score: 15.9 (99)    | away team: north melbourne  | away team score: 17.19 (121)
- home team: richmond| home team score: 19.14 (128)  | away team: essendon         | away team score: 12.9 (81)
- home team: hawthorn| home team score: 19.24 (138)  | away team: collingwood      | away team score: 13.11 (89)
- home team: fitzroy | home team score: 15.7 (97)    | away team: carlton          | away team score: 16.10 (106)
- home team: footscray| home team score: 13.11 (89)  | away team: south melbourne  | away team score: 12.15 (87)

2) Compute and rank away-team total points (extract integer in parentheses from "away team score"):
SQL:
SELECT "away team" AS away_team, "away team score" AS away_team_score,
CAST(substring("away team score" from (strpos("away team score",'(')+1) for (strpos("away team score",')') - strpos("away team score",'(') - 1)) AS INTEGER) AS total_points
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
ORDER BY total_points DESC, away_team;
Results (team — away team score — total points):
1) north melbourne — 17.19 (121) — 121
2) carlton — 16.10 (106) — 106
3) melbourne — 14.14 (98) — 98
4) collingwood — 13.11 (89) — 89
5) south melbourne — 12.15 (87) — 87
6) essendon — 12.9 (81) — 81

3) Maximum away-team total points:
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(substring("away team score" from (strpos("away team score",'(')+1) for (strpos("away team score",')') - strpos("away team score",'(') - 1)) AS INTEGER)) AS max_away_points
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
- max_away_points: 121

4) Verify whether North Melbourne holds that maximum (case-insensitive team match):
SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  WHERE lower("away team") = lower('North Melbourne')
    AND CAST(substring("away team score" from (strpos("away team score",'(')+1) for (strpos("away team score",')') - strpos("away team score",'(') - 1)) AS INTEGER) = (
      SELECT MAX(CAST(substring("away team score" from (strpos("away team score",'(')+1) for (strpos("away team score",')') - strpos("away team score",'(') - 1)) AS INTEGER)) FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
    )
) THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS north_melbourne_holds_max;
Result:
- north_melbourne_holds_max: true

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (6 matches from the 1975 VFL season table), North Melbourne recorded the highest away-team total points (121). The claim is supported by the data we have.

Assumptions
- I interpret “highest score out of all the away teams” to mean the highest away-team total points in the dataset at hand.
- Scores were parsed as the integer inside parentheses of the score string.
- The finding is limited to the available rows in public.t_1975_vfl_season (6 games); no broader seasons or leagues were accessible via the tools for this verification.
