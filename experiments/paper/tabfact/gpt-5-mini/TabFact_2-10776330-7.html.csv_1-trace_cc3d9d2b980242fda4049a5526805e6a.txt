Claim: “Kardinia Park [was] one of the six venues that were used on 3 June 1961.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact4 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_1961_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", crowd, date.

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Identify how the date is stored to target the correct rows
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season WHERE date ILIKE '%June 1961%';
Result: returned the distinct date value "3 june 1961", indicating lowercase storage.

2) List all matches played on that date (to see venues explicitly)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "venue", date
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE date = '3 june 1961';
Returned rows:
- home team: north melbourne | away team: st kilda     | venue: arden street oval | date: 3 june 1961
- home team: hawthorn        | away team: richmond     | venue: glenferrie oval   | date: 3 june 1961
- home team: collingwood     | away team: essendon     | venue: victoria park     | date: 3 june 1961
- home team: geelong         | away team: footscray    | venue: kardinia park     | date: 3 june 1961
- home team: south melbourne | away team: fitzroy      | venue: lake oval         | date: 3 june 1961
- home team: melbourne       | away team: carlton      | venue: mcg               | date: 3 june 1961

3) Count and list distinct venues used on that date
3a) Confirm the exact stored date (robust check)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_1961_vfl_season WHERE date ILIKE '%3 June 1961%' OR date ILIKE '%03 June 1961%' OR date ILIKE '%3 Jun 1961%' OR date ILIKE '%03 Jun 1961%';
Result: [{"date":"3 june 1961"}]

3b) Retrieve distinct venues for the date
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM t_1961_vfl_season WHERE date = '3 june 1961' ORDER BY venue;
Result: [{"venue":"arden street oval"}, {"venue":"glenferrie oval"}, {"venue":"kardinia park"}, {"venue":"lake oval"}, {"venue":"mcg"}, {"venue":"victoria park"}]

3c) Count distinct venues for the date
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT venue) AS distinct_venues FROM t_1961_vfl_season WHERE date = '3 june 1961';
Result: [{"distinct_venues":6}]

Assessment
