Claim to verify: "in 1996 , the southeast region have a record of 24 - 9"

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified: public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (columns: year, record, seed, region, results).

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, region, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1996;
- Result:
  - year: 1996
  - region: southeast
  - record: 24 - 9

Assessment:
- The row for year 1996 in the dataset has region = "southeast" and record = "24 - 9". This directly supports the claim as stated (interpreted as referencing the 1996 entry where the region is southeast and the team’s record is 24-9).

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the VCU Rams men’s basketball dataset in the available database, and “the southeast region have a record of 24 - 9” is intended to mean that in 1996, the entry associated with the Southeast region lists a 24-9 record for the team.
