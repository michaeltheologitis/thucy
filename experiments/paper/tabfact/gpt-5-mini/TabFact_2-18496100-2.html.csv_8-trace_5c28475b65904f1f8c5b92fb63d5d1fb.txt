Claim to verify: "sewda have the second lowest number of electorate in 2009"

Summary finding: The data shows Sewda has the lowest (not second lowest) number of electorates in 2009 among the entries for Bhind Lok Sabha constituency. The second lowest is Bhander.

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
1) Full ascending ranking of 2009 electorates by name
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "number of electorates (2009)" AS electorate_2009,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC) AS rank_by_2009
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC NULLS LAST, "name";

Result (name — electorate_2009 — rank):
1) sewda — 130161 — rank 1
2) bhander — 139600 — rank 2
3) datia — 143593 — rank 3
4) gohad — 166893 — rank 4
5) ater — 177334 — rank 5
6) bhind — 197183 — rank 6
7) lahar — 205839 — rank 7
8) mehgaon — 210649 — rank 8
9) total : — 1371252 — rank 9

2) Specific check for Sewda’s rank
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "number of electorates (2009)" AS electorate_2009,
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC) AS rank_by_2009,
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC) AS dense_rank_2009,
ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC) AS rownum_2009
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE lower("name")='sewda';

Result for Sewda: sewda — 130161 — rank_by_2009 = 1, dense_rank_2009 = 1, rownum_2009 = 1.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. Sewda has the lowest electorate count in 2009, not the second lowest. The second lowest is Bhander with 139,600.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the table public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency and the column "number of electorates (2009)".
- Name matching for "sewda" is case-insensitive.
- All rows were included in ranking; the row labeled "total :" does not affect the conclusion since it is the largest value, not among the lowest.
