Claim: “Kardinia Park was one of the four venues used on 3 June 1961.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1961_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date".

Evidence
1) Matches played on 3 June 1961, including venues
- Result (from the database):
  • North Melbourne 9.14 (68) vs St Kilda 11.16 (82) — Arden Street Oval
  • Hawthorn 10.13 (73) vs Richmond 8.12 (60) — Glenferrie Oval
  • Collingwood 18.11 (119) vs Essendon 8.10 (58) — Victoria Park
  • Geelong 13.13 (91) vs Footscray 4.14 (38) — Kardinia Park
  • South Melbourne 7.8 (50) vs Fitzroy 17.15 (117) — Lake Oval
  • Melbourne 15.14 (104) vs Carlton 11.13 (79) — MCG
- Number of distinct venues used that day: 6
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","crowd","date"
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%3 June 1961%';

  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT venue) AS distinct_venues
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%3 june 1961%';

2) Distinct venues and match counts on 3 June 1961 (date format check + exact list)
- Date format verification (executed SQL):
  SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season WHERE "date" ILIKE '%June%1961%' ORDER BY "date";
  Result: [ {"date": "3 june 1961"} ]

- Distinct venues with counts (executed SQL):
  SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  WHERE "date" = '3 june 1961'
  GROUP BY venue
  ORDER BY matches DESC, venue;

- Result:
  • arden street oval — 1 match
  • glenferrie oval — 1 match
  • kardinia park — 1 match
  • lake oval — 1 match
  • mcg — 1 match
  • victoria park — 1 match

Assessment
- True: Kardinia Park was used on 3 June 1961 (Geelong vs Footscray).
- False: Only four venues were used. The data shows six distinct venues hosted matches that day.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct element (Kardinia Park was used that day) with an incorrect one (there were not four but six venues). Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Victorian Football League (VFL) matches scheduled on 3 June 1961, as represented in the t_1961_vfl_season table. Dates are stored as text (e.g., '3 june 1961'), and the TabFact dataset is treated as authoritative within scope.
