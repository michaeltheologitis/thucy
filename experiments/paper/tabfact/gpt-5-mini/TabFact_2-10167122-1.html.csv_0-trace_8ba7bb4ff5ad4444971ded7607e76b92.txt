Objective
Verify the claim: “the open championship [is] the tournament with the highest number of event” using the available data.

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database context: TabFact (public schema)
- Available table: public.brian_watts
  - Columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), "top - 5" (bigint), "top - 25" (bigint), events (bigint), "cuts made" (bigint)
  - No other related tables or views

Evidence from executed SQL
1) List all tournaments and their events to understand the distribution
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY events DESC, tournament ASC;
Results:
- tournament: totals, events: 17
- tournament: the open championship, events: 7
- tournament: pga championship, events: 6
- tournament: masters tournament, events: 2
- tournament: us open, events: 2

2) Compute the overall maximum events value (unfiltered)
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(events) AS max_events FROM public.brian_watts;
Result:
- max_events: 17
Note: This corresponds to the row labeled "totals", which is not a tournament.

3) Find the maximum events among actual tournaments (exclude aggregate row ‘totals’)
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(events) AS max_events FROM public.brian_watts WHERE tournament IS NOT NULL AND lower(tournament) NOT IN ('totals','total') AND events IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- max_events: 7

4) Identify which tournament(s) have that maximum events value
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts WHERE tournament IS NOT NULL AND lower(tournament) NOT IN ('totals','total') AND events = 7 ORDER BY tournament;
Result:
- tournament: the open championship, events: 7

Conclusion
- Excluding the non-tournament aggregate row “totals,” the Open Championship has the highest number of events (7) among the listed tournaments in the dataset. No other tournament matches this count (next highest is the PGA Championship with 6).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “event” as the numeric value in the column events.
- Treated the row labeled “totals” as an aggregate summary, not a tournament; thus excluded from “tournament” comparisons.
- Tournament name matching is case-insensitive (the table stores it as "the open championship").
