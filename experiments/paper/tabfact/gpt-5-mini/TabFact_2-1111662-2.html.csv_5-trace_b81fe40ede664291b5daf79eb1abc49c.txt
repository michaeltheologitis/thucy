Claim to verify: “the record for the discus throw be set in the 5th of sep 1986 by bulgaria.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered 1 accessible database: postgres_tabfact1 (TabFact), schema public, table memorial_van_damme with columns (event, record, athlete, nationality, date).

Evidence from data
- Query executed to find the discus throw record:

  SQL:
  SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE lower(event) LIKE '%discus%';

- Result returned by the database:
  - Event: discus throw
  - Record: 69.84 m
  - Athlete: tsvetanka christova
  - Nationality: bulgaria
  - Date: 5 september 1986

Assessment
- The dataset shows the discus throw record (for the Memorial Van Damme meet) was set on 5 September 1986 by a Bulgarian athlete, Tsvetanka Christova. This directly matches the claim’s key elements: event (discus throw), date (5 Sep 1986), and nationality (Bulgaria).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the record” as the Memorial Van Damme meeting record (the context of the available memorial_van_damme dataset), not the overall world record.
