Claim interpreted: For teams with position > 10, the total “score” is zero. Because “score” could mean league points or goals scored, I verified both, and also checked whether any teams have position > 10 at all.

Finding: There are no teams with position > 10 in the dataset. Consequently, the total points and total goals scored for that group are 0 (treating empty-set sums as 0).

Evidence (exact SQL and results):
1) Are there any teams with position > 10?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_teams FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result:
[{"count_teams": 0}]

2) Total points for teams with position > 10
SQL (numeric total with empty set treated as 0):
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(points), 0) AS total_points FROM t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result:
[{"total_points": 0}]

(SQL behavior note):
SQL:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points FROM t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result:
[{"total_points": null}]

3) Total goals scored for teams with position > 10
SQL (plain SUM over empty set returns NULL):
SELECT SUM(scored) AS total_scored FROM t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result:
[{"total_scored": null}]

SQL (empty set treated as 0):
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(scored), 0) AS total_scored_zero FROM t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result:
[{"total_scored_zero": 0}]

Conclusion: Because there are zero teams with position > 10, any reasonable interpretation of “total score” (points or goals scored) sums to 0 when treating the empty set as zero. Thus the claim holds.

Assumptions made:
- “Score” refers to either league points (points) or goals scored (scored). I reported both.
- “Position higher than 10” means strictly greater than 10.
- The verification uses the table public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football in the available data source (postgres_tabfact9).
