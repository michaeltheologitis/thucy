Scope and data source explored
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (public schema). Identified one table relevant to the claim: public.zakspeed with columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint).

What I checked
- Whether the only chassis recorded for the year 1985 in public.zakspeed is “zakspeed 841”.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Distinct chassis for 1985
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT chassis FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1985 ORDER BY chassis;
Result:
[{"chassis":"zakspeed 841"}]

2) Count of distinct chassis for 1985
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT chassis) AS distinct_chassis_count FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1985;
Result:
[{"distinct_chassis_count":1}]

3) All rows for 1985 (to confirm no other chassis appear)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1985;
Result:
- year: 1985; chassis: zakspeed 841; engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c; tyres: g; points: 0

4) Row count for 1985
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1985;
Result:
- row_count: 1

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one chassis recorded for the year 1985 in the zakspeed table, and it is “zakspeed 841”. The claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the Zakspeed entries represented in the TabFact.public.zakspeed table, not to all Formula One teams globally in 1985.
