Claim to verify:
“At the National Stadium Tokyo venue, during season 1995-6 detail, the title is 32nd and the runner-up is Waseda.”

What the data shows (from the all_japan_university_rugby_championship table):
- title: 32nd
- season: 1995 - 6 details
- winner: meiji
- score: 43 - 9
- runner - up: waseda
- venue: national stadium , tokyo , tokyo
- attendance: n / a

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- Venue: “National Stadium Tokyo” aligns with the stored value “national stadium , tokyo , tokyo.” Supported.
- Season: The claim says “1995 - 6 detail”; the database stores “1995 - 6 details.” This is a trivial wording difference. Supported.
- Title: “32nd.” Matches exactly. Supported.
- Runner-up: “Waseda.” Matches exactly. Supported.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) Identify the exact season string used in the database
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship ORDER BY season;

2) Retrieve the full record for that season
SELECT title, season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue, attendance
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season = '1995 - 6 details';

Conclusion: All specified elements of the claim are consistent with the database record for the 1995–96 season of the All-Japan University Rugby Championship.

Assumptions and interpretation notes:
- Treated “1995 - 6 detail” as equivalent to the stored “1995 - 6 details.”
- Treated “National Stadium Tokyo” as equivalent to “national stadium , tokyo , tokyo” (case and punctuation normalized).
