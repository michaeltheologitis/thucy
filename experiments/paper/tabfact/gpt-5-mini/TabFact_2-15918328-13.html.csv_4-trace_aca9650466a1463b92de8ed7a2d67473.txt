Findings
- Katee Shean and Joshua Allen did perform to “All by Myself – Celine Dion,” but it was a Contemporary routine (choreographer: Tyce Diorio), not a Paso Doble.
- They also performed a Paso Doble, but it used the music “Filet from Le Rêve” (choreographer: Jason Gilkison), not “All by Myself.”

Conclusion
- The claim conflates two separate performances. The song and style pairings are mismatched according to the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the user’s input as the declarative claim that the duo danced a Paso Doble to Celine Dion’s “All by Myself.”
- Matching was done case-insensitively on text fields to ensure comprehensive retrieval.
