Claim to verify: “The [entity] incorporated in Netherlands has a group’s equity shareholding of 99% and principal activities of flight academy.”

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Tool used: Data source discovery
- Result: One accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)

Step 2 — Understand the relevant schema
- Tool used: Schema inspection
- Finding: Table public.klm with relevant columns (all text):
  - company
  - type
  - principal activities
  - incorporated in
  - group 's equity shareholding
- No primary keys or relationships defined.

Step 3 — Query the data for evidence
A) Identify entities incorporated in Netherlands with principal activities mentioning “flight academy”
Executed SQL:
SELECT company, "incorporated in", "principal activities", "group \'s equity shareholding" 
FROM public.klm
WHERE lower("incorporated in") = 'netherlands'
  AND lower("principal activities") LIKE '%flight academy%';

Result:
- company: klm flight academy
- incorporated in: netherlands
- principal activities: flight academy
- group 's equity shareholding: 100%

B) Check specifically for a 99% group’s equity shareholding under the same conditions
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.klm
WHERE "incorporated in" = 'Netherlands'
  AND "principal activities" ILIKE '%flight academy%'
  AND "group \'s equity shareholding" = '99%';

Result:
- match_count = 0 (no such records)

Conclusion based on data
- True: There exists an entity incorporated in the Netherlands with principal activities of “flight academy” (klm flight academy).
- False: The group’s equity shareholding is not 99%; the database shows 100%.

Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data: the incorporation country and activity match, but the stated shareholding percentage does not.

Assumptions made
- “the incorporate in netherlands” was interpreted as records where the column “incorporated in” equals “Netherlands” (case-insensitive).
- “principal activities of flight academy” was interpreted as records where “principal activities” contains the phrase “flight academy” (case-insensitive).
- “group’s equity shareholding of 99%” was matched to the literal text value '99%' in the column “group 's equity shareholding.”
