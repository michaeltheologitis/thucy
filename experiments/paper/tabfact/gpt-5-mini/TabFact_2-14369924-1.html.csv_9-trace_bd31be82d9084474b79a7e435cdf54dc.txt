Claim to verify:
- “The ERP W and class for W290AG and W230AV be 55 and D for both, but one has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama and the other has a city of license of Macon, Georgia.”

Data source discovery and structure:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public containing table `wyfk`.
- Table wyfk columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (text), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text).

Evidence
1) Retrieve records for W290AG and W230AV
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "fcc info" 
FROM public.wyfk
WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w290ag','w230av');

Result:
- call sign: w230av; frequency mhz: 93.9 fm; city of license: gadsden , alabama; erp w: 10; class: d; fcc info: fcc
- call sign: w290ag; frequency mhz: 105.9 fm; city of license: griffin , georgia; erp w: 27; class: d; fcc info: fcc

2) Check whether either has ERP W = 55 or the claimed cities of license
Executed SQL (step A):
SELECT "call sign", "erp w", "city of license" 
FROM public.wyfk
WHERE lower(trim("call sign")) IN ('w290ag','w230av');

Result:
- w230av — erp w: 10 — city of license: gadsden , alabama
- w290ag — erp w: 27 — city of license: griffin , georgia

Executed SQL (step B):
SELECT "call sign", "erp w", "city of license" 
FROM public.wyfk
WHERE lower(trim("call sign")) IN ('w290ag','w230av')
  AND ("erp w" = 55 OR lower(trim("city of license")) IN ('anniston , alabama','macon , georgia')) ;

Result: No rows returned (no match with ERP 55 W or the specified cities for these call signs).

Findings:
- ERP: W290AG has 27 W; W230AV has 10 W. Neither has 55 W.
- Class: Both W290AG and W230AV are class D. This matches the claim.
- City of license: W290AG is listed as Griffin, Georgia (not Macon, Georgia). W230AV is listed as Gadsden, Alabama (not Anniston, Alabama).

Conclusion:
- The statement that both have class D is supported.
- The statements about ERP = 55 W for both and the cities of license (Anniston, AL and Macon, GA) are contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Treated the `wyfk` table in the TabFact database as authoritative for these attributes.
- Matching of call signs and city names was done case-insensitively and with trimming to avoid whitespace mismatches.
