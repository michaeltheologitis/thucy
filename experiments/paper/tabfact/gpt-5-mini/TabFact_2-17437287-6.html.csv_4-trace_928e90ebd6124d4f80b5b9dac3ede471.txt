- tie no: 4, home team: birmingham city, score: 1 - 3, away team: watford, date: 10 march 1984

Broader variant:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE "date" LIKE '10 March 1984%' AND "away team" ILIKE '%Birmingham%';

Result: 0 rows

Conclusion
- The data shows no match on 10 March 1984 with Birmingham City as the away team. Instead, Birmingham City played at home on that date and lost 1 - 3 to Watford in the FA Cup. Therefore, the statement that Birmingham City were the away team is incorrect, although the 1 - 3 scoreline for a Birmingham City match on that date is correct.

Assumptions and scope
- The verification is based solely on the available TabFact public.t_1983_84_fa_cup table (1983–84 FA Cup). If the claim pertained to a different competition (e.g., league), that is outside the scope of the accessible data. Dates are stored as text; case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) and exact string LIKE patterns for '10 March 1984' were used. 'Birmingham' matching was done case-insensitively and includes 'Birmingham City'.
