Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. In the available dataset, the maximum 2006 subscribers for Mobilis is 7476 (thousands), but this is in Algeria—not Egypt. There is no record of Mobilis in Egypt in 2006. For Egypt in 2006, the providers listed are Mobinil (9267) and Vodafone (8704), both in thousands.

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
- Columns: provider (text), country (text), subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint), subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint), growth % (double precision)

Key evidence with executed SQL and results
1) Distinct providers (to confirm presence of 'mobilis' and 'mobinil')
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT provider FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa ORDER BY provider;
Results:
- airtel
- djezzy
- glo mobile
- maroc
- mobilis
- mobinil
- mtn
- vodacom
- vodafone

2) Egypt rows in 2006 (to see which providers operate in Egypt and their 2006 subscriber counts)
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE country ILIKE '%egypt%';
Results:
- provider: mobinil, country: egypt, subscribers (2006) (thousands): 9267
- provider: vodafone, country: egypt, subscribers (2006) (thousands): 8704

3) Mobilis rows and their 2006 subscriber counts (to verify Mobilis and identify its country)
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'mobilis';
Results:
- provider: mobilis, country: algeria, subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476

4) Maximum 2006 subscribers for Mobilis and where it occurs
SQL (max value):
SELECT MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)") AS max_subscribers FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'mobilis';
Result:
- max_subscribers: 7476
SQL (country at max):
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'mobilis' AND "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" = (SELECT MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)") FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'mobilis');
Result:
- provider: mobilis, country: algeria, subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476

5) Check for any Mobilis entry in Egypt (to directly test the claim’s location)
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'mobilis' AND country ILIKE '%egypt%';
Result:
- 0 rows (no Mobilis entries in Egypt)

Overall assessment
- The numeric value 7476 (thousands) matches Mobilis, but the associated country is Algeria, not Egypt. In Egypt, the relevant 2006 providers are Mobinil (9267) and Vodafone (8704), and there is no Mobilis record.

Assumptions
- “subscriber” refers to the column "subscribers (2006) (thousands)".
- “Mobilis” refers to the provider value exactly as stored in the provider column.
- Country matching is case-insensitive (e.g., 'egypt' equals 'Egypt').
