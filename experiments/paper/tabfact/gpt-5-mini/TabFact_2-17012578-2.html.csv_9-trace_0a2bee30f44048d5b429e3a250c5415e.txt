Data sources discovered: one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a single table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials (columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city).

Claim interpreted: The statement suggests that, for the entry associated with the city “Beausejour,” the lead is “Aaron Watson.” I verify this against the available table.

Step 1: Retrieve the record(s) for city = 'beausejour'.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead" FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city = 'beausejour';
Result:
- skip: jason gunnlaugson
- third / vice skip: justin richter
- second: braden zawada
- lead: tyler forrest

Step 2: Check whether any row has lead = 'Aaron Watson' and, if so, which city it’s associated with.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead", city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE lower(lead) = lower('Aaron Watson');
Result:
- city: richmond
- skip: greg mcaulay
- third / vice skip: ken maskiewich
- second: deane horning
- lead: aaron watson

Findings:
- For Beausejour, the lead is “tyler forrest,” not “Aaron Watson.”
- “Aaron Watson” appears as a lead in the table, but for the city “richmond,” not “beausejour.”

Conclusion: The claim that “beausejour have a lead of aaron watson” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Have a lead of” is interpreted as the team’s lead position in the 2009 Canadian Olympic curling trials dataset.
- Matching for names was case-insensitive to account for capitalization in the claim vs. data.
