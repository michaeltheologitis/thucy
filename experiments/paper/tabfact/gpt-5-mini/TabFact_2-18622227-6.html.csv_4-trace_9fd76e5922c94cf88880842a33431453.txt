Summary
- Interpretation: I interpret the claim as referring to the number of entries marked with the letter "a" (commonly used to denote absence/did not participate) in the Katrina Adams Grand Slam results table for the Australian Open and Wimbledon across the listed years. 
- Finding: The Australian Open row contains 3 occurrences of "a"; the Wimbledon row contains 1 occurrence of "a".

Data source discovery
- Available data sources: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table public.katrina_adams containing tournament results by year for Katrina Adams.

Relevant data inspection (evidence)
1) Inspect raw data
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams;
Observation (relevant rows):
- australian open: a in 1986, 1991, 1996; other cells include 3r, qf, etc.
- wimbledon: a in 1986; other cells include sf, qf, 3r, etc.

2) Identify year columns
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='katrina_adams' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Resulting columns used for counting: 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999.

3) Count occurrences of 'a' for the two tournaments (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament,
 ((CASE WHEN lower("1986")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1988")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1989")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1990")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1991")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1992")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1993")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1994")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1995")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1996")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1997")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1998")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 + (CASE WHEN lower("1999")='a' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
 ) AS a_count
FROM public.katrina_adams
WHERE lower(tournament) IN ('australian open','wimbledon');
Results:
- australian open: a_count = 3
- wimbledon: a_count = 1

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: Australian Open has 3 'a' results and Wimbledon has 1 'a' result in this dataset.

Assumptions
- "a result" means cells equal to the letter "a" in the results table for Katrina Adams.
- Tournament name and the value 'a' were matched case-insensitively.
- The verification is limited to the years present in the table (1986, 1988–1999).
