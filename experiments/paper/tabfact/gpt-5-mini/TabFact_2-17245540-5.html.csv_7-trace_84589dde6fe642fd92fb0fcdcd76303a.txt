Claim interpreted: “the player from new zealand be in last place.” I verified this against the available TabFact public table t_1973_u_s_open_golf.

Step 1 — Confirm countries present
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY country ASC;
- Result:
  - new zealand
  - south africa
  - united states

Step 2 — Identify the player(s) from New Zealand and their place
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", NULLIF(translate(place, 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ', ''), '')::int AS numeric_place
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE lower(country) = 'new zealand'
  ORDER BY numeric_place ASC;
- Result:
  - place: t3; player: bob charles; country: new zealand; score: 71 + 69 = 140; to par: - 2; numeric_place: 3

Step 3 — Determine last place in the table and who occupies it
- SQL executed (compute max place):
  SELECT MAX((regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g'))::int) AS max_place
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g') <> '';
- Result:
  - max_place = 6

- SQL executed (list rows at last place):
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par"
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g') <> ''
    AND (regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g'))::int = (
      SELECT MAX((regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g'))::int)
      FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
      WHERE regexp_replace(place, '\D', '', 'g') <> ''
    );
- Result (all tied for 6th):
  - t6; gene borek; united states; 77 + 65 = 142; e
  - t6; julius boros; united states; 73 + 69 = 142; e
  - t6; tom weiskopf; united states; 73 + 69 = 142; e
  - t6; arnold palmer; united states; 71 + 71 = 142; e
  - t6; lee trevino; united states; 70 + 72 = 142; e

Conclusion
- The player from New Zealand (Bob Charles) is tied for 3rd (t3), not in last place (which is t6, all United States players). The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the TabFact table t_1973_u_s_open_golf (1973 U.S. Open golf standings).
- “Last place” is interpreted as the highest numeric rank in the place column after stripping tie indicators (e.g., ‘t’), with ties allowed at that rank.
- Country matching is case-insensitive (table stores ‘new zealand’ in lowercase).
