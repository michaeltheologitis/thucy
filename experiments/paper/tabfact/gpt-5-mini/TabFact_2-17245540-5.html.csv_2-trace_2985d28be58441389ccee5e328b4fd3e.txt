Summary
- Interpreted claim: The user asserts that, in the relevant dataset, Johnny Miller’s recorded place is “t3”.
- Data source discovery: Located a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a golf-related table: public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par).

Evidence
1) Targeted lookup for Johnny Miller’s place
Executed SQL:
SELECT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(player) = lower('Johnny Miller');
Result:
[{"place":"t3"}]

2) Contextual listing of all rows (to see placement values and tied positions)
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
ORDER BY
  CASE WHEN regexp_replace(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') ~ '^[0-9]+'
       THEN (regexp_replace(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int
       ELSE NULL
  END ASC,
  place ASC;
Result excerpt (as returned):
1 | gary player | south africa | 67 + 70 = 137 | - 5
2 | jim colbert | united states | 70 + 68 = 138 | - 4
t3 | jack nicklaus | united states | 71 + 69 = 140 | - 2
t3 | johnny miller | united states | 71 + 69 = 140 | - 2
t3 | bob charles | new zealand | 71 + 69 = 140 | - 2
...

Conclusion
- The database table explicitly records Johnny Miller’s place as t3. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim lacked context; I verified it against the available golf table public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf in the TabFact database and interpreted “place t3” as the placement value recorded in that table (likely a specific leaderboard snapshot).
