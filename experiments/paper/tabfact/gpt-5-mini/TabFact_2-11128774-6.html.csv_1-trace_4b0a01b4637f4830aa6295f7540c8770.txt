Claim: The visitor in Vancouver on February 24 was Winnipeg.

Data source explored: TabFact (public schema) — table t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence 1 — Direct lookup for February 24:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season WHERE (date ILIKE '%Feb%' OR date ILIKE '%February%') AND date ILIKE '%24%';
- Result:
  date: february 24, visitor: ny rangers, home: vancouver, score: 4 - 5

Evidence 2 — Nearby date showing Winnipeg as visitor (for potential confusion):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season WHERE date ILIKE '%February 20%';
- Result:
  date: february 20, visitor: winnipeg, home: vancouver, score: 2 - 4

Conclusion: On February 24, the visitor in Vancouver was "ny rangers," not Winnipeg. Winnipeg visited on February 20, not February 24.

Assumptions:
- "In Vancouver" refers to games where the home team is listed as "vancouver" in this table.
- The relevant context is the 1992–93 Vancouver Canucks season data contained in t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season, where dates are stored as lowercase month/day text without a year.
