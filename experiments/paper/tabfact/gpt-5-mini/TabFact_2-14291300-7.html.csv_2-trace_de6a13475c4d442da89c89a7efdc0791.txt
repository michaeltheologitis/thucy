Scope and data sources
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18).
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.my_info_table with columns (game bigint, march bigint, opponent text, score text, record text, points bigint).

Goal interpretation
- Verify whether “toronto maple leafs” is the opponent associated with the points 63, 66, and 69.

Evidence
1) List all rows where points ∈ {63, 66, 69}
SQL executed:
SELECT march, opponent, score, record, points
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE points IN (63, 66, 69)
ORDER BY points ASC, march;
Results:
- points 63: march 13, opponent: toronto maple leafs, score: 3 - 2, record: 25 - 30 - 13
- points 66: march 21, opponent: toronto maple leafs, score: 1 - 1, record: 26 - 31 - 14
- points 66: march 24, opponent: montreal canadiens, score: 3 - 5, record: 26 - 32 - 14
- points 69: march 28, opponent: pittsburgh penguins, score: 3 - 1, record: 27 - 33 - 15

2) Aggregate distinct opponents by each of the target points
SQL executed:
SELECT points, string_agg(DISTINCT opponent, ', ' ORDER BY opponent) AS opponents
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE points IN (63, 66, 69)
GROUP BY points
ORDER BY points;
Results:
- points = 63 -> opponents: toronto maple leafs
- points = 66 -> opponents: montreal canadiens, toronto maple leafs
- points = 69 -> opponents: pittsburgh penguins

3) Count how many games are recorded at each of the target points
SQL executed:
SELECT points, COUNT(*) AS games_at_points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE points IN (63,66,69) GROUP BY points ORDER BY points;
Results:
- points = 63: 1 game
- points = 66: 2 games
- points = 69: 1 game

Assessment of the claim
- At 63 points: Opponent is toronto maple leafs (supported).
- At 66 points: There are two entries; one opponent is toronto maple leafs and another is montreal canadiens (partly supports, not exclusively toronto maple leafs).
- At 69 points: Opponent is pittsburgh penguins (contradicts toronto maple leafs).

Conclusion
- The statement that the opponent list at 63, 66, and 69 points is (or is exclusively) the Toronto Maple Leafs is not fully supported. It is true for 63, partly true at 66 (since another opponent also appears), and false for 69.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “Is ‘toronto maple leafs’ the opponent for the rows at 63, 66, and 69 points in the available dataset?” If a different interpretation was intended (e.g., listing opponents at those points regardless of whether they are Toronto), the evidence above already provides the complete opponent lists for those point totals.
