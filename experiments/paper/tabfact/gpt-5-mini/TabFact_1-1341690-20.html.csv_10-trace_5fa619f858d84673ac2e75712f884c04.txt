Claim interpreted: “Parren Mitchell be re-elected for the district Maryland 8.” I interpret this as asserting that Parren J. Mitchell was re-elected to the U.S. House representing Maryland’s 8th congressional district.

Data sources explored:
- postgres_tabfact2, schema public
  - Table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns: district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates)

Evidence gathered:
1) Identify Maryland entries and Parren Mitchell’s district and 1974 result
SQL executed:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
WHERE district ILIKE 'Maryland%' OR district ILIKE '%Maryland%';

Returned rows (excerpt relevant to Parren Mitchell):
- district: maryland 7 | incumbent: parren mitchell | party: democratic | first elected: 1970 | result: re - elected | candidates: parren mitchell (d) unopposed

Context from the same query (other Maryland districts present in 1974 table):
- maryland 1: robert bauman — re - elected
- maryland 2: clarence long — re - elected
- maryland 4: marjorie holt — re - elected
- maryland 6: goodloe byron — re - elected

2) Check whether a record for “maryland 8” exists in the 1974 table
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT district FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 ORDER BY district LIMIT 200;

Result (Maryland districts present): maryland 1, maryland 2, maryland 4, maryland 6, maryland 7. No “maryland 8”.

SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district = 'maryland 8';

Result: cnt = 0

Findings:
- The 1974 election table shows Parren Mitchell as the incumbent for “maryland 7,” with result “re - elected,” and no record exists for “maryland 8” in that table.
- Therefore, based on the accessible authoritative data, Parren Mitchell was re-elected for Maryland’s 7th district (not the 8th) in 1974, and there is no evidence in this dataset of him being re-elected for Maryland’s 8th district.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Parren Mitchell was re-elected for “district Maryland 8” is not supported by the data. The available evidence shows re-election in Maryland’s 7th district in 1974, and no Maryland 8 record is present in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The available dataset covers U.S. House elections for the year 1974 only. I treated it as authoritative for that year.
- District labels in the table are lowercase (e.g., “maryland 7”). Matching for Maryland entries used a case-insensitive filter on the district text.
- If the claim intended a different year, that information is not present in the accessible data; conclusions are therefore limited to the 1974 cycle represented in the dataset.
