Objective
Verify the claim: "the utah jazz have 3 player from the united state."

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster

Schema summary (from metadata)
- Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence
1) Distribution of players by nationality
Executed SQL:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE nationality IS NOT NULL AND trim(nationality) <> ''
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY player_count DESC, nationality;

Result (nationality — player_count):
- united states — 6
- brazil — 1
- england — 1
- puerto rico — 1

2) Case-insensitive count of United States players
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_us_players
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE lower(trim(nationality)) = 'united states';

Result:
- distinct_us_players = 6

3) Names of players listed with nationality = United States (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE nationality ILIKE 'united states'
ORDER BY player ASC;

Result (players):
- anthony avent
- isaac austin
- j j anderson
- louis amundson
- rick adelman
- shandon anderson

Assessment
- The data in the authoritative table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster shows 6 distinct players with nationality recorded as "united states," not 3.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. The Utah Jazz have 6 players from the United States in this dataset, not 3.

Assumptions and notes
- Interpreted the claim against the available dataset (all-time roster) rather than a current-season roster.
- Nationality values in the table are lowercase (e.g., "united states"); case-insensitive matching was used to avoid case issues.
- Counts are of distinct player names as stored in the table.
