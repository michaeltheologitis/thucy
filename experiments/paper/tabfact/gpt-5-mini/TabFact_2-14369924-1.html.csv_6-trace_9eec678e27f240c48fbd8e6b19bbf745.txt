Claim to verify:
- The frequency MHz for call sign W269AX and the frequency for call sign W273AE are 93.9 FM and 105.9 FM, respectively.

Data source discovery:
- Found one accessible PostgreSQL data asset: postgres_tabfact9 (public schema).

Schema overview (public schema):
- Table: wyfk
  - Columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (text), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text)

Evidence queries and results:
1) SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" IN ('W269AX','W273AE');
Result:
- W269AX -> 101.7
- W273AE -> 102.5

2) SQL executed (case-insensitive check with full rows):
SELECT * FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w269ax','w273ae');
Result rows:
- call sign: w269ax; frequency mhz: 101.7 fm; city of license: anniston , alabama; erp w: 10; class: d; fcc info: fcc
- call sign: w273ae; frequency mhz: 102.5 fm; city of license: albany , georgia; erp w: 55; class: d; fcc info: fcc

3) SQL executed (duplicate check to ensure no conflicting entries):
SELECT "call sign","frequency mhz","city of license","erp w","class","fcc info", count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY "call sign","frequency mhz","city of license","erp w","class","fcc info") AS dup_count FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w269ax','w273ae') ORDER BY lower("call sign"), "frequency mhz";
Result:
- w269ax; 101.7 fm; anniston , alabama; 10; d; fcc; dup_count: 1
- w273ae; 102.5 fm; albany , georgia; 55; d; fcc; dup_count: 1

Findings:
- The database lists W269AX at 101.7 FM and W273AE at 102.5 FM.
- No alternative or duplicate entries suggest different frequencies for these call signs in the available data.

Conclusion:
- The claim that W269AX is 93.9 FM and W273AE is 105.9 FM is not supported by the data; the recorded frequencies are 101.7 FM and 102.5 FM, respectively.

Assumptions:
- Call signs were matched case-insensitively to ensure retrieval regardless of stored case.
- The wyfk table in the postgres_tabfact9 public schema is considered authoritative for station frequency information.
- The "frequency mhz" field values include the "fm" suffix as stored in the dataset.
