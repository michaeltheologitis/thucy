Claim to verify: "the chicago black hawk be the visitor team when the record be 2 - 3 on april 17"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact Postgres with one accessible table: public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season (assumed to contain the 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks season schedule/results).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm the table exists
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name ILIKE '%1965%chicago%black%hawks%';
Result:
[{"table_name":"t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season"}]

2) Inspect table columns
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season';
Result:
[{"column_name":"date","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"visitor","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"score","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"home","data_type":"text"},{"column_name":"record","data_type":"text"}]

3) Find any game(s) on April 17
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Apr%17%' OR date ILIKE '%April 17%' OR date ILIKE '%Apr. 17%' OR date ILIKE '%17 Apr%';
Result:
[{"date":"april 17","home":"chicago black hawks","record":"2 - 3","score":"5 - 3","visitor":"detroit red wings"}]
Interpretation: On April 17, the table shows Chicago Black Hawks as the home team, opponent Detroit Red Wings, score 5 - 3, and the record listed as 2 - 3.

4) Explicit check for April 17 with Chicago as the visitor and record 2–3
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE date ILIKE 'april 17' AND visitor ILIKE '%chicago%' AND record ILIKE '%2%3%';
Result:
null
Interpretation: There is no row on April 17 where Chicago is the visiting team with record 2 - 3.

Conclusion
- The only April 17 entry in the available data shows Chicago Black Hawks as the home team with a record of 2 - 3. There is no entry where they are the visiting team on that date with that record.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "chicago black hawk" refers to the Chicago Black Hawks (team name as listed in the table).
- Matching treated variations like "Apr 17" and "April 17" equivalently and treated different dash characters ("-" vs "–") as equivalent in the record string.
- Verification is scoped to the accessible table for the 1965–66 season, which contains an entry labeled "april 17."
