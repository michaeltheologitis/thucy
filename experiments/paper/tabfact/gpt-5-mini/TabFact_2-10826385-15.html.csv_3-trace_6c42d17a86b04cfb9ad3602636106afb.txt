Claim to verify: “the average of all the home team score be 15.67.”

Data discovery and context
- Available data source: postgres_tabfact4 (PostgreSQL), schema public.
- Relevant table: public."t_1972_vfl_season"
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).

Step 1: Inspect what “home team score” looks like and how many rows exist
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team score" FROM public."t_1972_vfl_season" LIMIT 20;
  Result values (table only has 6 rows):
  - 14.7 (91)
  - 16.14 (110)
  - 13.12 (90)
  - 20.8 (128)
  - 19.14 (128)
  - 10.13 (73)

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public."t_1972_vfl_season";
  Result:
  - count: 6

- Format check (goals.behinds (total points))
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "home team score" ~ '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ \([0-9]+\)$') AS matches, COUNT(*) AS total FROM public."t_1972_vfl_season";
  Result:
  - matches: 6, total: 6
  Interpretation: Every value follows G.B (P), e.g., 14.7 (91) = 14 goals, 7 behinds, 91 points.

Step 2: Compute averages under common interpretations
- Executed SQL (exact query):
  SELECT count(*) AS row_count,
  ROUND(avg((regexp_replace("home team score", E'^([0-9]+)\\..*$', E'\\1')::int)::numeric),2) AS avg_goals,
  ROUND(avg((regexp_replace("home team score", E'^[0-9]+\\.([0-9]+).*$', E'\\1')::int)::numeric),2) AS avg_behinds,
  ROUND(avg((regexp_replace("home team score", E'^.*\\(([0-9]+)\\).*$', E'\\1')::int)::numeric),2) AS avg_points
  FROM public."t_1972_vfl_season";

  Results:
  - row_count: 6
  - Average home-team goals: 15.33
  - Average home-team behinds: 11.33
  - Average home-team total points: 103.33

Assessment of the claim
- If “home team score” means goals: average is 15.33, not 15.67.
- If it means total points: average is 103.33, not 15.67.
- If it means behinds: average is 11.33, not 15.67.
- No reasonable parsing of the “home team score” field yields an average of 15.67 for this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data in public."t_1972_vfl_season".

Assumptions
- Interpreted “home team score” using the observed format G.B (P) and computed averages for goals, behinds, and total points.
- Verified against all rows available in the discovered dataset (6 rows total).
- Rounded averages to 2 decimal places to align with the claim’s precision.
