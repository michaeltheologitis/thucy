Claim to verify: “there be more than 2 zakspeed chassis make in the year 1987.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.zakspeed with columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm available years in the Zakspeed table
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.zakspeed ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989

2) Retrieve the Zakspeed entry for 1987
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1987;
- Result (one row):
  { year: 1987, chassis: "zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871", "engine (s)": "zakspeed s4 t / c", tyres: "g", points: 2 }
  Interpretation: The chassis field lists two chassis names for 1987: “zakspeed 861” and “zakspeed 871”.

3) Count the number of chassis names listed for 1987 (by counting occurrences of the substring “zakspeed”)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM(((length(lower(chassis)) - length(replace(lower(chassis),'zakspeed',''))) / length('zakspeed')::numeric))::bigint AS zakspeed_occurrences
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987;
- Result:
  zakspeed_occurrences = 2

4) (Supplementary) Count rows in 1987 that contain any chassis text mentioning Zakspeed
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_zakspeed
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987 AND lower(chassis) LIKE '%zakspeed%';
- Result:
  rows_with_zakspeed = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows two Zakspeed chassis listed for 1987: 861 and 871. Therefore, the number of Zakspeed chassis for 1987 is 2, which is not more than 2.

Final answer: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “chassis make in the year 1987” as the chassis listed in the zakspeed table for the 1987 season (i.e., chassis used/associated with Zakspeed in 1987). No additional semantics beyond what is present in the table were inferred.
