Claim interpreted: “Quentin is one of the police officers who is in the Cube (film series).”

Data source discovery
- Connected source: PostgreSQL (TabFact) with public.cube_film_series table.
- Table schema (from inspection): columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text). No keys or relationships.

Evidence 1 — Does the Cube series table list a character named Quentin and indicate he is a police officer?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, occupation, gender, "played by", status
  FROM public.cube_film_series
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Quentin%';
- Result:
  - name: quentin; occupation: police officer; gender: male; played by: maurice dean wint; status: dead.
- Interpretation: The table contains a character “quentin” whose occupation is explicitly “police officer,” matching the claim’s core point.

Evidence 2 — Does the table indeed represent the Cube film series characters?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "played by" FROM public.cube_film_series LIMIT 10;
- Sample results:
  - kazan — andrew miller
  - david worth — david hewlett
  - quentin — maurice dean wint
  - joan leaven — nicole de boer
  - dr helen holloway — nicky guadagni
  - rennes — wayne robson
- Interpretation: These are well-known characters and actors from the Cube film series, confirming the table context.

Assessment
- The data directly shows that Quentin is a character in the Cube series and that his occupation is “police officer.” This supports the claim that “Quentin [is] one of the police officers who [is] in the Cube.”

Assumptions
- “police offer” is interpreted as “police officer.”
- “in the cube” refers to being a character in the Cube film series (as represented by public.cube_film_series).
