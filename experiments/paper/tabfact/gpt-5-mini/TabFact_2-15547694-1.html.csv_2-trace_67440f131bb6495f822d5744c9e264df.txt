Claim interpreted: “University of Dublin is the only group of origin made up entirely of members from one party.” I interpret “group of origin” as the seat-origin categories in the 5th Seanad table (panels, universities, Taoiseach nominations) and “party” as values in the party column (including “independent”).

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: members_of_the_5th_seanad (party-level counts by origin category)

Step 1: Retrieve the full table
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Results (abridged to key columns and parties):
- fianna fáil: administrative 4; agricultural 4; cultural & educational 2; industrial & commercial 3; labour 0; NUI 1; University of Dublin 0; Taoiseach 7; total 21
- fine gael: administrative 1; agricultural 3; cultural & educational 2; industrial & commercial 2; labour 0; NUI 1; University of Dublin 0; Taoiseach 0; total 9
- labour party: administrative 0; agricultural 0; cultural & educational 0; industrial & commercial 1; labour 5; NUI 0; University of Dublin 0; Taoiseach 2; total 8
- clann na talmhan: administrative 0; agricultural 2; cultural & educational 0; industrial & commercial 0; labour 1; NUI 0; University of Dublin 0; Taoiseach 0; total 3
- independent: administrative 0; agricultural 1; cultural & educational 0; industrial & commercial 1; labour 0; NUI 1; University of Dublin 3; Taoiseach 3; total 9
- total row: administrative 7; agricultural 11; cultural & educational 5; industrial & commercial 9; labour 11; NUI 3; University of Dublin 3; Taoiseach 11; total 60

Step 2: For each origin, count how many distinct parties have non-zero members (excluding the total row)
1) Administrative panel
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "administrative panel" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 2; parties = ["fianna fáil", "fine gael"]

2) Agricultural panel
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "agricultural panel" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 4; parties = ["clann na talmhan", "fianna fáil", "fine gael", "independent"]

3) Cultural and educational panel
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "cultural and educational panel" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 2; parties = ["fianna fáil", "fine gael"]

4) Industrial and commercial panel
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "industrial and commercial panel" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 4; parties = ["fianna fáil", "fine gael", "independent", "labour party"]

5) Labour panel
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "labour panel" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 2; parties = ["clann na talmhan", "labour party"]

6) National University of Ireland
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "national university of ireland" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 3; parties = ["fianna fáil", "fine gael", "independent"]

7) University of Dublin
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "university of dublin" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 1; parties = ["independent"]

8) Nominated by the Taoiseach
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count, array_agg(party ORDER BY party) AS parties FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE "nominated by the taoiseach" <> 0 AND lower(party) <> 'total';
Result: count = 3; parties = ["fianna fáil", "independent", "labour party"]

Conclusion
- University of Dublin is the only origin group where all seats are held by a single party category (independent). All other origin groups have seats distributed across two or more parties. The claim is supported by the data for the 5th Seanad.

Assumptions
- “Group of origin” refers to the seat-origin categories in the table: the vocational panels, the two university constituencies, and Taoiseach nominations.
- “Party” includes the “independent” category as represented in the party column.
- The “total” summary row is excluded from party counts.
