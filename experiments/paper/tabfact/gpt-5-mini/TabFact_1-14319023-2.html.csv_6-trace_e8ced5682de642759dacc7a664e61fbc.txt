Summary of findings
- The claim appears to state: In 2009, the mixed doubles winners were Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu, and Hermansyah was the boys’ singles winner.
- Evidence from the authoritative dataset of Indonesian National Badminton Championships shows:
  - In 2009: Mixed doubles = didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu; Boys’ singles = riyanto subagja.
  - “Hermansyah” appears as the boys’ singles winner in 2008, not 2009.

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Retrieve 2009 results
- SQL:
  SELECT year, "mixed doubles", "boys singles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
- Result:
  - year: 2009
  - mixed doubles: didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu
  - boys singles: riyanto subagja

2) Check where “Hermansyah” appears in boys’ singles across all years
- SQL:
  SELECT year, "boys singles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "boys singles" ILIKE '%hermansyah%';
- Result:
  - year: 2008, boys singles: hermansyah

3) Retrieve 2008 results (for context)
- SQL:
  SELECT year, "mixed doubles", "boys singles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2008;
- Result:
  - year: 2008
  - mixed doubles: irfan fadhilah weni anggraeni
  - boys singles: hermansyah

Conclusion
- True: In 2009, the mixed doubles winners were Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu.
- False: In 2009, the boys’ singles winner was not Hermansyah; it was Riyanto Subagja. Hermansyah was the boys’ singles winner in 2008.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Indonesian National Badminton Championships.
- “Mixed double consists of” means the mixed doubles winning pair.
- “Boy single” refers to the boys’ singles event/winner.
