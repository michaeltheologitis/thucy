Data source discovery

Schema verified

  Columns: "no overall", "no for series", "title", "directed by", "written by", "original air date", "uk viewers (million)"

Evidence from data
Results (ordered by episode number within the series):
1) title: the witchfinder | no for series: 7 | original air date: 7 november 2009
2) title: sweet dreams   | no for series: 10 | original air date: 28 november 2009

Executed SQL (as evidence)
1) Confirm table exists:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name ILIKE '%merlin%';

2) Confirm column names:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='merlin_series_2';

3) Retrieve the episodes and their numbers within the series:
SELECT title, "no for series", "original air date" FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE title ILIKE '%sweet%' OR title ILIKE '%witchfinder%' ORDER BY "no for series";

Assessment
- “The Witchfinder” is episode 7 in Merlin Series 2.
- “Sweet Dreams” is episode 10 in Merlin Series 2.
- Therefore, “Sweet Dreams” happens later in the series than “The Witchfinder.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to BBC’s Merlin (Series 2) episode titles “The Witchfinder” and “Sweet Dreams.”
- Title matching was case-insensitive to align with stored lowercase titles in the dataset.
