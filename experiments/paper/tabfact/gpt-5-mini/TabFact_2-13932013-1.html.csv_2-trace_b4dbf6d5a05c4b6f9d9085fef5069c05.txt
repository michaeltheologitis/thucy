Claim interpreted: “The Cleveland Browns have tied a total of 10 games.”

Data sources discovered:
- TabFact PostgreSQL instance containing a table relevant to the Browns: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks (columns: quarterback, uniform no (s), games started, wins, losses, ties, winning pct).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Total franchise ties (via summing ties credited to each starting QB)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM(ties) AS total_ties FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;
- Result: total_ties = 10

2) Consistency check (wins + losses + ties vs. games started)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM("games started") AS games_started_sum, SUM(wins) AS wins_sum, SUM(losses) AS losses_sum, SUM(ties) AS ties_sum, (SUM(wins)+SUM(losses)+SUM(ties)) AS wl_ties_sum, (SUM(wins)+SUM(losses)+SUM(ties) = SUM("games started")) AS equal_flag FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;
- Result: games_started_sum = 883; wins_sum = 451; losses_sum = 422; ties_sum = 10; wl_ties_sum = 883; equal_flag = true
- Interpretation: The dataset is internally consistent; ties_sum = 10 corroborates the total from query (1).

Conclusion: The available data shows the Cleveland Browns have 10 ties (as counted across all starts by their starting quarterbacks in this dataset).

Assumptions made:
- The “ties” column in the table reflects the team’s regular-season ties in games started by each quarterback. Since every game has a starting quarterback, summing ties across all starters yields the team’s total ties represented in this dataset. Postseason games are typically excluded from such tables; the claim did not specify regular season vs postseason, so this verification pertains to regular-season ties represented in the table.
