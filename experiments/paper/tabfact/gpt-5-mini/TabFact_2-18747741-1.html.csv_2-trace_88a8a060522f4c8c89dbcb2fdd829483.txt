Claim interpreted: The user appears to be asserting or asking about the Chicago Bears’ opponent on December 5, 1983. I searched the available data for any record of an NFL game on that date and for any tables that could record Chicago Bears schedules/opponents.

Data sources discovered:
- Verified accessible source: PostgreSQL database TabFact, public schema.

Schema inspection:
- I listed all tables in the public schema to locate any Chicago Bears-related season/schedule table.
Tool and output:
- Schema query response: only one table exists:
  - t_1983_detroit_lions_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance)
- No tables with names containing "bears" or "chicago" were found.

Evidence of games on December 5, 1983 in available data:
- I queried the only available NFL-related table (Detroit Lions 1983 season) for December entries and specifically for December 5, 1983.

Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL to list December entries in 1983 Detroit Lions season:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Dec%';
Result (relevant row):
- week = 14, date = "december 5 , 1983", opponent = "minnesota vikings", result = "w 13 - 2", attendance = 79169

2) SQL to confirm the exact December 5, 1983 row:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE date ILIKE 'december 5 , 1983';
Result:
- week = 14, date = "december 5 , 1983", opponent = "minnesota vikings", result = "w 13 - 2", attendance = 79169

Assessment relative to the claim:
- The available database contains only the Detroit Lions’ 1983 season table. There is no Chicago Bears season/schedule table to directly verify the Bears’ opponent on December 5, 1983.
- The only game recorded on December 5, 1983 in the accessible data is Detroit Lions vs. Minnesota Vikings. This does not provide evidence about a Chicago Bears opponent on that date. Therefore, the claim (that pertains to a Chicago Bears opponent on Dec 5, 1983) is unsupported by the available data.

Conclusion:
- Based on the accessible data, I cannot verify that the Chicago Bears had an opponent/game on December 5, 1983. The only evidenced game on that date in the dataset is Detroit vs. Minnesota.

Assumptions and notes:
- I assumed the intent was to identify or verify the Chicago Bears’ opponent on December 5, 1983.
- I treated the TabFact database as the sole authoritative source available through these tools. No Chicago Bears table exists in this environment, so I could not corroborate a Bears game/opponent for that date.
