Claim to verify: "no other game have total rebound smaller than 1048"

Data sources explored
- Available database: postgres_tabfact8 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: rank, player, years, games, reb avg, total rebounds

Findings grounded in data
1) What is the minimum "total rebounds" in the table?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("total rebounds") AS min_total_rebounds FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: min_total_rebounds = 708
- Interpretation: The smallest total rebounds value is 708, which is less than 1048.

2) Are there any records with "total rebounds" < 1048, and how many?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_lt_1048, (COUNT(*) > 0) AS any_exist
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE "total rebounds" < 1048;
- Result: count_lt_1048 = 9, any_exist = true
- Interpretation: There are 9 records with total rebounds less than 1048.

3) List the records with "total rebounds" < 1048
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "total rebounds" < 1048 ORDER BY "total rebounds" ASC;
- Rows returned (ordered ascending by total rebounds):
  - jesse young | games: 115 | reb avg: 6.2 | total rebounds: 708 | rank: 10 | years: 1999 - 2003
  - herb estes  | games: 80  | reb avg: 9.2 | total rebounds: 734 | rank: 9  | years: 1973 - 1976
  - rob rose    | games: 113 | reb avg: 7.1 | total rebounds: 805 | rank: 8  | years: 1982 - 1986
  - jai lewis   | games: 125 | reb avg: 7.2 | total rebounds: 895 | rank: 7  | years: 2002 - 2006
  - andre gaddy | games: 98  | reb avg: 9.3 | total rebounds: 916 | rank: 6  | years: 1977 - 1982
  - robert dykes| games: 122 | reb avg: 7.5 | total rebounds: 925 | rank: 5  | years: 1987 - 1991

  - kenny sanders| games:107 | reb avg: 9.6 | total rebounds: 1026| rank: 2  | years: 1985 - 1989

4) Context around 1048
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, games, "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY "total rebounds" ASC;
- Relevant excerpt (ascending):
  - ...
  - kenny sanders | games: 107 | total rebounds: 1026
  - jim nowers    | games: 112 | total rebounds: 1048

Conclusion
- The data clearly shows multiple records with total rebounds less than 1048 (minimum is 708; 9 rows are below 1048). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "game" in the claim as referring to records in public.my_info_table (which are player records) and evaluated the condition using the "total rebounds" column.
- Treated "smaller than 1048" as a strict numeric comparison (< 1048).
