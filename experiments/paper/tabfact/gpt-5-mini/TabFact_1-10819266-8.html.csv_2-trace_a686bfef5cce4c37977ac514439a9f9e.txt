Claim interpreted: The 2007–2008 TV season (for the CSI franchise table available) has a season premiere on September 26, 2007.

Data source discovery and schema grounding
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.csi_franchise

Executed SQL evidence
1) Verify table structure (to understand available fields)
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'csi_franchise'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result (abridged): season; episodes; time slot (est); season premiere; season finale; tv season; rank; viewers (in millions)

2) Broad search for any 2007 season premieres to locate the relevant row
SQL:
SELECT season, "tv season", "season premiere"
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE "season premiere" ILIKE '%2007%'
ORDER BY season;
Result: { season: 4, tv season: '2007 - 2008', season premiere: 'september 26 , 2007' }

3) Direct exact-match verification (case/whitespace-normalized)
SQL:
SELECT season, episodes, "time slot (est)", "season premiere", "season finale", "tv season", rank, "viewers (in millions)"
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE regexp_replace(lower("season premiere"), '\s+', ' ', 'g') = 'september 26 , 2007';
Result:
- season: 4
- episodes: 21
- time slot (est): wednesday 10 pm / 9c
- season premiere: september 26 , 2007
- season finale: may 21 , 2008
- tv season: 2007 - 2008
- rank: 28
- viewers (in millions): 11.71

4) Containment check (case-insensitive) confirming the same row
SQL:
SELECT season, episodes, "time slot (est)", "season premiere", "season finale", "tv season", rank, "viewers (in millions)"
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE lower("season premiere") LIKE '%september 26%' AND lower("season premiere") LIKE '%2007%';
Result: same as Query 3 (season 4; tv season: 2007 - 2008; season premiere: september 26 , 2007)

Conclusion
- The data explicitly shows a row where the TV season is 2007 - 2008 and the season premiere date is September 26, 2007. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data in the CSI franchise table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the season data represented in the available public.csi_franchise table. The table does not include a series-name column; findings are limited to what this table records.
