Summary conclusion: Verified. The available data shows Army (Black Knights/Cadets) scored 54 points against Lehigh on Sept 20 and their record after the game was 2 - 0.

Data source discovery and context
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team (game-by-game log for the 1975 Army Cadets/Black Knights season, including date, opponent, points, and post-game record)

Evidence via executed SQL
1) Identify the exact opponent string values in the table
SQL:
SELECT opponent FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team ORDER BY game;
Output:
[{"opponent":"holy cross"},{"opponent":"lehigh"},{"opponent":"villanova"},{"opponent":"stanford"},{"opponent":"duke"},{"opponent":"pittsburgh"},{"opponent":"penn state"},{"opponent":"air force"},{"opponent":"boston college"},{"opponent":"vanderbilt"}]

2) Retrieve the row for the Lehigh game with date, points, result, and record
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "black knights points", opponents, result, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent = 'lehigh';
Output:
[{"black knights points":54,"date":"sept 20","opponent":"lehigh","opponents":32,"record":"2 - 0","result":"win"}]

How the evidence maps to the claim
- "score 54 point": black knights points = 54 → Supported
- "against lehigh": opponent = lehigh → Supported
- "on september 20th": date = "sept 20" → Supported (format matches the day/month)
- "raise their record to 2 - 0": record = "2 - 0" with result = "win" → Supported

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the black knight" as referring to the Army football team (Black Knights/Cadets). The data pertains to the 1975 season, which is the available authoritative source in the connected database. The claim did not specify a year; verification is based on this season’s record in the data.
