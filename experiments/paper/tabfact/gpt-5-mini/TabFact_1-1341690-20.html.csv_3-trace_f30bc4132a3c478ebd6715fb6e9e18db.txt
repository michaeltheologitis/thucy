Claim interpreted: The statement suggests that Parren Mitchell was re-elected (i.e., won another term) for Maryland’s 7th congressional district in 1970.

What the data shows:
- From a reliable elections table for 1974, the record for Maryland’s 7th district lists the incumbent as “parren mitchell,” with “first elected: 1970” and “result: re - elected” for 1974. This indicates 1970 was his initial election year, not a re-election year.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Maryland 7th district record (1974 table):
Result:
- district: maryland 7
- incumbent: parren mitchell
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1970
- result: re - elected
- candidates: parren mitchell (d) unopposed
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
WHERE district ILIKE '%Maryland%' AND district LIKE '%7%';

2) Cross-check rows mentioning “parren” as incumbent in the 1974 table:
Result:
- district: maryland 7
- incumbent: parren mitchell
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1970
- result: re - elected
- candidates: parren mitchell (d) unopposed
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%parren%';

Conclusion:
- The data explicitly states Parren Mitchell was first elected in 1970. Therefore, he was not re-elected in 1970; rather, 1970 was his initial election to the seat. The 1974 entry shows he was re-elected in 1974 (and likely in 1972 as well, though that is not directly shown in the available table).

Assumptions:
- “maryland 7” refers to Maryland’s 7th U.S. House district.
- The column “first elected” denotes the year the listed incumbent first won the seat.
- The 1974 table accurately reflects incumbency status and first election year, which we used to infer the 1970 outcome.
