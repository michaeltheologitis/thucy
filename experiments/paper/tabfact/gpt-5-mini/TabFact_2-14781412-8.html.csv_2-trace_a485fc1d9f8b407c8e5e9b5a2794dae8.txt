Analysis
- The earliest recorded equestrian entry in the dataset is 1982 (New Delhi), and the gold medalist for that year is “nadia al - moutawaa.”
- Therefore, within this authoritative dataset, Nadia Al-Moutawaa is the first recorded gold medalist in equestrian at the Asian Games.

- The claim is supported by the data: Nadia Al-Moutawaa is the first person listed as winning gold in equestrian at the Asian Games (earliest year present is 1982, with her as gold).

Assumptions
- The table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games comprehensively lists the first occurrence/year for Asian Games equestrian gold medalists, and the earliest year in the table represents the first such gold medal at the Asian Games for this event category.
- Name spellings and punctuation are taken as-is from the dataset (e.g., “nadia al - moutawaa”).
