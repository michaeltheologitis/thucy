What I checked
- Available data sources: I discovered one relational source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact postgres_tabfact28) with a single relevant table: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes (episodes of the TV series White Collar, including a “directed by” column).

Schema recap
- Table: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
  Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text)

Evidence 1: Episodes directed by Paul Holahan (with inferred season within the dataset)
SQL executed:
WITH computed AS (
  SELECT
    "no in series" AS no_in_series,
    "no in season" AS no_in_season,
    SUM(CASE WHEN "no in season" = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (ORDER BY "no in series" ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING) AS inferred_season,
    title,
    "directed by" AS directed_by
  FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
)
SELECT *
FROM computed
WHERE directed_by ILIKE '%Paul Holahan%'
ORDER BY no_in_series;
Results (no_in_series | no_in_season | inferred_season | title | directed_by):
- 47 | 1  | 1 | wanted | paul holahan
- 48 | 2  | 1 | most wanted | paul holahan
- 53 | 7  | 1 | compromising positions | paul holahan
- 57 | 11 | 1 | family business | paul holahan
Interpretation: In this dataset, Paul Holahan is credited as director on four episodes, all within the same contiguous season represented in the data subset.

Evidence 2: Scope of the dataset (to understand season coverage)
(1) Total rows
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes;
Result: total_rows = 15

(2) Maximum "no in series"
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX("no in series") AS max_no_in_series FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes;
Result: max_no_in_series = 61

(3) Count of rows where "no in season" = 1 (start-of-season markers within this dataset)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_no_in_season_eq_1 FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in season" = 1;
Result: count_no_in_season_eq_1 = 1

(4) First 15 rows (the entire dataset here) ordered by "no in series"
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", "title" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes ORDER BY "no in series" LIMIT 15;
Results (selected columns):
47: (no_in_season 1) wanted
48: (2) most wanted
49: (3) diminishing returns
50: (4) parting shots
51: (5) honor among thieves
52: (6) identity crisis
53: (7) compromising positions
54: (8) ancient history
55: (9) gloves off
56: (10) vested interest
57: (11) family business
58: (12) brass tacks
59: (13) empire city
60: (14) shoot the moon
61: (15) the original
Interpretation: The table holds a contiguous run of 15 episodes with no_in_series 47–61 and only one row where no_in_season = 1, indicating that this dataset covers a single season’s worth of episodes (within this subset). Therefore, any season numbering we infer is relative to this subset and does not reveal the absolute season number (e.g., it could be season 4 of the full series, but the table alone does not declare that).

Conclusion
- The available data show Paul Holahan directed four episodes within the single season represented in the dataset. This single season is necessarily within the range “season 1 through season 6” if referring to White Collar’s typical numbering, but the dataset does not contain episodes outside this one season, so it cannot confirm or deny whether he directed in other seasons or outside seasons 1–6 overall.
- Consequently, the claim as stated cannot be fully verified from the provided data; we can only confirm he directed episodes within the one season in this dataset.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity in the claim)
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the TV series White Collar (the only series represented in the available data) and that “only direct episode for season 1 through season 6” means “Paul Holahan’s directing work on this show falls within seasons 1–6 and not outside that range.”
- The inferred season number in Evidence 1 is relative to the subset covered by the table (episodes no_in_series 47–61), not the show’s absolute season numbering.
- No external sources beyond the provided database were used.
