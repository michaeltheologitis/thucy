Claim to verify: “bridgenorth have the highest number of win in the ntfa div with 15 win and only 3 loss.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database, schema public, table my_info_table (discovered via data source exploration).

Schema inspected:
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: "ntfa div 1" (text), wins (bigint), byes (bigint), losses (bigint), draws (bigint), against (bigint)

Evidence 1 — standings sorted by wins:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team, wins, losses, draws, byes
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE "ntfa div 1" IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY wins DESC NULLS LAST, losses ASC NULLS LAST;
- Results (top to bottom):
  - bridgenorth — wins: 15, losses: 3, draws: 0, byes: 0
  - rocherlea — wins: 13, losses: 5, draws: 0, byes: 0
  - bracknell — wins: 12, losses: 5, draws: 1, byes: 0
  - george town — wins: 9, losses: 8, draws: 1, byes: 0
  - scottsdale — wins: 8, losses: 10, draws: 0, byes: 0
  - deloraine — wins: 6, losses: 10, draws: 2, byes: 0
  - longford — wins: 5, losses: 12, draws: 1, byes: 0
  - hillwood — wins: 1, losses: 16, draws: 1, byes: 0
- Takeaway: Bridgenorth leads the table with the most wins (15) and has 3 losses.

Evidence 2 — maximum wins and team(s) holding it:
- Executed SQL (max wins):
  SELECT MAX(wins) AS max_wins FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: max_wins = 15

- Executed SQL (teams with max wins):
  SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team, wins, losses
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE wins = (SELECT MAX(wins) FROM public.my_info_table);
- Result: team: bridgenorth, wins: 15, losses: 3
- Takeaway: The highest wins total is 15, held by Bridgenorth, with 3 losses.

Assessment of the claim:
- “bridgenorth have the highest number of win” — Supported: 15 is the maximum wins and uniquely held by Bridgenorth.
- “in the ntfa div” — Supported by the dataset labeled “ntfa div 1”, interpreted as NTFA Division 1.
- “with 15 win and only 3 loss” — Supported: Bridgenorth has 15 wins and 3 losses.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data in public.my_info_table.

Assumptions:
- “ntfa div” refers to the dataset column “ntfa div 1”, representing NTFA Division 1.
- The table includes all relevant teams for this division and reflects final/official standings for the referenced season.
- Team name matching is case-insensitive (e.g., “bridgenorth”).
