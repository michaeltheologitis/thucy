Claim to verify: "every team have several win" (interpreted as: every team has several wins).

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.c_sar_ramos with columns: season (bigint), series (text), team (text), races (bigint), wins (bigint), poles (bigint), f / laps (bigint), podiums (bigint), points (text), position (text).

Verification approach
- Aggregate total wins per team across all rows in public.c_sar_ramos.
- Treat NULL wins as 0.
- Check whether every team’s total wins meet or exceed a “several” threshold (we note the results also contradict looser thresholds like ≥1 or ≥2, as some teams have 0 total wins).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count of distinct teams (non-null)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS distinct_team_count FROM public.c_sar_ramos WHERE team IS NOT NULL;
Result:
{ "distinct_team_count": 4 }

2) Total wins per team (NULL wins treated as 0), plus row counts
SQL executed:
SELECT team, SUM(COALESCE(wins,0)) AS total_wins, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.c_sar_ramos
WHERE team IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY total_wins DESC, team;
Results:
{ "team": "bvm minardi team", "total_wins": 4, "row_count": 5 }
{ "team": "bvm - target racing", "total_wins": 3, "row_count": 1 }
{ "team": "manor motorsport", "total_wins": 0, "row_count": 2 }
{ "team": "s fortec motorsport", "total_wins": 0, "row_count": 1 }

3) Teams with total wins < 3 (NULL wins treated as 0)
SQL executed:
SELECT team, SUM(COALESCE(wins,0)) AS total_wins
FROM public.c_sar_ramos
WHERE team IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY team
HAVING SUM(COALESCE(wins,0)) < 3
ORDER BY total_wins ASC, team;
Results:
{ "team": "manor motorsport", "total_wins": 0 }
{ "team": "s fortec motorsport", "total_wins": 0 }

Findings
- There are teams with 0 total wins (manor motorsport, s fortec motorsport). Therefore, it is not true that every team has “several” wins. This conclusion holds even under very lenient interpretations of “several” (e.g., ≥1 or ≥2), since some teams have 0 wins.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in public.c_sar_ramos.

Assumptions
- “Several” is interpreted as at least 3. Regardless, the presence of teams with 0 wins falsifies the claim under any reasonable interpretation (≥1, ≥2, or ≥3).
- Wins are summed across all rows per team in the table and NULL wins are treated as 0.
