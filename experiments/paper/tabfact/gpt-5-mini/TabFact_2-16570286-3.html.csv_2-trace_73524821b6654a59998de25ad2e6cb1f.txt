- Schema (via schema inspection):
  - Columns: player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Bill Johnston’s wickets
- SQL:
  SELECT player, team, matches, wickets, average, "best bowling" FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player ILIKE '%Bill Johnston%';

  - norman yardley — 9 wickets
  - jim laker — 9 wickets
- Finding: The maximum wickets by an England player in this series is 18 (Alec Bedser).

Analysis
- Bill Johnston’s wickets: 27
- Highest England wickets: 18
- Since 18 < 27, no England player took as many wickets as Bill Johnston in the 1948 Ashes series, according to the dataset.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data provided in public.t_1948_ashes_series.

Assumptions
