Claim interpreted: “A 2000 Steam Buggy themed coin by artist John Mordon is priced at 59.95.”

Data source discovery:
- Connected PostgreSQL instance with a single accessible table in the public schema: public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s.

Schema context (public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s):
- Columns: year (bigint), theme (text), artist (text), mintage (text), issue price (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate the 2000 “Steam Buggy” record and its issue price
SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage, "issue price" 
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s 
WHERE year = 2000 AND theme ILIKE '%steam buggy%';

Result (1 row):
- year: 2000
- theme: steam buggy
- artist: john mardon
- mintage: 44367
- issue price: 59.95

Assessment:
- Year and theme match the claim (2000, “Steam Buggy”).
- Issue price equals 59.95, matching the claimed price.
- Artist recorded as “john mardon”; claim states “john mordon.” This is a minor spelling discrepancy in the name; the data supports “john mardon.”

Conclusion: The coin is listed at an issue price of 59.95, and the record corresponds to the 2000 Steam Buggy theme coin. The artist’s name is “john mardon” per the data.

Assumptions:
- “be price at 59.95” refers to the issue price stored in the dataset.
- The mention of “john mordon” is interpreted as a misspelling of “john mardon,” consistent with the dataset entry.
