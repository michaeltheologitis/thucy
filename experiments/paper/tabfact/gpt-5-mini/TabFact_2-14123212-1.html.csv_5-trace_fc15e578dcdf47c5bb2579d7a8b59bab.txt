Scope and interpretation
- I explored the available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table relevant to radio frequencies (public.whlp).
- I interpret the claim “there be a 5 mhz frequency change range” as asserting that the dataset exhibits a 5 MHz frequency range or difference. I tested both the overall range (max − min) and whether any pair of entries differs by ~5.0 MHz.

Data discovery and schema evidence
- Data source discovery: A single PostgreSQL instance (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.whlp with a column named "frequency mhz" (double precision), indicating frequency values in MHz.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verified the column data type
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='whlp' AND column_name='frequency mhz';
Result:
[{"column_name":"frequency mhz","data_type":"double precision"}]

2) Compute overall range across the table
SQL:
SELECT MIN("frequency mhz") AS min_mhz, MAX("frequency mhz") AS max_mhz, (MAX("frequency mhz") - MIN("frequency mhz")) AS range_mhz, COUNT("frequency mhz") AS num_values
FROM public.whlp;
Result:
[{"max_mhz":106.5,"min_mhz":92.1,"num_values":6,"range_mhz":14.400000000000006}]
Interpretation: The overall frequency range is 14.4 MHz, not 5 MHz.

3) List all frequencies
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM public.whlp ORDER BY "frequency mhz" ASC;
Result (ordered):
- 92.1, 92.5, 95.9, 100.7, 103.1, 106.5
Adjacent differences: 0.4, 3.4, 4.8, 2.4, 3.4 MHz (none equals 5 MHz).

4) Check for any pair with ~5.0 MHz difference (±0.001 MHz tolerance)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.whlp a
JOIN public.whlp b ON a.ctid <> b.ctid AND a."frequency mhz" < b."frequency mhz"
WHERE abs(a."frequency mhz" - b."frequency mhz") BETWEEN 4.999 AND 5.001;
Result:
[{"match_count":0}]
No pair has a ~5.0 MHz difference.

Additional context: The closest differences to 5.0 MHz among all pairs are 4.8 MHz and 5.8 MHz (see below query and top results):
SQL:
SELECT a."frequency mhz" AS freq1, b."frequency mhz" AS freq2, abs(a."frequency mhz" - b."frequency mhz") AS diff
FROM public.whlp a
JOIN public.whlp b ON a.ctid <> b.ctid AND a."frequency mhz" < b."frequency mhz"
ORDER BY abs(abs(a."frequency mhz" - b."frequency mhz") - 5.0) ASC
LIMIT 10;
Result (top pairs):
[{"diff":4.799999999999997,"freq1":95.9,"freq2":100.7}, {"diff":5.799999999999997,"freq1":100.7,"freq2":106.5}, …]

Conclusion
- The dataset shows an overall frequency range of 14.4 MHz and no pair of entries separated by approximately 5.0 MHz. The claim that “there be a 5 mhz frequency change range” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the "frequency mhz" values in the public.whlp table of the TabFact database.
- “frequency change range” is interpreted as either the overall range (max − min) or the existence of any ~5.0 MHz pairwise difference within the dataset.
