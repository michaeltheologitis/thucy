Claim to verify: “there be a 4 way tie for the most lap at 75 with a 2 way tie for the least amount at 7.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact22 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid).

What the data shows
1) Distribution of laps values (to see ties and frequencies)
Executed SQL:
SELECT laps, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY laps
ORDER BY laps;

Result (laps => frequency):
5 => 2; 7 => 1; 22 => 1; 30 => 1; 31 => 2; 33 => 1; 42 => 1; 45 => 1; 56 => 1; 58 => 1; 75 => 1; 77 => 4; 78 => 4; 79 => 4

2) Maximum laps value and its frequency
Executed SQL:
SELECT laps, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix)
GROUP BY laps;

Result: laps = 79, freq = 4 (a 4‑way tie at 79, not 75)

3) Minimum laps value and its frequency
Executed SQL:
SELECT laps, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE laps = (SELECT MIN(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix)
GROUP BY laps;

Result: laps = 5, freq = 2 (a 2‑way tie at 5, not 7)

4) Rows with maximum and minimum laps (for completeness)
Executed SQLs and results:
- Get max laps:
  SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
  Result: max_laps = 79
- Rows with max laps:
  SELECT driver, constructor, laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
  Results:
    • mario andretti — ferrari — 79
    • jackie stewart — tyrrell - ford — 79
    • clay regazzoni — ferrari — 79
    • reine wisell — lotus - ford — 79
- Get min laps:
  SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
  Result: min_laps = 5
- Rows with min laps:
  SELECT driver, constructor, laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MIN(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
  Results:
    • jo bonnier — mclaren - ford — 5
    • alex soler - roig — march - ford — 5

Assessment of the claim
- “4 way tie for the most lap at 75”: Not supported. The highest laps value is 79, with a 4‑way tie. The laps value 75 appears once (no tie).
- “2 way tie for the least amount at 7”: Not supported. The lowest laps value is 5, with a 2‑way tie. The laps value 7 appears once.

Conclusion: The data contradicts both parts of the claim.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the laps distribution in the only accessible relevant table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix. If a different event/table was intended, please specify and I will re‑verify using that data.
