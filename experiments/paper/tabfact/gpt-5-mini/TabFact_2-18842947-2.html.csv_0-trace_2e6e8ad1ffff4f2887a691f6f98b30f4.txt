Summary
- Claim: "the lion finish with a record of 6 win and 8 loss"
- Finding: Supported by the available data for the 1976 Detroit Lions NFL season.

Data Source Exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance for the TabFact dataset with one relevant table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season.

Schema Snapshot
- Table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Executed Evidence Queries and Results
1) Inspect result formats
SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season GROUP BY result ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Results (each appears once):
- {"l 20 - 17", cnt: 1}
- {"w 30 - 10", cnt: 1}
- {"w 27 - 6", cnt: 1}
- {"l 10 - 9", cnt: 1}
- {"w 27 - 14", cnt: 1}
- {"l 31 - 23", cnt: 1}
- {"l 24 - 14", cnt: 1}
- {"l 24 - 10", cnt: 1}
- {"l 17 - 16", cnt: 1}
- {"l 10 - 3", cnt: 1}
- {"w 14 - 10", cnt: 1}
- {"l 20 - 7", cnt: 1}
- {"w 41 - 14", cnt: 1}
- {"w 24 - 10", cnt: 1}

2) Aggregate wins, losses, ties, total games
SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 't%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ties,
  COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result:
- wins: 6
- losses: 8
- ties: 0
- total_games: 14

Conclusion
- The table shows the team finished 6–8 with 14 total games and no ties. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- "the lion" refers to the Detroit Lions (NFL).
- The season referenced is 1976, as that is the available data table.
- "record" refers to regular-season wins and losses as captured in the table.
