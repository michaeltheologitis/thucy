Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Ray Lindwall took more wickets than Bill Johnston but had a worse (higher) bowling average.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema). Identified relevant table: public.t_1948_ashes_series with columns [player, team, matches, wickets, average, best bowling].

Evidence from the database:
1) Context/sample rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series LIMIT 10;
Returned rows (relevant excerpts):
- player: ray lindwall, team: australia, matches: 5, wickets: 27, average: 19.62, best bowling: 6 / 20
- player: bill johnston, team: australia, matches: 5, wickets: 27, average: 23.33, best bowling: 5 / 36

2) Direct comparison query
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, wickets, average FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player ILIKE '%lindwall%' OR player ILIKE '%johnston%';
Results:
- ray lindwall — wickets: 27, average: 19.62
- bill johnston — wickets: 27, average: 23.33

Assessment against the claim:
- Wickets: Ray Lindwall did not take a higher number of wickets than Bill Johnston; both have 27 in this dataset. This contradicts the claim.
- Bowling average: A lower bowling average is better. Ray Lindwall’s average (19.62) is better (lower) than Bill Johnston’s (23.33). The claim that Lindwall had a “bad” (worse/higher) average is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data for the 1948 Ashes series.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- Scope: Verification is grounded in the available table public.t_1948_ashes_series, which appears to capture statistics for the 1948 Ashes series specifically—not career totals. If the intended claim was about career Test statistics, that is a different scope; this verification is limited to the accessible dataset. The executed SQL and results above reflect this scope.
