Claim to verify: “In season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the least viewed episode of the season is the finale, which aired on May 20, 2009.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact, schema: public) with table public.gary_unmarried.
- Table schema (key columns): episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision).

Key checks and evidence
1) Confirm the dataset covers a single season and episode count
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.gary_unmarried;
- Result: total_rows = 20
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episodes_listed FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE episode IS NOT NULL AND trim(episode) <> '';
- Result: episodes_listed = 20
Interpretation: The table lists 20 episodes, consistent with a single season run for Season 1.

2) Find the minimum viewers value and the episode(s) at that minimum
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MIN(viewers) AS min_viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried;
- Result: min_viewers = 5.55
- SQL executed (no hard-coded value):
  SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot, "18 - 49", viewers
  FROM public.gary_unmarried
  WHERE viewers = (SELECT MIN(viewers) FROM public.gary_unmarried);
- Result row:
  episode: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal
  air date: may 20 , 2009
  timeslot: wednesday 8:30 pm
  18 - 49: 1.7 / 5
  viewers: 5.55
Interpretation: The least viewed episode has 5.55 million viewers and is “gary fixes allison’s garbage disposal,” with an air date of May 20, 2009.

3) Confirm that this episode is the season finale (last aired chronologically)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT episode, "air date", viewers, to_date(initcap(trim(regexp_replace("air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', '))), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.gary_unmarried
  ORDER BY parsed_date DESC
  LIMIT 1;
- Result:
  episode: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal
  air date: may 20 , 2009
  parsed_date: 2009-05-20
  viewers: 5.55
Interpretation: The chronologically last-aired episode (i.e., the finale) is the same episode, aired on 2009-05-20.

Conclusion
- The data shows the least viewed episode (5.55 million viewers) is “gary fixes allison’s garbage disposal.”
- This episode is also the last aired in the dataset (finale) and aired on May 20, 2009.
Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The table public.gary_unmarried corresponds to Season 1 of Gary Unmarried. The presence of exactly 20 episodes aligns with the known Season 1 count.
- “air date” is stored as text and was normalized and parsed to determine chronological order.
- “viewers” values are in millions (as commonly reported for TV ratings).
