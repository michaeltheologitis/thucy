Claim interpreted: On Intel AMT 3.0, is the VLAN setting for the Intel AMT network interface feature available?

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact18), schema public, containing a table: intel_amt_versions. This table lists AMT features (rows) versus AMT versions (columns), including “amt 3.0 (desktop)”. No other relevant tables were found.

Evidence from the data:
1) Targeted search for any VLAN-related feature and its AMT 3.0 availability
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT feature, "amt 3.0 (desktop)" FROM intel_amt_versions WHERE feature ILIKE '%vlan%';
- Result:
  feature: vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces
  amt 3.0 (desktop): yes

2) Full row for the VLAN feature across versions (for context)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.intel_amt_versions WHERE feature ILIKE '%vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces%';
- Result row:
  feature: vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces
  amt 1.0 (desktop): no
  amt 2.0 / 2.1 (desktop): no
  amt 2.5 / 2.6 (mobile): no
  amt 3.0 (desktop): yes
  amt 4.0 (mobile): no
  amt 5.0 (desktop): yes
  6.0 (desktop & mobile): yes
  7.0 & 8.0 (desktop & mobile): yes

Conclusion:
- The data shows “vlan settings for intel amt network interfaces” is available (“yes”) in AMT 3.0 (desktop). Therefore, the claim that this feature is available on AMT 3.0 is supported.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to Intel AMT 3.0 as represented in the dataset’s “amt 3.0 (desktop)” column. The dataset does not list a separate 3.0 mobile column, so the conclusion pertains to AMT 3.0 (desktop).
