Claim interpreted: The record(s) with incoming head coach “Carlos Azenha” should have a date of vacancy after 28 December 2011.

Data source discovery:
- Available DB: postgres_tabfact19 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga (columns include team, outgoing head coach, date of vacancy, incoming head coach, date of appointment)

Evidence and queries:
1) Locate rows with incoming head coach Carlos Azenha:
SQL:
SELECT "team","outgoing head coach","date of vacancy","incoming head coach","date of appointment" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "incoming head coach" ILIKE '%Azenha%';
Result:
- team: portimonense | outgoing head coach: litos | date of vacancy: 28 december 2011 | incoming head coach: carlos azenha | date of appointment: 29 december 2010

2) Compare the vacancy date to 2011-12-28 (parsing the text date):
SQL:
SELECT team,
       "date of vacancy",
       to_date("date of vacancy", 'DD Month YYYY') AS vacancy_date,
       CASE
         WHEN to_date("date of vacancy", 'DD Month YYYY') > DATE '2011-12-28' THEN 'after'
         WHEN to_date("date of vacancy", 'DD Month YYYY') = DATE '2011-12-28' THEN 'on'
         ELSE 'before'
       END AS comparison,
       "incoming head coach"
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "incoming head coach" ILIKE '%Azenha%';
Result:
- team: portimonense | date of vacancy: 28 december 2011 | vacancy_date: 2011-12-28 | comparison: on | incoming head coach: carlos azenha

Findings:
- The only row with incoming head coach Carlos Azenha has a vacancy date equal to 28 December 2011, not after it.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the vacancy date is after 28 December 2011 (for the entry with incoming head coach Carlos Azenha) is not supported by the data. The incoming head coach identity is correct, but the “after” condition fails.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the user’s statement as a verification that, for records where the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha, the date of vacancy should be later than 2011-12-28. Dates were parsed using the format 'DD Month YYYY'.
