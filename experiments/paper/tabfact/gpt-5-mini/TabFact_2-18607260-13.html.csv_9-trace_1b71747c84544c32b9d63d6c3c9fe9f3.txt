Claim to verify: “the game on June 18 and 28, both have a score of 2 - 0.”

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1998_in_paraguayan_football (columns: date [text], venue [text], score [text], comp [text], report [text])

Step 1 — Inspect formats (date, score)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football LIMIT 10;
Key observations from returned rows:
- Dates are stored as text in the format "YYYY - MM - DD" (e.g., 1998 - 06 - 01).
- Scores are stored as text in the format "N - N" (e.g., 1 - 0). Some rows can include additional info like “( 1 - 0 aet )”.

Step 2 — List all matches in June 1998 and their scores
Executed SQL (discovery of date values):
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football ORDER BY date LIMIT 200;
Executed SQL (June 1998 matches):
SELECT date, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '1998 - 06 - %' ORDER BY to_date(replace(date,' ',''), 'YYYY-MM-DD');
Returned rows:
- 1998 - 06 - 01 | 5 - 1
- 1998 - 06 - 03 | 3 - 2
- 1998 - 06 - 06 | 1 - 0
- 1998 - 06 - 12 | 0 - 0
- 1998 - 06 - 19 | 0 - 0
- 1998 - 06 - 24 | 1 - 3
- 1998 - 06 - 28 | 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )

Step 3 — Check for a match on June 18, 1998
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '%1998 - 06 - 18%';
Result: 0 rows returned (no match on 1998 - 06 - 18).

Executed SQL (format variants just in case):
SELECT date, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date ILIKE '%1998 - 06 - 18%' OR date ILIKE '%1998-06-18%' OR date ILIKE '%1998%06%18%';
Result: 0 rows returned (no match on June 18, 1998, across common text patterns).

Step 4 — Check the June 28, 1998 score
From Step 2, the June 28 entry is: 1998 - 06 - 28 | 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet ) — not “2 - 0”.

Conclusion
- There is no game on June 18, 1998 in this dataset.
- The June 28, 1998 game’s regular-time score is 0 - 0 (decided 1 - 0 after extra time), not 2 - 0.
Therefore, the claim that “the game on June 18 and 28 both have a score of 2 - 0” is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the June 28 record.

Assumptions
- The relevant data source for “the game on June 18 and 28” is the only available table: t_1998_in_paraguayan_football.
- “Score of 2 - 0” is interpreted as the final score in regulation time; direction (home/away) is ignored because the claim does not specify teams.
- Dates are interpreted as calendar dates in 1998, consistent with the table’s scope and date formatting.
