Claim to verify: “the record for the 400 m event before Sep 4, 2009 be over 48.83.”

Data source explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact5 (public schema)
- Relevant table: memorial_van_damme
  - Columns: event (text), record (text), athlete (text), nationality (text), date (text)
  - Note: This table stores meet record information for the Memorial Van Damme (Brussels) meet; dates are stored as text.

What the data shows
1) All rows that mention 400 m (including hurdles) and their dates
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event ~* '400\s*-?\s*m' OR event ILIKE '%400m%';
- Result rows:
  - {event: "400 m", record: "48.83", athlete: "sanya richards", nationality: "united states", date: "4 september 2009"}
  - {event: "400 m hurdles", record: "53.43", athlete: "nezha bidouane", nationality: "morocco", date: "28 august 1998"}

2) Specifically for the 400 m (flat) event, list available rows and dates
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT event, record, athlete, date
  FROM public.memorial_van_damme
  WHERE event = '400 m'
  ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  - {event: "400 m", record: "48.83", athlete: "sanya richards", date: "4 september 2009"}

3) Check for any 400 m rows strictly before 4 September 2009
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.memorial_van_damme
  WHERE event = '400 m'
    AND to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') < to_date('4 september 2009','FMDD FMMonth YYYY');
- Result:
  - {cnt: 0}

Assessment
- The dataset contains a single 400 m record entry dated 4 September 2009 with a time of 48.83 (Sanya Richards). There are no entries for the 400 m event before that date in this table. Therefore, the claim that “the record for the 400 m event before Sep 4, 2009 be over 48.83” is not supported by the available data.
- Additionally, on the date 4 September 2009 itself, the record is exactly 48.83, which is not “over 48.83.”

Conclusion
- The claim is unsupported by the evidence in the accessible data and thus cannot be verified.

Assumptions
- “Record for the 400 m event” is interpreted within the scope of the Memorial Van Damme meet records stored in the memorial_van_damme table.
- “Before Sep 4, 2009” is interpreted strictly as dates earlier than 2009-09-04 (exclusive), using the table’s date text parsed with the format 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'.
