Claim to verify: "this person's lowest yearly earnings between 1998 and 2005 be 0."

Data sources explored:
- TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema)
- Relevant table discovered: public.casey_martin (columns include year and earnings)

Evidence collected
1) Year-by-year earnings in the 1998–2005 range
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, earnings FROM public.casey_martin WHERE year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result:
  1998: 37221
  2000: 143248
  2001: 0
  2002: 0
  2003: 0
  2004: 15858
  2005: 10547
  (Note: 1999 has no row in the table; to make this explicit, I also executed a series join.)

- Executed SQL (to show missing 1999 explicitly):
  SELECT y.year, cm.earnings
  FROM generate_series(1998,2005) AS y(year)
  LEFT JOIN public.casey_martin cm USING (year)
  ORDER BY y.year;
- Result excerpt:
  1998: 37221; 1999: NULL; 2000: 143248; 2001: 0; 2002: 0; 2003: 0; 2004: 15858; 2005: 10547

2) Minimum (non-null) earnings between 1998 and 2005
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(earnings) AS min_earnings FROM casey_martin WHERE year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 AND earnings IS NOT NULL;
- Result:
  min_earnings = 0

3) Years where the minimum occurs
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, earnings FROM casey_martin WHERE year BETWEEN 1998 AND 2005 AND earnings = 0 ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  2001: 0; 2002: 0; 2003: 0

Conclusion
- The data show that the minimum recorded yearly earnings for the person (Casey Martin) between 1998 and 2005 is 0, occurring in 2001, 2002, and 2003. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Notes
- 1999 has no row (earnings NULL), which is treated as missing data rather than 0 and thus does not affect the minimum among recorded earnings.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted "this person" as Casey Martin because the only available dataset in the environment is the table public.casey_martin.
- Interpreted "between 1998 and 2005" as inclusive of both endpoints.
- Treated NULL earnings as missing (excluded from the minimum calculation), while 0 is a valid recorded value.
