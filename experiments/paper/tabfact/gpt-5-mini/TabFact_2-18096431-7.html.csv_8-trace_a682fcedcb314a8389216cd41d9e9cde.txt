Claim interpreted: “Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe.”

Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema) with table t_1996_pga_championship containing player, country, and performance details for the 1996 PGA Championship.

Evidence from data
1) Country for Frank Nobilo
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Nobilo%';
- Result:
  player: frank nobilo | country: new zealand

2) Players from Zimbabwe in the event
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%zimbab%' ORDER BY player;
- Result:
  player: nick price | country: zimbabwe

3) Count of Zimbabwe players and New Zealand listing
- Executed SQL (count Zimbabwe):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS zimbabwe_count FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE LOWER(country) = 'zimbabwe';
- Result:
  zimbabwe_count: 1

- Executed SQL (list New Zealand):
  SELECT player, place, country, score, "to par", money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE LOWER(country) = 'new zealand' ORDER BY player;
- Result:
  player: frank nobilo | place: t8 | country: new zealand | score: 69 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 280 | to par: - 8 | money: 57500

Assessment
- In the 1996 PGA Championship dataset, Frank Nobilo is listed as from New Zealand, not Zimbabwe.
- The only player listed from Zimbabwe in this event is Nick Price.
- Therefore, the claim that “Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Because the available authoritative dataset pertains to the 1996 PGA Championship, the claim was evaluated against this event’s player list. Name and country matching was done case-insensitively.
