Summary
- Claim: "club belenenses, benfica and sport cp have lisbon as the city."
- Data source explored: PostgreSQL (TabFact) database. Public schema contains a table t_2004_05_primeira_liga with columns: club (text), head coach (text), city (text), stadium (text), and "2003 - 2004 season" (text). This table lists Portuguese Primeira Liga clubs and their cities.

Evidence
Executed SQL:
SELECT club, city FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga
WHERE club ILIKE '%Belenenses%' OR club ILIKE '%Benfica%' OR club ILIKE 'Sporting%'
ORDER BY club;

Results:
- club: belenenses — city: lisbon
- club: benfica — city: lisbon
- club: sporting cp — city: lisbon

Conclusion
- All three clubs—Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP—are listed with city = "lisbon" in the authoritative table. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "sport cp" as "Sporting CP."
- The verification is grounded in the 2004–05 Primeira Liga table, which includes canonical club-city associations. Matching used case-insensitive patterns to account for naming variations.
