Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available tournament data. While Annika Sörenstam (2003) and Catriona Matthew (2009) both won the Women’s British Open, neither did so with the lowest total strokes recorded in the event’s history in this dataset. The lowest 72-hole aggregate (score) belongs to Karen Stupples in 2004.

Evidence from data (Women’s British Open table)

1) Retrieve rows for Annika Sörenstam and Catriona Matthew (year, champion, score, to par, venue)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, champion, score, "to par", venue
FROM public.women_s_british_open
WHERE champion ILIKE '%soren%' OR champion ILIKE '%sörenstam%' OR champion ILIKE '%catriona%'
ORDER BY year;

Result rows:
- year: 2003, champion: annika sörenstam, score: 278, to par: - 10, venue: royal lytham & st annes golf club
- year: 2009, champion: catriona matthew, score: 285, to par: - 3, venue: royal lytham & st annes golf club

2) Find the overall minimum total strokes (score) across all years
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score FROM public.women_s_british_open;

Result:
- min_score: 269

3) List the champion(s) who achieved that minimum score
SQL executed:
SELECT year, champion, score, "to par", venue
FROM public.women_s_british_open
WHERE score = (SELECT MIN(score) FROM public.women_s_british_open)
ORDER BY year;

Result rows:
- year: 2004, champion: karen stupples, score: 269, to par: - 19, venue: sunningdale golf club

Interpretation
- Annika Sörenstam won with a score of 278 (not the lowest on record in this dataset).
- Catriona Matthew won with a score of 285 (not the lowest on record in this dataset).
- The lowest total strokes in the dataset is 269 by Karen Stupples (2004).

Therefore, the assertion that “annika sörenstam and catriona matthew win with the lowest number of stroke” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope: Interpreted the claim within the Women’s British Open, which is the available and authoritative dataset found.
- Meaning of “lowest number of stroke”: Interpreted as the lowest 72-hole aggregate score (“score” column) across tournament history in this table.
- Name matching: Used case-insensitive matching and allowed for diacritic/non-diacritic variants of Sörenstam.
