Summary
- Claim: “pentium dual - core t2410 with sspec number sla4j (m0) have socket p and release date q2 2008.”
- Finding: The database shows Pentium Dual-Core T2410 with S-Spec SLA4G (M0), Socket P, and release date Q3 2008. No entry found with S-Spec SLA4J.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact5 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors

Schema overview (relevant columns)
- Columns: "model number" (text), "sspec number" (text), "socket" (text), "release date" (text) …

Evidence
1) Search for model T2410 and S-Spec SLA4J (no results)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "socket", "release date"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE lower("model number") LIKE '%t2410%'
  AND lower("sspec number") = 'sla4j';

2) Search by S-Spec SLA4J alone (no results)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "socket", "release date"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE lower("sspec number") = 'sla4j'
LIMIT 20;

3) Search all rows mentioning T2410 (found one matching row)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "socket", "release date"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "model number" ILIKE '%T2410%';

Result row:
- model number: "pentium dual - core t2410"
- sspec number: "sla4 g (m0)"  [interpreted as SLA4G (M0)]
- socket: "socket p"
- release date: "q3 2008"

Assessment of each part of the claim
- Model: Pentium Dual-Core T2410 — Present in data. Supported.
- S-Spec: “SLA4J (M0)” — Not found; the T2410 entry shows “SLA4G (M0)”. Contradicted by data.
- Socket: “socket p” — Matches the T2410 entry. Supported.
- Release date: “Q2 2008” — Data shows “Q3 2008”. Contradicted by data.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes accurate and inaccurate elements. Socket P is correct for the T2410, but the S-Spec and release date do not match the data (SLA4G (M0), Q3 2008).

Assumptions
- Treated text matches case-insensitively. Interpreted “sla4 g (m0)” as “SLA4G (M0)”. Interpreted “Q2 2008”/“Q3 2008” as the values appearing in the “release date” column of the table.
