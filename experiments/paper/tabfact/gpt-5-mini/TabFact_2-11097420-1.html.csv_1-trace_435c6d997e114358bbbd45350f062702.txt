Claim interpreted: Two items were proposed but were never listed and never completed.

Data source explored
- Available dataset: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (Superfund sites in Mississippi) with columns including: cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted.

Sanity checks on value formats
- Executed SQL to see distinct values for the relevant columns and confirm how “listed” and “construction completed” represent missing/unset states.

SQL 1: Distinct values in proposed
SELECT DISTINCT "proposed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi ORDER BY "proposed";
Result values:
- 03 / 08 / 2004
- 05 / 10 / 1993
- 05 / 11 / 2000
- 06 / 14 / 2001
- 06 / 23 / 1993
- 09 / 08 / 1983
- 09 / 27 / 2006
- 10 / 15 / 1984
- cleanup completed before formal creation of npl

SQL 2: Distinct values in listed
SELECT DISTINCT "listed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi ORDER BY "listed";
Result values:
- -
- 03 / 07 / 2007
- 06 / 10 / 1986
- 07 / 22 / 2004
- 07 / 27 / 2000
- 09 / 13 / 2001
- 09 / 21 / 1984
- cleanup completed before formal creation of npl

SQL 3: Distinct values in construction completed
SELECT DISTINCT "construction completed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi ORDER BY "construction completed";
Result values:
- -
- 08 / 08 / 1997
- 09 / 17 / 1993
- 12 / 30 / 1982

SQL 4: Total rows
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi;
Result: 9

Verification of the claim
- We interpret “proposed” as rows where proposed is a date (not the text 'cleanup completed before formal creation of npl').
- “Never listed” is interpreted as listed = '-'.
- “Never completed” is interpreted as construction completed = '-'.

SQL 5: Retrieve matching rows
SELECT name, "cerclis id", proposed, listed, "construction completed"
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed IS NOT NULL
  AND proposed <> 'cleanup completed before formal creation of npl'
  AND listed = '-'
  AND "construction completed" = '-';
Rows returned:
- name: chemfax , inc; cerclis id: msd008154486; proposed: 06 / 23 / 1993; listed: -; construction completed: -
- name: potter co; cerclis id: msd056029648; proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993; listed: -; construction completed: -

SQL 6: Count of such rows
SELECT count(*)
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed IS NOT NULL
  AND proposed <> 'cleanup completed before formal creation of npl'
  AND listed = '-'
  AND "construction completed" = '-';
Result: 2

Conclusion
- The data show exactly two sites with a proposed date that have never been listed and have no construction completed date. This supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- “Project” refers to Superfund sites in the provided dataset.
- A hyphen ('-') in listed or construction completed indicates “never listed”/“not completed.”
- “Proposed” is satisfied by having a concrete proposed date (excluding the special text 'cleanup completed before formal creation of npl').
