Assessment of the claim
- “Galina Voskoboeva never play(ed) the same opponent more than 1 time”: Supported by this dataset. Each listed opponent appears exactly once.
- “...except in 6 june 2006”: Contradicted by the data. On 6 june 2006 there is only one match recorded, against Alice Canepa, and she does not appear elsewhere in the table.

Conclusion
- The core ‘no repeated opponents’ pattern holds within this table, but the stated exception on 6 june 2006 is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Each row represents a distinct match involving Galina Voskoboeva.
- The date values are stored as text; comparisons used the exact text “6 june 2006.”
- Conclusions are strictly based on the available table public.galina_voskoboeva, treated as authoritative within its scope.
