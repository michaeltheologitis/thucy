Claim interpreted: The user asserts that, among episodes with an original airdate of 8 June 2008, the least-watched episode number is 4.

Data source discovery and structure:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), original airdate (text), timeslot (approx) (text), viewers (millions) (double precision), nightly rank (bigint)

Method:
1) Identify all rows whose original airdate corresponds to 8 June 2008 using case-insensitive matching across common textual formats.
2) Compute the minimum viewers (millions) among those rows and return the episode(s) with that minimum.

Evidence and executed SQL:
A) Retrieve rows matching 8 June 2008 (broad regex match)
SQL:
SELECT episode, "original airdate", "viewers (millions)", "nightly rank"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original airdate" ~* '(^|[^[:alnum:]])(8|08)[[:space:]]+(June|Jun)[[:space:]]+2008([^[:alnum:]]|$)'
   OR "original airdate" ~* '(^|[^[:alnum:]])(June|Jun)[[:space:]]+(8|08),?[[:space:]]+2008([^[:alnum:]]|$)';
Result:
- episode: 4; original airdate: 8 june 2008; viewers (millions): 1.364; nightly rank: 4

B) Targeted 3-step verification (strict regex for 8 June 2008)
1) List matching rows
SQL:
SELECT episode, "original airdate", "viewers (millions)" 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original airdate" ~* '^\s*(?:0?8\s+June|June\s+0?8,?)\s+2008\s*$';
Result:
[ { episode: 4, original airdate: '8 june 2008', viewers (millions): 1.364 } ]

2) Compute minimum viewers among those rows
SQL:
SELECT MIN("viewers (millions)") AS min_viewers
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original airdate" ~* '^\s*(?:0?8\s+June|June\s+0?8,?)\s+2008\s*$';
Result:
[ { min_viewers: 1.364 } ]

3) Return episode(s) whose viewers equal that minimum
SQL:
SELECT episode, "original airdate", "viewers (millions)"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original airdate" ~* '^\s*(?:0?8\s+June|June\s+0?8,?)\s+2008\s*$'
  AND "viewers (millions)" = (
    SELECT MIN("viewers (millions)")
    FROM public.my_info_table
    WHERE "original airdate" ~* '^\s*(?:0?8\s+June|June\s+0?8,?)\s+2008\s*$'
  );
Result:
[ { episode: 4, original airdate: '8 june 2008', viewers (millions): 1.364 } ]

Conclusion:
- The data show a single episode on 8 June 2008: episode 4 with 1.364 million viewers. Consequently, the least-watched episode number on that date is 4. This supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions:
- The date field is textual; matching used case-insensitive regex to capture common forms of 8 June 2008 (e.g., '8 June 2008', 'June 8, 2008').
- The claim pertains to the episodes contained in public.my_info_table (no show specified).
