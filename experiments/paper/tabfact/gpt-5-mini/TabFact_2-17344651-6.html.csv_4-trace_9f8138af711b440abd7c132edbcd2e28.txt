Claim to verify: “the chicago bull only play the boston celtic at the boston garden during the 1984 - 85 season.”

Summary of findings
- The available data source contains a single table of Boston Celtics game logs labeled “t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season,” but it only covers a subset of the season (14 games in January 1985). Within this subset, the only Celtics–Bulls game took place at Boston Garden. However, because the dataset is incomplete for the full season, the claim cannot be verified for the entire 1984–85 season.

Data source discovery
- Tool: data source discovery
- Result: Found PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season. No Chicago Bulls table or other season-wide tables were discoverable.

Schema inspection
- Table: t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), score (text), location (text), record (text)

Step 1: Check table coverage (how much of the season is included?)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: total_games = 14

- SQL executed (lexicographic min/max on text dates):
  SELECT MIN(date) AS min_date, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: min_date = "fri jan 11", max_date = "wed jan 9" (lexicographic only)

- SQL executed (inspect all distinct date strings):
  SELECT date, COUNT(*) as cnt FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
- Result: All entries are January dates (e.g., wed jan 2 through wed jan 30), 14 total rows.

- SQL executed (chronological min/max by parsing day and assigning Jan 1985):
  SELECT MIN(to_date(split_part(date,' ',3) || ' jan 1985', 'DD Mon YYYY')) AS min_date,
         MAX(to_date(split_part(date,' ',3) || ' jan 1985', 'DD Mon YYYY')) AS max_date
  FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: min_date = 1985-01-02, max_date = 1985-01-30

Interpretation: The table contains a slice of the 1984–85 season (January 1985 only), not the full season.

Step 2: Identify Celtics vs. Bulls games in the table and where they were played
- SQL executed (count Celtics–Bulls rows):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Chicago Bulls%';
- Result: cnt = 1

- SQL executed (list game details):
  SELECT date, location, opponent FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Chicago Bulls%' ORDER BY date;
- Result: date = "wed jan 9", location = "boston garden", opponent = "chicago bulls"

Step 3: Confirm that “location” is a venue name and check for any Chicago venues
- SQL executed (distinct locations with counts):
  SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS games, MIN(opponent) AS example_opponent
  FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  GROUP BY location
  ORDER BY games DESC;
- Result (samples): boston garden (8), madison square garden (1), the spectrum (1), the omni (1), market square arena (1), brendan byrne arena (1), hartford civic center (1). These are arena names, indicating "location" is indeed the venue.

- SQL executed (any games with location containing "chicago"):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE location ILIKE '%chicago%';
- Result: cnt = 0

Conclusion
- Within the available January 1985 subset, the only Celtics–Bulls game was played at Boston Garden. However, the dataset does not cover the entire 1984–85 season, so the claim that the Bulls “only” played the Celtics at Boston Garden for the whole season cannot be established from the evidence. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the accessible data for the full-season scope.

Assumptions and limitations
- The only accessible table for this topic covers January 1985 (14 games) and not the full season. No additional season-complete tables were available in the connected data sources. The verdict reflects this limitation.
