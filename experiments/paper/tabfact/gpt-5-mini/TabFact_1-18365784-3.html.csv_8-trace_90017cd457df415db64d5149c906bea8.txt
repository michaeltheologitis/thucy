Claim interpreted: There is a train to Mablethorpe that calls at Willoughby, Alford, Louth, Waltham, and Spilsby, with a departure time of 19.15 on Friday.

Findings grounded in the data:
1) Trains to Mablethorpe (all results) — shows actual calling pattern and the 19.15 (fri) service exists, but does not include the listed extra stops:
SQL executed:
SELECT departure, "going to", "calling at", arrival, operator FROM my_info_table WHERE lower("going to") = lower('Mablethorpe');
Results:
- 11.02 | mablethorpe | willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe | 11.32 | gnr
- 11.49 | mablethorpe | willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe | 12.2  | gnr
- 19.15 (fri) | mablethorpe | willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe | 19.5 | gnr

2) Verify the specific 19.15 (fri) Mablethorpe service and its stops — confirms the calling points do not match the claim:
SQL executed:
SELECT departure, "calling at" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE departure ILIKE '%19.15%' AND "going to" ILIKE 'Mablethorpe';
Result:
- 19.15 (fri) | willoughby , mumby road , sutton - on - sea , mablethorpe

3) Check if any Mablethorpe-bound train includes any of Alford, Louth, Waltham, or Spilsby — none found:
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("going to") = 'mablethorpe' AND (lower("calling at") LIKE '%alford%' OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%louth%' OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%waltham%' OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%spilsby%');
Result:
- count = 0

4) Check if any 19.15 departure that calls at Willoughby also includes any of the additional stations — none found:
SQL executed:
SELECT departure, "going to", "calling at"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower(departure) LIKE '%19.15%'
  AND lower("calling at") LIKE '%willoughby%'
  AND (
    lower("calling at") LIKE '%alford%'
    OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%louth%'
    OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%waltham%'
    OR lower("calling at") LIKE '%spilsby%'
  );
Result: 0 rows

Conclusion:
- True parts: A train to Mablethorpe departs at 19.15 (Fri) and calls at Willoughby.
- False parts: That 19.15 (Fri) Mablethorpe service does not call at Alford, Louth, Waltham, or Spilsby (and no Mablethorpe service in the data includes those stops).

Assumptions made:
- Matching was done case-insensitively (using lower(...) or ILIKE), and station names were searched as substrings within the "calling at" text field.
- The claim refers to a single service whose calling pattern includes all the listed stops and departs at the specified time.
- The provided database (TabFact, public.my_info_table) is authoritative for this verification task.
