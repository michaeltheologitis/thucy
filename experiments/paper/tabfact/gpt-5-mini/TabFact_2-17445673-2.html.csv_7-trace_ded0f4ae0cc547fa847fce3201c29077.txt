Overview
- Claim interpreted: “More than 2 matches were played through 3 rounds.”
- Dataset explored: TabFact → public schema → table: tim_lajcik (fight records for Tim Lajcik).

Data source discovery
- Tool used: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table public.tim_lajcik.

Schema inspection
- Tool used: schema_query
- Table public.tim_lajcik columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text).

Raw evidence (full table retrieval)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.tim_lajcik;
- Result highlights relevant to “3 rounds”:
  • Row 3: round = 3 (win, decision – unanimous, 5:00)
  • Row 9: round = 3 (draw, 5:00)
  • All other fights end in rounds 1 or 2.

Targeted verification queries and results
1) How many fights have round = 3?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count_round_eq_3 FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE round = 3;
- Result: count_round_eq_3 = 2

2) How many fights have round >= 3 (i.e., reached the third round)?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count_round_ge_3 FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE round >= 3;
- Result: count_round_ge_3 = 2

3) Are there any fights beyond 3 rounds?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count_round_gt_3 FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE round > 3;
- Result: count_round_gt_3 = 0

Conclusion
- Only 2 fights reached/ended in round 3. Therefore, the statement “more than 2 match be play through 3 round” is not supported by the data in public.tim_lajcik.

Assumptions
- Scope: The claim refers to the fights listed in the public.tim_lajcik table.
- “Through 3 round” is interpreted as fights that reached the third round (round >= 3) or ended in round 3. Both interpretations yield a count of 2, which is not more than 2.
