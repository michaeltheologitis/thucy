Data source discovery
- Available source: postgres_tabfact29 (public schema). Identified table relevant to TV episodes: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes.

- Table: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
  - Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text)

Evidence 1: Which White Collar episode(s) were directed by Robert Duncan McNeill, and what are their production codes?
- Result:
  - title: parting shots; no in season: 4; no in series: 50; production code: bcw404; is_BCW403: false
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "title", "no in season", "no in series", "production code", ("production code" = 'BCW403') AS is_BCW403
  FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
  WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Robert Duncan McNeill%';

Evidence 2: Which episode has production code BCW403, and who directed it?
- Result:
  - title: diminishing returns; no in season: 3; no in series: 49; directed by: stefan schwartz; production code: BCW403

The production code BCW403 corresponds to “diminishing returns,” directed by Stefan Schwartz.
