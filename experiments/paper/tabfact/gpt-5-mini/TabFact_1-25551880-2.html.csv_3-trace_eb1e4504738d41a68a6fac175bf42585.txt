Claim to verify: “mickaël delage be the only person to appear in the mountain classification just 1 time.”

Data sources discovered
- Single relational source: TabFact -> public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a (interpreted as the 2010 Vuelta a España stages and classification holders).

Schema (relevant parts)
- Columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), general classification (text), points classification (text), mountains classification (text), combination classification (text), team classification (text).

Evidence gathered from SQL queries
1) Count total rows (stages)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a;
- Result: 21 rows
- Interpretation: 21 stages are represented, so there are 21 “mountains classification” entries total.

2) List each value in mountains classification and how many times it appears
- SQL:
  SELECT "mountains classification" AS rider, COUNT(*) AS appearances
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  WHERE "mountains classification" IS NOT NULL AND "mountains classification" <> ''
  GROUP BY "mountains classification"
  ORDER BY appearances DESC, rider ASC;
- Result:
  - david moncoutié — 13
  - serafín martínez — 6
  - mickaël delage — 1
  - not awarded — 1
- Interpretation: Two values appear exactly once: “mickaël delage” and the placeholder “not awarded”.

3) Directly identify which values appear exactly once
- SQL:
  SELECT "mountains classification", COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  GROUP BY "mountains classification"
  ORDER BY cnt ASC, "mountains classification" ASC;
- Result rows:
  - {"mountains classification":"mickaël delage", "cnt":1}
  - {"mountains classification":"not awarded", "cnt":1}
  - {"mountains classification":"serafín martínez", "cnt":6}
  - {"mountains classification":"david moncoutié", "cnt":13}

4) Count how many single-occurrence values are rider names (excluding literal 'not awarded') and list them
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS single_named_count
  FROM (
    SELECT "mountains classification"
    FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
    GROUP BY "mountains classification"
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 AND "mountains classification" <> 'not awarded'
  ) AS t;
- Result: 1
- SQL (list):
  SELECT "mountains classification" AS name
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  GROUP BY "mountains classification"
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 1 AND "mountains classification" <> 'not awarded'
  ORDER BY name;
- Result:
  - mickaël delage

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (2010 Vuelta a España stages), the only person who appears exactly once in the mountains classification column is mickaël delage. The other single-occurrence value is the non-person placeholder “not awarded.” Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope: Limited to the 2010 Vuelta a España table available in the data environment.
- “Person” excludes the literal placeholder “not awarded.”
- Values were treated exactly as stored (no case or accent normalization); NULLs/empty strings were excluded where noted.
