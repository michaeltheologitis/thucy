Claim interpreted: “It be 1998 when the role/episode be David Duchovny.” I interpret this as asserting that the X-Files awards table has an entry with year = 1998 for which the value in the column “role / episode” is David Duchovny.

Data source inspected: TabFact (postgres_tabfact20) → public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
Columns: year, category, recipients and nominees, role / episode, result

Evidence
1) Distinct years for rows where role / episode contains “David Duchovny”
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "year"
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
WHERE lower("role / episode") LIKE '%david duchovny%'
ORDER BY "year" ASC;
Result:
1997

2) Full rows where role / episode contains “David Duchovny”
SQL:
SELECT year, category, "recipients and nominees", "role / episode", result
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
WHERE "role / episode" ILIKE '%David Duchovny%'
ORDER BY year ASC, category ASC;
Result (1 row):
- year: 1997
  category: best actor in a leading role - drama series
  recipients and nominees: david duchovny
  role / episode: david duchovny
  result: nominated

3) Direct check for any 1998 row with role / episode containing “David Duchovny”
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files WHERE year = 1998 AND "role / episode" ILIKE '%David Duchovny%';
Result: count = 0

SQL:
SELECT year, category, "recipients and nominees", "role / episode", result FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files WHERE year = 1998 AND "role / episode" ILIKE '%David Duchovny%';
Result: no rows returned

Conclusion
- The only entry with role / episode = David Duchovny occurs in 1997, not 1998.
- There are zero entries in 1998 where the role / episode contains David Duchovny.
Therefore, the claim that “it be 1998 when the role / episode be David Duchovny” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “role/episode be David Duchovny” was interpreted as the column “role / episode” containing the text “David Duchovny” (case-insensitive).
