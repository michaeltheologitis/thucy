Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to ground the verification.
- Queried the competition results table to find whether an entry exists where Anders Martinson (USA) is second and Jean-François Bouvery (France) is fourth.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table available: public.cleveland_international_piano_competition with columns: year (bigint), first (text), second (text), third (text), fourth (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Initial search for candidates with “Anders” in second place
SQL executed:
SELECT year, second, fourth FROM public.cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE second ILIKE '%Anders%';
Result:
[{"year":1991, "second":"anders martinson usa", "fourth":"jean - françois bouvery france"}]

2) Verify both names and countries and return the exact strings
SQL executed:
SELECT year, second, fourth, (second ILIKE '%USA%') AS second_has_USA, (fourth ILIKE '%France%') AS fourth_has_France
FROM public.cleveland_international_piano_competition
WHERE second ILIKE '%martinson%'
  AND fourth ILIKE '%bouvery%';
Result:
[{"year":1991, "second":"anders martinson usa", "fourth":"jean - françois bouvery france", "second_has_usa":true, "fourth_has_france":true}]

Findings
- A row exists for year 1991 in which:
  - Second place: "anders martinson usa"
  - Fourth place: "jean - françois bouvery france"
- Both “USA” and “France” appear alongside the respective names, satisfying the country conditions.

Conclusion
- The claim that “jean - françois bouvery france be fourth when anders martinson usa be second” is fully supported by the data (year 1991).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement as referring to placements in the same event/year within the available competition results table.
- Matching performed case-insensitively and by substrings to handle minor formatting and diacritic variations.
