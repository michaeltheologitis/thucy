Claim interpreted: “Stage 1 is the only stage where a mountains classification wasn’t awarded.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact). Within it, a relevant table exists: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a, which includes per-stage information and a “mountains classification” column.

Relevant schema (via schema inspection)
- Table: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  - Columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), general classification (text), points classification (text), mountains classification (text), combination classification (text), team classification (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) List all stages and their mountains classification values
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, "mountains classification" FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a ORDER BY stage;
Result (stage → mountains classification):
1 → not awarded
2 → mickaël delage
3 → serafín martínez
4 → serafín martínez
5 → serafín martínez
6 → serafín martínez
7 → serafín martínez
8 → serafín martínez
9 → david moncoutié
10 → david moncoutié
11 → david moncoutié
12 → david moncoutié
13 → david moncoutié
14 → david moncoutié
15 → david moncoutié
16 → david moncoutié
17 → david moncoutié
18 → david moncoutié
19 → david moncoutié
20 → david moncoutié
21 → david moncoutié
Interpretation: Only stage 1 shows “not awarded”; all other stages list a rider.

2) Count stages marked explicitly as “not awarded”
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS not_awarded_count FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE "mountains classification" = 'not awarded';
Result: not_awarded_count = 1

3) Identify which stage(s) are “not awarded”
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, "mountains classification" FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE "mountains classification" = 'not awarded' ORDER BY stage;
Result: stage = 1

4) Check for other missing values (NULL or empty string)
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, "mountains classification" FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE "mountains classification" IS NULL OR trim("mountains classification") = '' ORDER BY stage;
Result: no rows returned (i.e., no other missing values)

Conclusion
- The data shows that Stage 1 is the only stage where the mountains classification was “not awarded.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- Context: The claim is interpreted as referring to the 2010 Vuelta a España, because this is the cycling race table available in the accessible TabFact database.
- “Wasn’t award” is interpreted as “wasn’t awarded,” matching the literal value “not awarded” present in the data.
