Claim to verify: “Aldershot Town were the opponent on 10 March 2009, when Bradford City scored their highest point total.”

What the data shows
- The 2008–09 Bradford City A.F.C. season table lists match dates, opponents, venues, results, and attendance.
- Bradford City’s highest-scoring match (most goals scored by Bradford in a single game) in this dataset was 5 goals, achieved on 7 March 2009 vs Aldershot Town (result 5 - 0).
- On 10 March 2009, Bradford City played Rochdale away and lost 0 - 3.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL
1) Full season context (to inspect dates, opponents, and result format)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season;
Key relevant rows returned include:
- game=35, date=7 march 2009, opponent=aldershot town, venue=home, result=5 - 0, attendance=12465
- game=36, date=10 march 2009, opponent=rochdale, venue=away, result=0 - 3, attendance=5157

2) Identify the match(es) with the maximum goals scored by Bradford (parse left-hand side of result as Bradford’s goals)
Executed SQL:
WITH gf AS (
  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, trim(split_part(result, '-', 1))::int AS goals_for
  FROM t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
)
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, goals_for
FROM gf
WHERE goals_for = (SELECT MAX(goals_for) FROM gf);
Result:
- date = 7 march 2009, opponent = aldershot town, venue = home, result = 5 - 0, goals_for = 5

3) Confirm opponent and result on 10 March 2009
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
WHERE lower(date) = '10 march 2009';
Result:
- game: 36, date: 10 march 2009, opponent: rochdale, venue: away, result: 0 - 3, attendance: 5157

Conclusion
- Aldershot Town were not the opponent on 10 March 2009; Rochdale were.
- Bradford City’s highest-scoring game (5 goals) in this dataset occurred on 7 March 2009 vs Aldershot Town, not on 10 March 2009.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “highest point total” as “most goals scored by Bradford City in a single match” because the available table records match results (goals) but does not store cumulative league points by date.
