Summary
Based on the available data for the Denver Nuggets 2009–10 season (games 3–16, November 1–27), the Nuggets played exactly six games at Pepsi Center during this span and won all six.

Data source and structure reviewed
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
- Note: The location attendance column contains the arena name followed by attendance (e.g., "pepsi center 19141"). The score column begins with "w" or "l" indicating a win or loss.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List of all games at Pepsi Center within the span (games 3–16)
Exact SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE game BETWEEN 3 AND 16
  AND lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%'
ORDER BY game;

Result (abbrev.):
- Game 3 | Nov 1 | vs Grizzlies | score: w 133 - 123 (ot) | location: pepsi center 15823
- Game 10 | Nov 13 | vs Lakers | score: w 105 - 79 (ot) | location: pepsi center 19141
- Game 11 | Nov 17 | vs Raptors | score: w 130 - 112 (ot) | location: pepsi center 16446
- Game 13 | Nov 21 | vs Bulls | score: w 112 - 93 (ot) | location: pepsi center 19359
- Game 14 | Nov 24 | vs Nets | score: w 101 - 87 (ot) | location: pepsi center 16307
- Game 16 | Nov 27 | vs Knicks | score: w 128 - 125 (ot) | location: pepsi center 19155

2) Count of Pepsi Center games in the span
Exact SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_pepsi_games
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE game BETWEEN 3 AND 16
  AND lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%';

Result: total_pepsi_games = 6

3) Count of wins at Pepsi Center in the span
Exact SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS pepsi_wins
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE game BETWEEN 3 AND 16
  AND lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%'
  AND score LIKE 'w %' ;

Result: pepsi_wins = 6

Conclusion
Within the available span (games 3–16, Nov 1–27, 2009), the Nuggets won all 6 games played at Pepsi Center.

Assumptions
- "This span" is interpreted as the range of games present in the accessible dataset (games 3–16), covering November 1–27 of the 2009–10 season.
- A game is identified as being at Pepsi Center if the location attendance field contains the substring "pepsi center" (case-insensitive).
- A win is identified when the score field begins with the character "w".
