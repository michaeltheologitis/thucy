Data source discovery
- Located a PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact16, schema: public) containing a table relevant to the claim: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia with columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text).

Evidence
1) What happened on 25 May, 1933 (stage result and race leader)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE date ILIKE '%25 may%';
- Result:
  date: 25 may
  course: udine to bassano del grappa
  winner: ettore meini ( ita )
  race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
- Interpretation: On 25 May, the stage was won by Ettore Meini, and Alfredo Binda was the overall race leader.

2) When did Gérard Loncke win around that time?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE lower(date) = '26 may';
- Result:
  date: 26 may
  course: bassano del grappa to bolzano
  winner: gerard loncke ( bel )
  race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
- Interpretation: Gérard Loncke won the following day, 26 May, with Alfredo Binda still the overall leader.

Conclusion
- The claim that “Gérard Loncke won the race on May 25” is contradicted by the data; the stage winner on May 25 was Ettore Meini. 
- The statement that Alfredo Binda was the race leader at that time is supported by the data.
- Overall, the claim mixes a correct detail (Binda as leader) with an incorrect one (Loncke winning on May 25); Loncke’s win occurred on May 26, not May 25.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win the race on May 25” to mean “won the stage on that date,” given the context mentioning the race leader on that day.
