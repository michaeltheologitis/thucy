Claim to verify: When the driver is Harry Schell, the entrant is Ecurie Bleue; and when the driver is Philippe Étancelin, the entrant is Private.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix with columns: driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, tyre.

Evidence gathered:
1) Check exact driver name spellings in the table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT driver FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix ORDER BY driver;
- Key results (excerpt):
  - harry schell
  - philippe étancelin

2) Retrieve entrant values for the two drivers (case-insensitive match to align with stored lowercase names)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE lower(driver) IN ('harry schell','philippe étancelin');
- Results:
  - harry schell — entrant: ecurie bleue
  - philippe étancelin — entrant: private

Conclusion:
- The data shows that for driver harry schell the entrant is ecurie bleue, and for driver philippe étancelin the entrant is private. This directly matches the claim.

Assumptions noted:
- The table t_1950_swiss_grand_prix represents entry data for the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix and is treated as authoritative per the provided data environment.
- Driver names in the table are stored in lowercase; I used a case-insensitive comparison (lower(driver)) to match the specified names.
- Accented characters (e.g., étancelin) are preserved and matched as stored in the database.
