Claim interpreted: The question appears to ask whether the player in second place is from South Africa, using the available leaderboard-style data.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact1 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text). This table functions as a leaderboard for the 1973 U.S. Open (golf).

Step 1: Inspect the possible place values to identify how second place is represented.
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;
Result:
- 1
- 2
- t3
- t6
Interpretation: Second place is represented by the value '2'.

Step 2: Retrieve the player and country for second place.
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = '2';
Result:
- player: jim colbert, country: united states

Conclusion: The player in second place is Jim Colbert from the United States, not South Africa.

Assumptions:
- Given only one accessible table related to leaderboards, I interpreted the question as referring to the 1973 U.S. Open golf leaderboard (public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf).
