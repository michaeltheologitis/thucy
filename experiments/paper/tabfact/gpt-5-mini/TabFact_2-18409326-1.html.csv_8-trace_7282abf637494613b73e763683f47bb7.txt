Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data source(s) and inspected the schema to locate relevant tables.
- I then queried the table containing media station information for Kelowna to find any entry for 1150 AM and checked its call sign and owner.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11)
- Schema: public
- Table: media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency text, "call sign" text, branding text, format text, owner text)

Evidence query and results
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
WHERE frequency ILIKE '%1150%';

Result:
- frequency: 1150 am
- call sign: ckfr
- branding: am 1150
- format: news / talk
- owner: astral media

Assessment of the claim components
- "AM 1150 radio": The table has a record with frequency "1150 am" and branding "am 1150". Supported.
- "owned by Astral Media": The owner field for this record is "astral media". Supported.
- "call sign ... CKFR": The call sign field is "ckfr" (lowercase in data, equivalent to CKFR). Supported.

Conclusion
- The data directly confirms that the AM 1150 station owned by Astral Media has the call sign CKFR.

Assumptions
- I treated case differences (ckfr vs. CKFR) as non-substantive.
- I matched records by searching for frequency values containing "1150" (case-insensitive) to capture entries stored as "1150 am".
