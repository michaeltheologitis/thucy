Claim to verify: "otto graham have win 44 more game than he lose"

Data sources discovered
- TabFact PostgreSQL, public schema
- Table: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks (columns: quarterback, uniform no (s), games started, wins, losses, ties, winning pct)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve Otto Graham’s wins, losses, ties, and compute wins − losses
SQL query executed:
SELECT quarterback, wins, losses, ties, (wins - losses) AS diff
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Otto%';

Result:
- quarterback: graham , otto
- wins: 57
- losses: 13
- ties: 1
- diff (wins - losses): 44

2) Confirm uniqueness of the Otto Graham row
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Graham%';
Returned row(s):
- quarterback: graham , otto; uniform no (s): 60 , 14; games started: 71; wins: 57; losses: 13; ties: 1; winning pct: 810

SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, COUNT(*) AS occurrences FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Graham%' GROUP BY quarterback ORDER BY occurrences DESC;
Returned row(s):
- quarterback: graham , otto — occurrences: 1

Interpretation
- The table shows Otto Graham with 57 wins and 13 losses. The computed difference is 57 − 13 = 44 more wins than losses, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted against the Browns starting quarterbacks table (regular-season starts for the Cleveland Browns as captured by this dataset). Otto Graham only played for the Browns, so this aligns with his Browns record.
- Name matching used case-insensitive search (ILIKE) to locate “graham , otto.”
