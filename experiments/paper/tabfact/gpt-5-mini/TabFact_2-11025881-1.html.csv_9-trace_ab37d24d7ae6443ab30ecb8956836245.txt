Claim assessed: “the gap between first and last be less than 50 point.”

Interpretation: Using the available dataset (postgres_tabfact33.public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships), interpret “first” as the lowest rank (1st place) and “last” as the highest rank (last place). Interpret “point” as the points column and “gap” as the difference (first_points − last_points).

Finding: The computed gap is 58.04 points, which is not less than 50.

Evidence from data (exact executed SQL and results):

1) Compute first-place, last-place, and points gap in one query
SQL:
SELECT f.rank AS first_rank, f.name AS first_name, f.points AS first_points, l.rank AS last_rank, l.name AS last_name, l.points AS last_points, ROUND((f.points - l.points)::numeric, 2) AS points_gap FROM (SELECT rank, name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships ORDER BY rank ASC LIMIT 1) f CROSS JOIN (SELECT rank, name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships ORDER BY rank DESC LIMIT 1) l;
Result:
[{"first_rank":1,"first_name":"mark cockerell","first_points":172.42,"last_rank":19,"last_name":"marc franquet","last_points":114.38,"points_gap":58.04}]

2) Cross-check: first-place row
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships ORDER BY rank ASC LIMIT 1;
Result:
[{"rank":1,"name":"mark cockerell","points":172.42}]

Conclusion based on evidence: 58.04 >= 50, so the claim that the gap is less than 50 points is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “First” = lowest rank; “last” = highest rank in the table.
- “Point” refers to the numeric ‘points’ column.
- The 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships table is the intended context given it is the available dataset in the environment.
