Conclusion: The aggregate score for two legs with results 4-1 and 4-1 is 8-2.

Data source exploration
- Discovered available data connectivity but no domain tables were needed for this arithmetic calculation. Computation performed via SQL over literal values.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Aggregate totals per team across both legs
SQL:
SELECT SUM(team_a) AS team_a_total, SUM(team_b) AS team_b_total
FROM (VALUES (4,1), (4,1)) AS v(team_a, team_b);
Result:
- team_a_total = 8
- team_b_total = 2

2) Aggregate totals plus goal difference (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT SUM(team_a) AS team_a_total, SUM(team_b) AS team_b_total, SUM(team_a)-SUM(team_b) AS goal_difference
FROM (VALUES (4,1), (4,1)) AS v(team_a, team_b);
Result:
- team_a_total = 8
- team_b_total = 2
- goal_difference = 6

Therefore, the aggregate scoreline is 8-2.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the request as a two-leg tie where the two match scores were 4-1 and 4-1.
- The first number in each pair is Team A’s goals and the second is Team B’s goals; away-goals rules or extra time do not affect the arithmetic aggregate.
