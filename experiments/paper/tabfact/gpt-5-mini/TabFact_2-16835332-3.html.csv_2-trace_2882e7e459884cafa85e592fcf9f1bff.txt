Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources and inspected the schema to locate a table containing player rebound statistics.
- I then queried the relevant table for the player named "herb estes" to verify the total rebounds value.

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”.
- Discovered table: public.my_info_table with relevant columns: player (text), years (text), games (bigint), "reb avg" (double), and "total rebounds" (bigint).

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds" 
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE lower(player) LIKE '%herb%'
     OR lower(player) LIKE '%estes%';

- Result row:
  - player: herb estes
  - years: 1973 - 1976
  - games: 80
  - reb avg: 9.2
  - total rebounds: 734

Conclusion
- The data shows that player "herb estes" has total rebounds = 734. This directly matches the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the “total rebounds” statistic as stored in public.my_info_table for the player name exactly matching “herb estes”.
