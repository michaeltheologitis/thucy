Interpretation: The user appears to be asking for the venue when Rangers F.C. played against Linfield in the available dataset.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact29 (TabFact), schema: public.
- Table available: public.t_2003_04_rangers_f_c_season with columns [date text, opponent text, venue text, result text, attendance bigint].

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
  FROM public.t_2003_04_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Linfield%';

- Result:
  • date: 30 july 2003 | opponent: linfield | venue: a | result: 3 - 0 | attendance: 13284

Conclusion:
- According to the dataset, the recorded venue for the match versus Linfield is “a” (commonly used to denote an away fixture). No other Linfield entries were found in this table.

Assumptions:
- The fragmentary request was interpreted as: “What is the venue for the match where Linfield were the opponent in the available Rangers 2003–04 season table?”
- The venue code “a” is treated as the literal value stored in the table; typical football datasets use H/A/N coding, where “a” generally indicates away.
