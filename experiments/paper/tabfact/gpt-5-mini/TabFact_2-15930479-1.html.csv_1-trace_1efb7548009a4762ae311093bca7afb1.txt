Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup (columns: date, event, winner, team, series leader)

Evidence collected:
1) Checked how October dates are formatted in the table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE date ILIKE '%october%' OR date ILIKE '%oct%';
Result:
[{"date":"october 9"},{"date":"october 5"}]

2) Retrieved the row for October 9 to verify the series leader.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, event, winner, team, "series leader" FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE lower(date) = 'october 9';
Result:
[{"date":"october 9","event":"paris - bourges","series leader":"jérôme pineau ( fra )","team":"team columbia","winner":"bernhard eisel ( aut )"}]

Conclusion:
- On October 9 (as recorded in the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup table), the series leader is listed as "jérôme pineau ( fra )". This directly supports the claim that on October 9 Jérôme Pineau was the series leader.

Assumptions:
- "Series leader" refers to the series leader of the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup.
- The date "October 9" refers to the entry in that season (2008) captured by the table.
