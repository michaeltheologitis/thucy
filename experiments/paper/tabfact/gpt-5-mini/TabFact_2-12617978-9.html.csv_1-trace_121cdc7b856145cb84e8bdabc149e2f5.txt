Claim interpreted: The Dragons' Den company Reestore requested 50,000 and the investing dragons were Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact7 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.dragons_den_uk with columns: episode, first aired, entrepreneur (s), company or product name, money requested, investing dragon (s)

Evidence query and result:
Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, "first aired", "entrepreneur (s)", "company or product name", "money requested", "investing dragon (s)", (lower("investing dragon (s)") LIKE '%deborah meaden%' AND lower("investing dragon (s)") LIKE '%theo paphitis%') AS both_deborah_theo_invested FROM dragons_den_uk WHERE lower("company or product name") LIKE '%reestore%';

Result:
- episode: episode 4
- first aired: 5 november 2007
- entrepreneur(s): max mcmurdo
- company or product name: reestore
- money requested: 50000
- investing dragon(s): deborah meaden & theo paphitis
- both Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis invested: true

Assessment of claim components:
- Company name: Reestore — matches exactly.
- Money requested: 50,000 — matches the “money requested” value of 50000.
- Investing dragons: Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis — matches the “investing dragon(s)” field.

Conclusion: The data directly supports that Reestore requested 50,000 and the investors were Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis.

Assumptions:
- “request 50000” is interpreted as the money requested field (currency not explicitly stated in the table; presumed GBP consistent with UK Dragons’ Den).
- “from Deborah Meaden & Theo Paphitis” is interpreted as these being the investing dragons listed for the pitch.
- Matching for “Reestore” and dragon names was case-insensitive substring matching.
