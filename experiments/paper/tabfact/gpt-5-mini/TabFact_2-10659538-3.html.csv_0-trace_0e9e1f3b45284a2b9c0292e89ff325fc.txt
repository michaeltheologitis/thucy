Claim interpreted: A New Orleans Saints game had an attendance of 66,189, and the team whose season context we’re viewing had a 6–1 record at that point.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact34). The only table with game-by-game NFL data including attendance is t_2001_st_louis_rams_season.

- week: 14, date: december 17 , 2001, opponent: new orleans saints, result: w 34 - 21, record: 11 - 2, attendance: 70332

2) Find any game with attendance exactly 66,189
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance FROM t_2001_st_louis_rams_season WHERE attendance = 66189;
Returned rows:
- week: 7, date: october 28 , 2001, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 34 - 31, record: 6 - 1, attendance: 66189

Conclusion
- The data shows that on October 28, 2001 (Week 7), the St. Louis Rams played the New Orleans Saints. The attendance was 66,189 and the Rams’ running record at that time was 6–1. This directly supports the claim as phrased.

Assumptions
- “Record of 6–1” refers to the Rams’ running season record at the time of that Saints game (since the table represents the Rams’ season). The claim is interpreted as referencing this specific game instance in the available data.
