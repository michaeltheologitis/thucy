Claim to verify: “12.40 be the departure time of the train go to Boston.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema).
- Identified a transportation-like table: public.my_info_table with columns: departure (text), going to (text), calling at (text), arrival (double precision), operator (text).

Executed evidence queries and results
1) Query: List all entries going to Boston
SQL:
SELECT "departure", "going to", "calling at", "arrival", "operator"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "going to" ILIKE 'Boston';
Result:
[ {"departure": "12.40", "going to": "boston", "calling at": "boston", "arrival": 13, "operator": "gnr"} ]

2) Query: Check if any Boston entry departs exactly at '12.40' or '12:40'
SQL:
SELECT "departure", "going to", "calling at", "arrival", "operator"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "going to" ILIKE 'Boston'
  AND ("departure" = '12.40' OR "departure" = '12:40');
Result:
[ {"departure": "12.40", "going to": "boston", "calling at": "boston", "arrival": 13, "operator": "gnr"} ]

3) Query: Count of Boston entries with departure '12.40' or '12:40'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "going to" ILIKE 'Boston'
  AND ("departure" = '12.40' OR "departure" = '12:40');
Result:
[ {"cnt": 1} ]

Assessment
- The table contains an entry for a train going to Boston with departure time recorded as "12.40" (text). No entry at "12:40" was necessary; the exact match is "12.40".
- Therefore, the claim that the train to Boston departs at 12.40 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Destination matching used case-insensitive comparison (ILIKE 'Boston') to include 'boston'.
- “12.40” is interpreted as a time format equivalent to 12:40, and exact string equality on the stored text value was used for verification.
- The table public.my_info_table is treated as authoritative for the relevant schedule information.
