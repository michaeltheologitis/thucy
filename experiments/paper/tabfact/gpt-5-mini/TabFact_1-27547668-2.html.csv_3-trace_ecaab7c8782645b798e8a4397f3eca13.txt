Claim interpreted: “There are 3 different directors who directed 2 episodes.” Dataset used: TabFact database, table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (Republic of Doyle episodes).

Evidence from data
- Query 1 (list directors with exactly 2 episodes):
SQL:
SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
GROUP BY "directed by"
HAVING COUNT(*) = 2
ORDER BY "directed by";
Result:
- {"directed by": "mike clattenburg", "cnt": 2}
- {"directed by": "robert lieberman", "cnt": 2}
- {"directed by": "steve dimarco", "cnt": 2}

- Query 2 (count how many such directors there are):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_directors_with_2_episodes
FROM (
  SELECT "directed by"
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  GROUP BY "directed by"
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 2
) sub;
Result:
- {"num_directors_with_2_episodes": 3}
