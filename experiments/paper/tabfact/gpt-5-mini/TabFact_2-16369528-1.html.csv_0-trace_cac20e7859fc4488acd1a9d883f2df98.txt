Claim interpreted: There are 3 years where both the "reader 's vote" and the "lifetime achievement" fields are recorded as 'na' in the data.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL (TabFact) public schema.

Relevant schema located
- Table: public.ned_kelly_awards
  - Columns: year (bigint), "reader 's vote" (text), "lifetime achievement" (text), plus others.

Step 1: Check how missing values are represented in the two columns
Executed SQL (distinct values and counts for "reader 's vote"):
SELECT "reader 's vote" AS value, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY "reader 's vote"
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST, value;
Result (abridged): 'na' = 14, 'apartment 255 by bunty avieson' = 1, 'bleeding hearts by lindy cameron' = 1

Executed SQL (NULL count for "reader 's vote"):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" IS NULL;
Result: null_count = 0

Executed SQL (distinct values and counts for "lifetime achievement"):
SELECT "lifetime achievement" AS value, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY "lifetime achievement"
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST, value;
Result (abridged): 'na' = 3; multiple named honorees each = 1

Executed SQL (NULL count for "lifetime achievement"):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "lifetime achievement" IS NULL;
Result: null_count = 0

Interpretation: In both columns, missing values are encoded as the literal text 'na' (not SQL NULL).

Step 2: Count rows where both columns are 'na' and list the years
Executed SQL (count rows where both are 'na'):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" = 'na'
  AND "lifetime achievement" = 'na';
Result: count_rows = 3

Executed SQL (list the years for those rows):
SELECT year
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" = 'na'
  AND "lifetime achievement" = 'na'
ORDER BY year;
Result: years = 1998, 2000, 2011

Conclusion: The data shows exactly 3 years where both "reader 's vote" and "lifetime achievement" are 'na'.

Assumptions
- Treated 'na' as the literal text string, case-sensitive as stored, not as SQL NULL or other variants (e.g., 'NA', 'n/a').
