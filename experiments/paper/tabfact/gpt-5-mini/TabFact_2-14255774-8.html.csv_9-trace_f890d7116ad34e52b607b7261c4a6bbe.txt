Claim to verify: “the highest attendance of the season be on september 5.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL (postgres_tabfact6), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (interpreted as the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season game log).

Schema details (from the data source):
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Initial format check (sample rows):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, attendance, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 10;
- Observations: date is lowercase text like “september 5”; attendance is an integer.

Evidence 1: Maximum attendance of the season
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
- Result: max_attendance = 54137

Evidence 2: Which game(s) reached that maximum
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE attendance = 54137 ORDER BY date;
- Result: date = “september 7”, opponent = “dodgers”, attendance = 54137

Evidence 3: Attendance on September 5
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%September 5%' OR date ILIKE '%Sep 5%' OR date ILIKE '%Sept 5%' OR date ILIKE '%9/5%' OR date ILIKE '%09/05%';
- Result: date = “september 5”, opponent = “dodgers”, attendance = 52270

Evidence 4: Top attendances for additional context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance
  FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  WHERE attendance IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY attendance DESC
  LIMIT 5;
- Result (highest first):
  1) September 7 — Dodgers — 54137
  2) September 5 — Dodgers — 52270
  3) September 6 — Dodgers — 47543
  4) September 13 — Reds — 45075
  5) September 19 — Rockies — 43137

Conclusion:
- The highest attendance recorded in the season dataset is 54,137 on September 7. September 5 had 52,270, which is not the highest. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “the season” refers to the dataset available: the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season (table public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season).
- “september 5” refers to the date stored in the table as text (matched case-insensitively).
