Claim interpreted: “France’s competitor[s] all finish better than 5th.” I verify this against the available results table for the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships in our data source.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact32 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), "sp + fs" (bigint), points (double precision), places (double precision)

Evidence from SQL (executed)
1) List all competitors from France
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE nation = 'france' ORDER BY rank;
Result rows:
- rank: 7, name: patrice macrez, nation: france, sp + fs: 6, points: 151.76, places: 71
- rank: 8, name: pierre lamine,   nation: france, sp + fs: 8, points: 150.50, places: 79

2) Check if all French competitors finished better than 5th (rank < 5)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_french,
       SUM(CASE WHEN rank < 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS better_than_5_count,
       SUM(CASE WHEN rank >= 5 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS at_least_5_count
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE nation = 'france';
Result:
- total_french: 2
- better_than_5_count: 0
- at_least_5_count: 2

3) French competitors with rank >= 5
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE nation = 'france' AND rank >= 5 ORDER BY rank;
Result rows:
- rank: 7, name: patrice macrez, nation: france
- rank: 8, name: pierre lamine,   nation: france

Conclusion
- The data shows France’s competitors placed 7th and 8th. Therefore, it is false that all of France’s competitors finished better than 5th.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated against the available table for the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships, which appears to contain competitor results for that event. “Better than 5th” is interpreted as rank strictly less than 5 (i.e., 1st–4th).
