Conclusion: Verified. In the available viral_disease dataset, there are 13 distinct virus families whose virion shape is recorded as exactly “icosahedral”.

Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact16), public schema.
- Table: viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect distinct virion shape values to confirm the exact term to match
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "virion shape" FROM viral_disease ORDER BY "virion shape";
- Result (distinct values):
  - complex
  - helical
  - helical , bullet shaped
  - icosahedral
  - spherical

2) Count distinct families with virion shape exactly equal to 'icosahedral'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';
- Result: distinct_family_count = 13

3) List those families (to verify the count and provide transparency)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT family
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral'
  ORDER BY family;
- Result (13 families):
  adenoviridae, astroviridae, caliciviridae, flaviviridae, hepadnaviridae, hepeviridae, papillomaviridae, parvoviridae, picornaviridae, polyomaviridae, reoviridae, retroviridae, togaviridae

Assessment:
- The dataset shows 13 distinct virus families labeled with virion shape “icosahedral”. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Viral family” refers to distinct values in the family column.
- “Icosahedral virion shape” is taken as an exact match to the value icosahedral in the virion shape column (not including other shapes like spherical or composite entries).
