Claim interpreted: “Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino direct more than 3 episodes together.” I interpret “together” as both being credited as directors on the same episode (co-directors). Given the available data, I evaluate this within the scope of Gilmore Girls episodes.

Data discovery and schema
- Discovered data sources: One PostgreSQL database with a public table named public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes (episode listings for Gilmore Girls).
- Table columns: no (bigint), - (bigint), title (text), director (text), writer (s) (text), original air date (text), prod code (bigint), us viewers (million) (double precision).
- Director credits are stored in the director (text) column.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Search for co-directed episodes (both Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino in the same director field)
SQL (list):
SELECT no, title, director
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE lower(director) LIKE '%amy%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%sherman%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%palladino%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%daniel%';
Result: 0 rows returned.

SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE lower(director) LIKE '%amy%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%sherman%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%palladino%'
  AND lower(director) LIKE '%daniel%';
Result: cnt = 0

Interpretation: No Gilmore Girls episode lists both Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino as co-directors.

2) Episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino (to show individual directing credits)
SQL (list):
SELECT no, title, director
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy Sherman-Palladino%' OR director ILIKE '%Amy Sherman%' OR director ILIKE '%Sherman-Palladino%'
ORDER BY no;
Result:
- no: 66, title: ballrooms and biscotti, director: amy sherman - palladino

SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy Sherman-Palladino%' OR director ILIKE '%Amy Sherman%' OR director ILIKE '%Sherman-Palladino%';
Result: 1

3) Episodes directed by Daniel Palladino (to show individual directing credits)
SQL (list):
SELECT no, title, director
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE director ILIKE '%daniel palladino%'
ORDER BY no;
Result:
- no: 83, title: tick , tick , tick , boom!, director: daniel palladino

SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE director ILIKE '%daniel palladino%';
Result: 1

Conclusion
- Within the authoritative Gilmore Girls episode dataset, there are zero episodes co-directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino. Therefore, the claim that they “direct more than 3 episodes together” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Scope: Due to available data, I evaluated the claim within the Gilmore Girls episodes dataset. I did not have data for their other series.
- “Together” means co-director credit on the same episode.
- Name matching was done case-insensitively and robustly to accommodate punctuation and spacing variations in the “director” field.
