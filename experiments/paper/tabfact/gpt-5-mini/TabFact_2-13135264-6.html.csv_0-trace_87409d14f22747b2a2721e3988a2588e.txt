Claim to verify: "detroit have the highest visitor score, with 5 point"

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
- The table contains columns "visitor" and "score"; scores appear as "X - Y" where X is the visiting team’s goals.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Maximum visitor goals across the table
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS max_visitor_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
Result: [{"max_visitor_goals": 5}]

2) Which visiting team(s) achieved that maximum
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT visitor
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) = (
  SELECT MAX(CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER))
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
);
Result: [{"visitor": "detroit"}]

3) Detroit’s maximum goals when playing as the visitor
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS detroit_max_visitor_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE lower(visitor) = 'detroit';
Result: [{"detroit_max_visitor_goals": 5}]

4) The specific game(s) where a visitor scored the maximum
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) AS visitor_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) = 5
ORDER BY date;
Result: [{"date":"january 22","visitor":"detroit","score":"5 - 4","home":"los angeles","decision":"joseph","attendance":18118,"record":"28 - 14 - 6 - 2","visitor_goals":5}]

Conclusion:
- The highest visitor score in this dataset is 5.
- Detroit is the (only) visiting team that achieved this maximum.
- Therefore, the claim that "detroit have the highest visitor score, with 5 point" is supported by the data in this table.

Assumptions made:
- "Visitor score" is interpreted as the number of goals scored by the visiting team, extracted as the left-hand number in the "score" field formatted as "X - Y".
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season table).
