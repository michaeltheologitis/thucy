Claim to verify:
"game number 72 on march 28 be against cleveland with a score of w 94 - 80 (ot)"

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL TabFact database (public schema)
- Identified relevant table: public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season (per-game entries for the 2001–02 Toronto Raptors season)

Evidence:
1) Retrieve game 72 details
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE game = 72;
Result:
- game: 72
- date: march 28
- team: atlanta
- score: w 85 - 83 (ot)
- high points: antonio davis , morris peterson (15)
- high rebounds: antonio davis (9)
- high assists: chris childs (7)
- location attendance: philips arena 12036
- record: 34 - 38

Finding: Game 72 was on March 28, but the opponent was Atlanta, and the score was W 85-83 (OT), not Cleveland and not 94-80.

2) Check for any games against Cleveland
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score
FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season
WHERE team ILIKE '%Cleveland%'
ORDER BY game;
Result:
- Game 69 — date: march 22 — team: cleveland — score: w 94 - 80 (ot)

Finding: The Raptors did beat Cleveland 94-80 (OT), but it was Game 69 on March 22, not Game 72 on March 28.

3) Confirm the unique occurrence of the exact score text
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE score = 'w 94 - 80 (ot)';
Result:
- game: 69, date: march 22, team: cleveland, score: w 94 - 80 (ot)

Conclusion:
- Correct: Game 72 occurred on March 28 and went to OT.
- Incorrect: The opponent was Atlanta (not Cleveland), and the score was W 85-83 (OT) (not W 94-80 (OT)). The W 94-80 (OT) win over Cleveland corresponds to Game 69 on March 22.

Assumptions:
- Because the available authoritative data source contains a single NBA season table (2001–02 Toronto Raptors), I interpret the claim as referring to the 2001–02 Toronto Raptors season.
