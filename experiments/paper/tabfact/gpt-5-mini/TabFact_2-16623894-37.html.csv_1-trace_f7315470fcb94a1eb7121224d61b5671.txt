Claim to verify: "werder bremen, who be in team 2, have a score of 4 - 4 in the 2nd leg."

Data discovery and grounding:
- Available source: A PostgreSQL TabFact instance with one relevant table in the public schema: t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league.
- Schema (from exploration): Columns — "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text).

Evidence retrieval:
1) Exact case-sensitive check for team 2 = 'Werder Bremen'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league WHERE "team 2" = 'Werder Bremen';
Result:
cnt = 0

2) Case-insensitive search for records where team 2 contains 'Werder'
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg"
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE "team 2" ILIKE '%Werder%';
Result (one row):
- team 1 = valencia
- agg = 5 - 5 ( a )
- team 2 = werder bremen
- 1st leg = 1 - 1
- 2nd leg = 4 - 4

Assessment:
- The table contains a tie where team 2 is "werder bremen" and the "2nd leg" score is "4 - 4". This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim within the available dataset t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league (2009–10 season). The team name match was performed case-insensitively because the stored value is lowercase ("werder bremen").
