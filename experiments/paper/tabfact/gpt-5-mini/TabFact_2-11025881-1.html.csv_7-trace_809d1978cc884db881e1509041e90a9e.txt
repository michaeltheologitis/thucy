Claim: “pierre lamine beat shinji someya by more than a point.”

Data sources checked
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact31), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships

Evidence
1) Identify both competitors and their points/ranks
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, nation, rank, points
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%pierre%'
   OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%lamine%'
   OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%shinji%'
   OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%someya%';

Result rows:
- pierre lamine | france | rank 8 | points 150.5
- shinji someya | japan  | rank 9 | points 150.34

2) Compute the point difference directly
Executed SQL:
SELECT t1.rank AS lamine_rank, t1.points AS lamine_points, t2.rank AS someya_rank, t2.points AS someya_points, (t1.points - t2.points) AS point_diff
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships t1
JOIN public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships t2 ON TRUE
WHERE t1.name = 'pierre lamine' AND t2.name = 'shinji someya';

Returned:
- lamine_rank = 8, lamine_points = 150.5
- someya_rank = 9, someya_points = 150.34
- point_diff = 0.1599999999999966 (≈ 0.16)

Assessment
- “Beat”: Supported. Pierre Lamine placed ahead of Shinji Someya (rank 8 vs 9) and had more points (150.5 vs 150.34).
- “By more than a point”: Not supported. The margin is approximately 0.16 points, which is less than one point.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a true element (Lamine beat Someya) with a false element (the margin was not more than a point).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the event captured in the available dataset (1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships), and “beat” is determined by rank/points recorded in this table.
