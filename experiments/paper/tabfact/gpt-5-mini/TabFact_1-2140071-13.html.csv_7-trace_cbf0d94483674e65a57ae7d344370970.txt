Conclusion: The claim is partly inaccurate. The episode with coach “Rebecca Star” and the summary “ashley is made into a circus performer” exists, but it is Season 13, Episode 13, and premiered on October 15, 2012—not Episode 11 on October 9, 2012. On October 9, 2012, a different episode (Season 13, Episode 9) aired with coach BJ Coleman and a different summary. Season 13, Episode 11 aired on October 11, 2012 with coach Katie Kansas.

Evidence from the data (TabFact -> public.made_tv_series):

1) Find any episode with coach name containing “Rebecca Star”
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary"
FROM public.made_tv_series
WHERE coach ILIKE '%Rebecca Star%'
ORDER BY season, episode;
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 13
- premier date: october 15 , 2012
- coach: rebecca star
- episode summary: ashley is made into a circus performer
Interpretation: Confirms that Rebecca Star is the coach for an episode whose summary matches “ashley is made into a circus performer,” and its premiere date is October 15, 2012 (not October 9). The episode number is 13 (not 11).

2) Find episodes with premier date of October 9, 2012
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary"
FROM made_tv_series
WHERE "premier date" ~* '^\s*october\s+9\s*,\s*2012\s*$';
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 9
- premier date: october 9 , 2012
- coach: bj coleman
- episode summary: chris is made into a celebrity assistant
Interpretation: On October 9, 2012, the episode that aired was Season 13, Episode 9, and it did not feature Rebecca Star nor the Ashley/circus summary.

3) Confirm episodes whose summary contains both “Ashley” and “circus”
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary"
FROM public.made_tv_series
WHERE "episode summary" ILIKE '%ashley%' AND "episode summary" ILIKE '%circus%';
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 13
- premier date: october 15 , 2012
- coach: rebecca star
- episode summary: ashley is made into a circus performer
Interpretation: Reinforces that the Ashley/circus episode is Season 13, Episode 13, premiering October 15, 2012 with coach Rebecca Star.

4) Show details for Season 13, Episode 11
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE season = 13 AND episode = 11;
Result:
- season: 13
- episode: 11
- premier date: october 11 , 2012
- coach: katie kansas
- episode summary: shambre is made into a gogo dancer
Interpretation: Season 13, Episode 11 aired on October 11, 2012, with coach Katie Kansas and a different summary.

Overall assessment of each claim element:
- “episode 11” → Incorrect for the Rebecca Star/Ashley circus episode (it is Episode 13).
- “premier on october 9 , 2012” → Incorrect for that episode (it premiered on October 15, 2012). October 9, 2012 corresponds to Season 13, Episode 9 with coach BJ Coleman.
- “coach name rebecca star” → Correct for the Ashley/circus episode.
- “summary … ashley is made into a circus performer” → Correct for the Rebecca Star episode.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to MTV’s “Made” TV series episodes, based on the available data source “made_tv_series.”
- Treated the single accessible database as authoritative and complete for verification within its scope.
