Summary conclusion: Supported by the TabFact database table for the 2001 Cincinnati Bengals season. Week 12 corresponds to the date text “december 2 , 2001,” matching the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with public schema. Identified table: t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season.

Schema inspected
- public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve the date for week 12
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 12;
- Result: “december 2 , 2001”

2) Cross-check: retrieve the week for the exact date text “december 2 , 2001”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE date = 'december 2 , 2001';
- Result: week = 12

Interpretation
- Both directions (week → date and date → week) confirm the mapping. The string formatting (lowercase “december” and a space before the comma) matches the stored value exactly and matches the phrasing in the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the schedule data in the TabFact public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season table, where “week 12” refers to the week column and the date is taken from the date text field.
