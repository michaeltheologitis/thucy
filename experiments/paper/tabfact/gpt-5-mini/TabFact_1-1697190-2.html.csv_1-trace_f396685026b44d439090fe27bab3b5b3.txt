Claim to verify: “casey martin never win a tournament.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data environment: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.casey_martin with columns: year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, money list rank.

What I checked
1) Whether there are any seasons where Casey Martin recorded at least one win.
2) The total number of wins across all recorded seasons.
3) Full season-by-season record to confirm the wins column is consistently zero.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Seasons with at least one win
SQL:
SELECT year, wins, "best finish" FROM public.casey_martin WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY year;
Result: 0 rows returned (no seasons with wins > 0).

2) Total career wins (sum over all seasons)
SQL:
SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.casey_martin;
Result: [{"total_wins": 0}]

3) Full season-by-season record for context
SQL:
SELECT year, "tournaments played", "cuts made", wins, "best finish", earnings, "money list rank" FROM public.casey_martin ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1998: tournaments played = 3, cuts made = 2, wins = 0, best finish = t - 23, earnings = $37,221, money list rank = 221
- 2000: tournaments played = 29, cuts made = 14, wins = 0, best finish = t - 17, earnings = $143,248, money list rank = 179
- 2001: tournaments played = 2, cuts made = 0, wins = 0, best finish = cut, earnings = $0, money list rank = n / a
- 2002: tournaments played = 3, cuts made = 0, wins = 0, best finish = cut, earnings = $0, money list rank = n / a
- 2003: tournaments played = 1, cuts made = 0, wins = 0, best finish = cut, earnings = $0, money list rank = n / a
- 2004: tournaments played = 2, cuts made = 2, wins = 0, best finish = t - 69, earnings = $15,858, money list rank = n / a
- 2005: tournaments played = 1, cuts made = 1, wins = 0, best finish = t - 65, earnings = $10,547, money list rank = n / a

Conclusion
- The available data show zero wins across all recorded seasons. The claim that “Casey Martin never won a tournament” is supported by this dataset.

Assumptions noted
- “Tournament” is interpreted as tournaments captured by the public.casey_martin table (likely the events tracked for his professional season records in this dataset). No additional tables are available to check other circuits or non-tracked events.
- The subject is Casey Martin, the professional golfer, as indicated by the table name and columns.
