Claim to verify
"Sweden and Canada are the only country on the table that do not receive a medal in 2 of the category."

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), Schema: public
- Table used: t_1988_winter_olympics (columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total)

Method
- Interpreted “category” as the medal types: gold, silver, bronze.
- A country that “does not receive a medal in 2 of the category” would have zero medals in two out of the three medal-type columns (i.e., medals in exactly one category).
- Computed, for each nation, the number of medal categories with zero medals and checked which nations have zeros in exactly two categories.

Evidence (with exact executed SQL)
1) Inspect all nations and compute the count of zero-medal categories
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total, 
       (CASE WHEN gold=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN silver=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN bronze=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS zero_categories
FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
ORDER BY nation;

Key results observed:
- canada (can): gold=0, silver=2, bronze=3, total=5, zero_categories=1
- sweden (swe): gold=4, silver=0, bronze=2, total=6, zero_categories=1
- All other listed nations have zero_categories=0 (none have zero_categories=2)

2) Directly count nations with zeros in exactly two medal categories
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM (
  SELECT (CASE WHEN gold=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN silver=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN bronze=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS zero_categories
  FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
) sub WHERE zero_categories = 2;

Result:
- cnt = 0

3) Show nations with exactly one zero-medal category (for context)
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total, 
       (CASE WHEN gold=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN silver=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN bronze=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS zero_categories
FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
WHERE (CASE WHEN gold=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN silver=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) + (CASE WHEN bronze=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 1
ORDER BY nation;

Result rows:
- canada (can): gold=0, silver=2, bronze=3, total=5, zero_categories=1
- sweden (swe): gold=4, silver=0, bronze=2, total=6, zero_categories=1

Findings
- No nation has zero medals in two categories (zero_categories = 2). Count = 0.
- Sweden and Canada each have zero medals in exactly one category (zero_categories = 1), meaning they received medals in two categories, not in only one.

Conclusion
The claim is not supported by the data. Sweden and Canada are not countries that failed to medal in two categories; rather, they each failed to medal in one category.

Assumptions
- “Category” refers to medal types (gold, silver, bronze).
- “Do not receive a medal in 2 of the category” is interpreted as having zeros in two of the three medal categories (i.e., medals in exactly one category).
