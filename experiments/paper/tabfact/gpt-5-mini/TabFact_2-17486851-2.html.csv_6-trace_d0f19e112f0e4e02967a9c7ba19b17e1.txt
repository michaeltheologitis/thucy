Interpretation: The user appears to request entries where the column type equals "retirement".

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a reachable PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema) with table t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season.
- Relevant columns: nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE LOWER("type") = 'retirement';

Results:
- nat: gre; name: machlas; moving to: retired; type: retirement; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: -; source: contragr

Conclusion: The dataset contains at least one record where type is "retirement"; the matching row(s) are listed above.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the request "por type be retirement" as a request to retrieve rows whose type equals "retirement" (case-insensitive) from the available dataset.
- No other relevant tables were available in the connected data environment beyond t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season.
