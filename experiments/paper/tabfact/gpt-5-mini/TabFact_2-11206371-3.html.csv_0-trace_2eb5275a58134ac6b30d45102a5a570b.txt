Summary of the claim
- Claim: “paddock’s last appearance be in ‘Blood is Thicker Than Water’, and red squirrel’s last appearance be in ‘A Hero’s Welcome’.”

What I checked
- I searched the TabFact (PostgreSQL) database for a table containing character appearance information. The relevant table is public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters, which includes columns “animal name,” “first appearance,” and “last appearance.”

Findings from the data
- The table contains:
  - animal name: paddock — last appearance: blood is thicker then water (2x12)
  - animal name: red squirrels — last appearance: a hero’s welcome (2x01)
- Notes:
  - The database uses lowercase and, for red squirrel, the plural form (“red squirrels”).
  - The database spells the episode title for Paddock’s last appearance as “blood is thicker then water” (with “then” instead of “than”).

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Exact-name lookup (no rows, because of case/pluralization differences):
SELECT "animal name", "first appearance", "last appearance"
FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters
WHERE "animal name" IN ('Paddock', 'Red Squirrel');

2) Case-insensitive/substring lookup (returned the matching rows used as evidence):
SELECT "animal name", "first appearance", "last appearance"
FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters
WHERE "animal name" ILIKE '%Paddock%' OR "animal name" ILIKE '%Red Squirrel%';

Conclusion
- Paddock: The data supports that Paddock’s last appearance is “blood is thicker then water (2x12).” This matches the user’s claim in substance, with only a minor spelling difference (then vs than).
- Red Squirrel: The data supports that Red Squirrel(s)’ last appearance is “a hero’s welcome (2x01).” This matches the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “red squirrel” to refer to the entry labeled “red squirrels” (plural) in the database.
- I treated the spelling variation “then” vs “than” in the episode title as a minor discrepancy in the source data that does not change the substance of the claim.
