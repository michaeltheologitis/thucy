Overview
- I explored the available data source (postgres_tabfact13, schema public) and found one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season, which lists R.S.C. Anderlecht players and their goals in the 2008–09 season across competitions (columns: player, league, title playoff, super cup, total).

Key Evidence from the Data
1) Full table ordered by total goals (shows the entire scoring distribution)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total
FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
ORDER BY total DESC;
- Result (all 19 rows):
1) mbark boussoufa — league: 11, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 11
2) tom de sutter — league: 9, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 9
3) guillaume gillet — league: 8, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 9
4) marcin wasilewski — league: 8, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 8
5) jonathan legear — league: 5, title playoff: 1, super cup: 0, total: 7
6) nicolás frutos — league: 6, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 6
7) thomas chatelle — league: 4, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 4
8) roland juhász — league: 4, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 4
9) stanislav vlček — league: 4, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 4
10) lucas biglia — league: 2, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
11) dmitri bulykin — league: 3, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
12) jan polák — league: 2, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
13) matías suárez — league: 1, title playoff: 0, super cup: 1, total: 3
14) jelle van damme — league: 3, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 3
15) oleksandr iakovenko — league: 2, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 2
16) hernán losada — league: 1, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 2
17) víctor bernárdez — league: 1, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 1
18) bart goor — league: 1, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 1
19) nemanja rnić — league: 0, title playoff: 0, super cup: 0, total: 1

2) Identify the top scorer in this table
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season ORDER BY total DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 1;
- Result: {"player":"mbark boussoufa","total":11}

3) Matías Suárez’s total goals
- Executed SQL (name inspection first):
SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season ORDER BY player LIMIT 50;
- Partial result shows entry {"player":"matías suárez","total":3}
- Executed SQL (direct lookup):
SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player = 'matías suárez';
- Result: [{"player":"matías suárez","total":3}]

4) Bart Goor’s total goals
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player ILIKE '%Goor%';
- Result: player = 'bart goor', total = 1

5) Number of players (scorers) listed
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;
- Result: player_count = 19

Assessment of the Claim
- Claim part: “4 player from Belgian First Division A be in the top 19 scorer”
  - Evidence: The table represents R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season scorers; all 19 rows are Anderlecht players, a club in Belgium’s First Division A. Thus, within this dataset, 19 out of 19 scorers are from Belgian First Division A, not 4. This part is not supported by the data.
- Claim part: “the top scorer (matias suarez)”
  - Evidence: The top scorer in the table is Mbark Boussoufa with 11 total goals (see SQL #2). Matías Suárez has 3 total goals (see SQL #3). This part is contradicted by the data.
- Claim part: “have 5 fewer goal than bart goor , who have 11 goal”
  - Evidence: Bart Goor has 1 total goal in this table (see SQL #4), not 11. The top scorer has 11 (Mbark Boussoufa), and Matías Suárez has 3. This part is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is inconsistent with the available authoritative data for the 2008–09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season. Specifically, the top scorer is not Matías Suárez, Bart Goor does not have 11 goals, and the count of Belgian First Division A players among the listed scorers is 19, not 4.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim in the context of the only available dataset: the 2008–09 R.S.C. Anderlecht season scoring table. “Top 19 scorers” was taken to mean all 19 players listed with at least one goal in this table. I treated the 'total' column as total goals across the competitions represented by the columns (league, title playoff, super cup).
