Claim to verify: “denis menchov on the rabobank team score 40 uci point.”

Data discovery and grounding:
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact18 (public schema)
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya with columns [cyclist, country, team, time, uci points]. This table contains UCI points for riders in the 2007 Volta a Catalunya.

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT cyclist, team, "uci points" FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE cyclist ILIKE '%Denis%' AND cyclist ILIKE '%Menchov%';
- Result row:
  {"cyclist":"denis menchov", "team":"rabobank", "uci points":"40"}

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists Denis Menchov with team “rabobank” and “uci points” equal to “40”. This directly supports the claim as stated.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the available dataset (2007 Volta a Catalunya). The “40 UCI points” refers to the UCI points recorded for this event in that table. The user did not specify event/year, so I map the claim to the discovered authoritative data containing Denis Menchov, Rabobank, and UCI points.
