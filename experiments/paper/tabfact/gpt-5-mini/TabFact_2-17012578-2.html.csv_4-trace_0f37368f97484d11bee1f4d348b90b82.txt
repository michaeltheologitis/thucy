Summary
- Interpreted claim: "Tyler Forrest be the lead in Beausejour" as asking whether Tyler Forrest is listed as the lead for a team from Beausejour in the available dataset.

Data source discovery
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4), schema public.
- Schema contains a single relevant table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials with columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city (all text).

Verification steps and SQL evidence
1) Exact match check (case-sensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city = 'Beausejour' AND lead = 'Tyler Forrest';
Result:
[{"cnt":0}]
Interpretation: No exact-case match found.

2) Case-insensitive, trimmed match check
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE TRIM(city) ILIKE 'Beausejour' AND TRIM(lead) ILIKE 'Tyler Forrest';
Result:
[{"cnt":1}]
Interpretation: One matching row exists when ignoring case/whitespace.

3) Retrieve the matching row
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE TRIM(city) ILIKE 'Beausejour' AND TRIM(lead) ILIKE 'Tyler Forrest' LIMIT 10;
Result:
[{"city":"beausejour","lead":"tyler forrest","second":"braden zawada","skip":"jason gunnlaugson","third / vice skip":"justin richter"}]
Interpretation: In the 2009 Canadian Olympic curling trials table, the team from beausejour lists tyler forrest as the lead.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: Tyler Forrest is listed as the lead for the Beausejour team in the 2009 Canadian Olympic curling trials table.

Assumptions
- Treated the claim as referring to the curling team role “lead” for the city Beausejour in the discovered dataset, and accepted case-insensitive matching to account for data casing.
