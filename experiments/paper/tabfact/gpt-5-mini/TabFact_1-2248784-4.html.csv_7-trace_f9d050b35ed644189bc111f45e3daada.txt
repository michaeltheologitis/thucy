Claim: "iran have the lowest mideast rank"

Summary of data source exploration
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database TabFact/postgres_tabfact21, schema public.
- Relevant table: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
- Table columns: "rank mideast" (bigint), "rank asia" (bigint), "rank world" (bigint), "country" (text), "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision)
- The table includes Middle East ranking via the column "rank mideast".

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Iran’s Middle East rank
- SQL executed:
SELECT "rank mideast", country FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE LOWER(country) LIKE '%iran%';
- Result:
country: iran
rank mideast: 1

2) Minimum Middle East rank value and countries holding it
- SQL executed:
SELECT MIN("rank mideast") AS min_rank_mideast FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp;
- Result:
min_rank_mideast = 1

- SQL executed:
SELECT country FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE "rank mideast" = 1 ORDER BY country;
- Result:
country = iran

3) Context: Maximum Middle East rank value and the country at that rank
- SQL executed:
SELECT MAX("rank mideast") AS max_rank_mideast FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp;
- Result:
max_rank_mideast = 13

- SQL executed:
SELECT country, "rank mideast" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE "rank mideast" = 13 ORDER BY country;
- Result:
country = bahrain, rank mideast = 13

Conclusion
- The data shows Iran’s "rank mideast" equals 1, which is the minimum value among Middle East ranks in this dataset. Interpreting “lowest rank” as the smallest numerical rank, the claim is supported by the evidence from the table list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp.

Assumptions
- “Lowest mideast rank” is interpreted as the smallest numerical value in the column "rank mideast" (i.e., rank 1 is the top position).
- The verification is limited to the dataset available (Asian and Pacific countries, 2011 GDP (PPP)); we treat this source as authoritative within its scope as per the instructions.
