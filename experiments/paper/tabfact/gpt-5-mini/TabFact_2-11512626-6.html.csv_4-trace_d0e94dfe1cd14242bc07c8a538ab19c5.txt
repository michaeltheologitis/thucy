Summary conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. On August 27, the Rockies won 7-5 vs. the Reds; the losing pitcher was Remlinger (6 - 6), and the Rockies’ record became 64 - 70.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance “TabFact” (public schema).

Schema inspection:
- Table: t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Initial scan to confirm date format and presence of August entries
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
LIMIT 50;
Result excerpt (relevant row among others):
{ "attendance":48032, "date":"august 27", "loss":"remlinger (6 - 6)", "opponent":"reds", "record":"64 - 70", "score":"7 - 5" }

2) Targeted retrieval for August 27
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
WHERE date = 'august 27';
Result:
{ "attendance":48032, "date":"august 27", "loss":"remlinger (6 - 6)", "opponent":"reds", "record":"64 - 70", "score":"7 - 5" }

Assessment against the claim:
- “on august 27” → Matches date = “august 27”.
- “remlinger (6 - 6) take the loss” → Matches loss = “remlinger (6 - 6)”.
- “as the rockies go to 64 - 70” → Matches record = “64 - 70”.

Assumptions made:
- The table t_1997_colorado_rockies_season represents the 1997 MLB season for the Colorado Rockies and stores dates in lowercase text (e.g., “august 27”).
- “Remlinger” refers to pitcher Mike Remlinger, consistent with the loss field text.
