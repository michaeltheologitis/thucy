Findings:
- The 1943 VFL season table shows that on 21 August 1943 at Glenferrie Oval, the match was Hawthorn (home) vs South Melbourne (away). North Melbourne were not the away team in that match.
- North Melbourne did play on 21 August 1943, but as the away team at Princes Park against Carlton, not at Glenferrie Oval.

Evidence with executed SQL:
1) Determine the teams at Glenferrie Oval on 21 August 1943

SELECT "date", "venue", "home team", "away team", ("away team" = 'North Melbourne') AS away_is_north_melbourne
FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season
WHERE "date" ILIKE '%21%1943%' AND "venue" ILIKE '%Glenferrie%';

Result:

Result:

Conclusion:
- The match at Glenferrie Oval on 21 August 1943 featured Hawthorn vs South Melbourne; North Melbourne were not the away team there. North Melbourne were away at Princes Park that day.
