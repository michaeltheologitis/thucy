Claim to verify: “only 2 time be the attendance less than 20000 crowd and it be on august 4 and august 5.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) How many games had attendance < 20,000?
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS games_under_20000 FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE attendance < 20000;
- Result: games_under_20000 = 2

2) Which dates had attendance < 20,000?
- SQL:
  SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE attendance < 20000 ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  - august 4 — 15,230
  - august 5 — 16,428

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly two games with attendance below 20,000, and they occurred on august 4 and august 5. This fully supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “less than 20000” strictly as attendance < 20000 (not including exactly 20,000).
- The claim pertains to the dataset available: the 1997 Colorado Rockies season table identified in the TabFact database. Dates are stored as lowercase text in that table.
