Claim interpreted: The final scoreline for the opponent against Katerina Maleeva in a final was 6 - 2, 7 - 5.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered available source: a PostgreSQL instance for the TabFact dataset (schema: public). Only relevant table found: public.isabel_cueto, which includes columns for date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, and score.

Schema identified:
- Table: public.isabel_cueto
  - date (text)
  - tournament (text)
  - surface (text)
  - opponent in the final (text)
  - score (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Search for finals where the opponent in the final is Katerina Maleeva
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", score
FROM public.isabel_cueto
WHERE "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%maleev%' OR "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%katerina%';
Result:
- date: 31 july 1989
- tournament: sofia , bulgaria
- surface: clay
- opponent in the final: katerina maleeva
- score: 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 (3)

2) Verify whether any row shows a score containing '7 - 5' against Katerina Maleeva
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.isabel_cueto WHERE "opponent in the final" ILIKE 'katerina maleeva' AND "score" ILIKE '%7 - 5%';
Result:
- match_count = 0

Assessment:
- The data shows a final against Katerina Maleeva with the score 6 - 2, 7 - 6 (3), not 6 - 2, 7 - 5. The first set (6 - 2) matches the claim, but the second set differs.

Conclusion: The claim is not fully supported by the available data; it contains a significant error in the second-set scoreline.

Assumptions:
- The phrase “the opponent against Katerina Maleeva in the final” refers to the winner listed in the isabel_cueto table, where Katerina Maleeva is the opponent in the final.
- The TabFact database (public.isabel_cueto) is the authoritative and only accessible source for this verification; no other databases were available for cross-checking.
