Claim interpreted: “the surface be grass on 2 may 1999.” Interpreted as: In the available data, the entry dated 2 May 1999 has surface = grass.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database for the TabFact project with a public schema containing table: public.leanne_baker (columns: outcome, date, location, surface, "opponent in final", score; all text; no PK/FK).

Evidence gathered:
1) Check the surface for the date 2 may 1999
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, surface FROM public.leanne_baker WHERE date ILIKE '2 may 1999';
Result:
- date: 2 may 1999; surface: hard

2) Confirm the number of matching rows for that date
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.leanne_baker WHERE date ILIKE '2 may 1999';
Result:
- count: 1

Analysis:
- The only row dated “2 may 1999” lists surface = “hard,” not “grass.”

Conclusion:
- The claim that the surface is grass on 2 May 1999 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the record(s) in the public.leanne_baker table for the date text “2 may 1999.”
- Matching on date used a case-insensitive exact comparison (ILIKE without wildcards).
