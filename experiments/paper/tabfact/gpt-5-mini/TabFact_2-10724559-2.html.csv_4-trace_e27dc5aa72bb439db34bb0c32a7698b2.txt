Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Diego Milito had 0 goals in a debut year that was before 2008.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13), public schema
- Table: public.football_records_in_italy with columns: rank, all - time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, apps

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Diego Milito’s record
SQL:
SELECT name, "debut year", goals, apps FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name ILIKE '%Milito%';
Result:
- name: diego milito
- debut year: 2008
- goals: 86
- apps: 145

2) Check if any Diego Milito row has a debut year before 2008 or zero goals
SQL:
SELECT name, "debut year", goals, apps
FROM public.football_records_in_italy
WHERE lower(name) = 'diego milito'
  AND ("debut year" < 2008 OR goals = 0);
Result: no matching rows found

Assessment:
- The only Diego Milito entry shows debut year = 2008 and goals = 86. There is no record indicating a debut year before 2008, nor any record with 0 goals. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Debut year" is taken directly from the table’s "debut year" field (reflecting how this dataset defines a player’s debut in Italy).
- "0 goal occur" is interpreted as total goals (the "goals" field) equal to 0.
- Name matching was performed case-insensitively to account for lowercase storage of names in the dataset.
