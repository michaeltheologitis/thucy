Claim to verify: "in 1962, the VFL began in July."

Summary conclusion: The available season data for 1962 shows league matches on 23 June 1962, which is before July. Therefore, the season was already underway in June, and the claim is false.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1962_vfl_season (columns: "home team" text, "home team score" text, "away team" text, "away team score" text, "venue" text, "crowd" bigint, "date" text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Sample match rows from the 1962 VFL season table
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", crowd, "date" FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season LIMIT 30;
Result (6 rows): all six matches have date = "23 june 1962" (examples: Melbourne vs St Kilda at MCG; Essendon vs Geelong at Windy Hill; etc.)

2) Row count of the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Result: 6

3) Distinct date strings present in the table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season ORDER BY "date" LIMIT 30;
Result: "23 june 1962"

4) Check for any July 1962 entries
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt, min("date") AS min_date, max("date") AS max_date
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE "date" LIKE '%1962%'
  AND ( "date" ILIKE '%jul%' OR "date" ILIKE '%july%' OR "date" LIKE '%/7/%' OR "date" LIKE '%/07/%' );
Result: { cnt: 0, min_date: NULL, max_date: NULL }

Reasoning:
- The dataset for the 1962 VFL season contains matches dated 23 June 1962, and no entries indicating July dates. The presence of official season matches in June directly contradicts the claim that the season began in July.

Assumptions:
- The table public.t_1962_vfl_season reflects official match records for the 1962 VFL season (i.e., regular-season fixtures).
- The claim is interpreted as “The 1962 VFL season began in July.”
