Summary
- Claim interpreted: "Chris Young was the winning pitcher on June 25."
- Scope: Verified against the available MLB-related table for the 2005 Texas Rangers season in the TabFact database.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database for TabFact with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season (columns: date [text], winning team [text], score [text], winning pitcher [text], losing pitcher [text], attendance [bigint], location [text]).

Evidence and queries
- Task: Identify the row for June 25 and see the winning pitcher.
- Executed SQL (as returned by the tool):
  SELECT date, "winning pitcher" FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%June 25%' OR date ILIKE '%Jun 25%' OR date ILIKE '%6/25%' OR date ILIKE '%06/25%';
- Result returned by the database:
  { date: "june 25", winning pitcher: "chris young" }

Assessment
- The table explicitly records the date as "june 25" and the winning pitcher as "chris young" for the 2005 Texas Rangers season, directly supporting the claim within this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data: on June 25 (as recorded in the 2005 Texas Rangers season table), the winning pitcher is listed as Chris Young.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible relevant data source is the 2005 Texas Rangers season table, I interpret the claim as referring to the Rangers’ game on June 25, 2005. The table stores dates as text and uses lowercase for names/dates; matching was done case-insensitively.
