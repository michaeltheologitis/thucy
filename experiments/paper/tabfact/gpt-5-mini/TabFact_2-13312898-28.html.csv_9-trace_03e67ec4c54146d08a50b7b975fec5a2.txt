Data source discovery
- Accessible source: TabFact Postgres database, schema public.
- Available table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history (round, pick, overall, name, position, college).

Schema check (confirm available fields)
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='indianapolis_colts_draft_history' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Returned:
[{"column_name":"round","data_type":"bigint"}, {"column_name":"pick","data_type":"bigint"}, {"column_name":"overall","data_type":"bigint"}, {"column_name":"name","data_type":"text"}, {"column_name":"position","data_type":"text"}, {"column_name":"college","data_type":"text"}]
Note: No year column; round information is present.

Evidence: Curtis Dickey
Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Curtis Dickey%';
Returned:
[{"college":"texas a&m","name":"curtis dickey","overall":5,"pick":5,"position":"running back","round":1}]
Finding: Curtis Dickey is listed as a round 1 pick (not round 2).

Evidence: Randy Bielski
Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Randy Bielski%' OR name ILIKE '%Bielski%';
Returned:
[{"college":"towson","name":"randy bielski","overall":311,"pick":6,"position":"placekicker","round":12}]
Finding: Randy Bielski is listed as a round 12 pick (not round 2).

Conclusion
- Curtis Dickey: Round 1 (not round 2).
- Randy Bielski: Round 12 (not round 2).
The claim that both were picked in round 2 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to NFL draft selections for the Baltimore/Indianapolis Colts franchise, which is the scope of the available dataset.
