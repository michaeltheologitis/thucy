Claim interpreted: The episode titled “arienai kisu” aired 7 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date in the dataset.

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5)
- Table: public.tsuki_no_koibito
- Relevant columns: "romanized title" (text), "episode title" (text), "broadcast date" (text)
- Note: "broadcast date" is stored as text and was parsed using to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY').

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Earliest broadcast date in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT "episode title", "broadcast date", to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') AS bcast_date
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
  WHERE to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY bcast_date ASC
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: episode title = "おまえが欲しい", broadcast date = 2010-05-10 (parsed from "may 10 , 2010").

2) Broadcast date for “arienai kisu”
- SQL:
  SELECT "episode title", "romanized title", "broadcast date", to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') AS bcast_date
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
  WHERE lower(trim("romanized title")) = 'arienai kisu';
- Result: romanized title = "arienai kisu", broadcast date = 2010-05-17 (parsed from "may 17 , 2010").

3) Day difference between “arienai kisu” and the earliest broadcast
- SQL:
  SELECT earliest.title AS earliest_title,
         earliest.bcast_date AS earliest_date,
         arienai.bcast_date AS arienai_date,
         (arienai.bcast_date - earliest.bcast_date) AS day_difference
  FROM (
    SELECT to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') AS bcast_date, "episode title" AS title
    FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
    WHERE to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY bcast_date ASC
    LIMIT 1
  ) earliest,
  (
    SELECT to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') AS bcast_date, "episode title"
    FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
    WHERE lower(trim("romanized title")) = 'arienai kisu'
    LIMIT 1
  ) arienai;
- Result: earliest_date = 2010-05-10, arienai_date = 2010-05-17, day_difference = 7.

Conclusion: The data shows “arienai kisu” aired exactly 7 days after the earliest broadcast in the table. The claim is supported by the evidence above.

Assumptions made:
- “Title” refers to entries in public.tsuki_no_koibito and the comparison is across all rows in that table.
- “7 day” means a difference of 7 calendar days between parsed dates.
- Dates parsed with to_date(initcap("broadcast date"), 'Month DD , YYYY') accurately reflect the intended broadcast dates in the data.
