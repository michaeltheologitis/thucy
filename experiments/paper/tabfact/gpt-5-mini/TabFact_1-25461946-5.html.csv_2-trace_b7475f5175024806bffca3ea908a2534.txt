Summary
- Data source explored: PostgreSQL database 'TabFact', public schema. It contains one relevant table: t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team, which records per-game entries for the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season, including a text-based date field.

Evidence
1) Retrieve all games on November 27
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", game, team, score, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team
WHERE ("date" ILIKE '%November 27%' OR ("date" ILIKE '%Nov%' AND "date" ILIKE '%27%') OR "date" ILIKE '%11/27%')
ORDER BY game;
Result:
- date: november 27; game: 5; team: virginia tech; score: W 61 - 50; location/attendance: palestra , philadelphia , pa (3750)
Interpretation: Exactly one row appears for November 27.

2) Count games on November 27
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE date ILIKE 'november 27';
Result: {"count": 1}
Interpretation: The dataset has one game on that date.

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one game recorded on November 27 in this dataset. This supports the claim that only one game was played on November 27 (as represented in the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball team table).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the games represented in the available dataset (2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season) rather than all sports or leagues.
- Date values are stored as text; matching was done case-insensitively for 'november 27' and common variants.
- No year was specified in the claim; the relevant November 27 in this dataset corresponds to the season covered by the table.
