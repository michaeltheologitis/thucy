Claim assessed: "week 9 be before october 30 , 1983"

Interpretation: The claim asserts that the date recorded for Week 9 occurs strictly before October 30, 1983.

Data sources consulted:
- Database: postgres_tabfact25
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Findings:
- The table entry for week 9 has the date text: "october 30 , 1983".
- When parsed, this corresponds to 1983-10-30.
- A strict comparison shows this is not before 1983-10-30 (it is equal), so the claim is false.

Executed SQL and results:
1) Retrieve the original date text for week 9
SQL:
SELECT week, date FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE week = 9;
Result:
[{"week":9, "date":"october 30 , 1983"}]

2) Parse the date and test if it is strictly before 1983-10-30
SQL:
SELECT week, date, to_date(regexp_replace(date,'\\s*,\\s*',',','g'),'FMMonth DD,YYYY')::date AS parsed_date, (to_date(regexp_replace(date,'\\s*,\\s*',',','g'),'FMMonth DD,YYYY') < DATE '1983-10-30') AS before_oct30 FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE week = 9;
Result:
[{"week":9, "date":"october 30 , 1983", "parsed_date":"1983-10-30", "before_oct30":false}]

Conclusion: Week 9 is on October 30, 1983, not before it. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "before" is interpreted as strictly earlier than (i.e., <, not ≤) October 30, 1983.
- The month/day/year in the date column is parsed using the pattern FMMonth DD,YYYY after normalizing spaces around the comma.
