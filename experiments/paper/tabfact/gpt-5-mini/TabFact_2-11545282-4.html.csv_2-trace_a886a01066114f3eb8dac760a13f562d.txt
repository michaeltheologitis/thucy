Claim interpreted: On the Utah Jazz, Adrian Dantley was on the team for the entire period that Brad Davis was on the team.

Evidence from available data (TabFact Postgres, public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster):

1) Adrian Dantley tenure on the Jazz
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE 'Adrian Dantley';
Result:
- player: adrian dantley
- years for jazz: 1979 - 86

2) Brad Davis tenure on the Jazz
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Brad Davis%';
Result:
- player: brad davis
- years for jazz: 1979 - 80

Assessment:
- Brad Davis’s entire Jazz tenure (1979–80) falls within Adrian Dantley’s Jazz tenure (1979–86). Therefore, Dantley was on the Jazz for the entire time that Brad Davis was on the Jazz.

Assumptions:
- “the team” refers specifically to the Utah Jazz, as that is the only team for which authoritative roster/tenure data is available in the connected data source.
