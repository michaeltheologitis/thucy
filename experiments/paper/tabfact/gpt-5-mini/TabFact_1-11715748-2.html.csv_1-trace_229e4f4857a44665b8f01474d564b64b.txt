Claim interpreted: “Gilbert Adler directed ‘Funhouse.’”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema.
- Identified table: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes with columns: series (bigint), season (bigint), title (text), director (s) (text), writer (s) (text), original airdate (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Search for any record where the title contains “Funhouse” or the director includes “Adler”/“Gilbert”.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes
WHERE title ILIKE '%Funhouse%'
   OR "director (s)" ILIKE '%Adler%'
   OR "director (s)" ILIKE '%Gilbert%';

Result (1 matching row):
- series: 39
- season: 17
- title: funhouse
- director (s): gilbert adler
- writer (s): al katz and gilbert adler
- original airdate: february 5 , 1990

Assessment
- The database shows an episode titled “funhouse” of Freddy’s Nightmares directed by “gilbert adler,” aired February 5, 1990. This directly supports the claim that Gilbert Adler directed “Funhouse,” when “Funhouse” is taken to refer to this TV episode.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data available: Gilbert Adler is listed as the director for the “Funhouse” episode of Freddy’s Nightmares.

Assumptions and scope
- The data source covers a list of Freddy’s Nightmares episodes. The claim could alternatively refer to the 1981 feature film “The Funhouse,” which is outside the scope of this dataset. My verification is limited to the TV episode evidenced in the available database.
