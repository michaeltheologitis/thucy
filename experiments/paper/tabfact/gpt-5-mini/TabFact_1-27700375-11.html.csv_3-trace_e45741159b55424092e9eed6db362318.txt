Claim assessed: “Brook Lopez lead the team in points for 5 straight games.”

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9)
- Table: public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season (2010–11 New Jersey Nets season). Relevant columns include: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

Formatting check for the “high points” field

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS len, MIN(game) AS start_game, MAX(game) AS end_game, string_agg(CAST(game AS text),', ' ORDER BY game) AS games
  FROM (
    SELECT game, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY game) AS rn
    FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
    WHERE lower("high points") LIKE '%brook lopez%'
  ) t
  GROUP BY (game - rn)
  ORDER BY start_game;
- Result:
