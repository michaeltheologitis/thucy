Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact14), schema public, with a single table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs.

Step 2 — Inspect schema
- Table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
- Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (bigint), player (text), country (text), points (bigint), events (bigint), "reset points" (bigint)
- No keys or constraints reported.

Step 3 — Verify the 8th-ranked player by points (descending)
- Executed SQL to list top 10 by points:
  SELECT player, country, points FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY points DESC, player ASC LIMIT 10;
- Top results returned (abridged):
  1. tiger woods — united states — 30574
  2. vijay singh — fiji — 19129
  3. jim furyk — united states — 16691
  4. phil mickelson — united states — 16037
  5. kj choi — south korea — 15485
  6. rory sabbatini — south africa — 13548
  7. zach johnson — united states — 13341
  8. charles howell iii — united states — 12126
  9. brandt snedeker — united states — 11870
- Executed SQL to retrieve the 8th row explicitly:
  SELECT player, country, points FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY points DESC, player ASC OFFSET 7 LIMIT 1;
- Result: charles howell iii — united states — 12126
- Finding: By points-based ranking, the 8th-ranked player’s country is “united states”.

Step 4 — Cross-check using "reset points" (descending)
- Executed SQL to list top by reset points:
  SELECT player, country, "reset points" FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY "reset points" DESC NULLS LAST, player ASC LIMIT 10;
- Results (top returned):
  1. tiger woods — united states — 100000
  2. vijay singh — fiji — 99000
  3. jim furyk — united states — 98500
  4. phil mickelson — united states — 98000
  5. kj choi — south korea — 97500
  6. rory sabbatini — south africa — 97250
  7. zach johnson — united states — 97000
  8. charles howell iii — united states — 96750
  9. brandt snedeker — united states — 96500
- Executed SQL to retrieve the 8th row explicitly:
  SELECT player, country, "reset points" FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY "reset points" DESC NULLS LAST, player ASC OFFSET 7 LIMIT 1;
- Result: charles howell iii — united states — 96750
- Finding: By reset-points ranking, the 8th-ranked player’s country is also “united states”.

Conclusion
- In this dataset (2007 FedEx Cup Playoffs), the 8th-ranked player is Charles Howell III, and his listed country is “united states.” This holds whether ranking by points or by reset points. Therefore, the claim that “the united state be the home country of the 8th-rank player” is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “8th-rank player” refers to the ordering by a points metric in the available table; I evaluated both points and reset points.
- Ties (if any) are broken deterministically by player name ascending to ensure stable ordering.
- The claim pertains to the available 2007 FedEx Cup Playoffs table, as it is the only accessible dataset.
