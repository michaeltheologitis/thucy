Claim being checked: "the player from portugal be rank number 1"

Interpretation used for verification:
- Interpreted "player" as the athlete(s) in the available dataset (table: public.my_info_table), which contains rowing entries with columns: rank, rowers, country, time, notes.
- Interpreted "from portugal" as rows where country contains "Portugal".
- Interpreted "rank number 1" as rank = 1.

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table(rank bigint, rowers text, country text, time text, notes text)

Evidence and executed SQL with results:
1) Check existence of any Portugal entry
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(country) LIKE '%portugal%';
Result:
count: 1

2) Retrieve Portugal row(s) and their ranks
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rowers, country, time, notes FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(country) LIKE '%portugal%';
Result (one row):
rank: 1
rowers: pedro fraga , nuno mendes
country: portugal
time: 6:39.07
notes: sa / b

3) Confirm if any Portugal entry has rank = 1
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS rank1_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(country) LIKE '%portugal%' AND rank = 1;
Result:
rank1_count: 1

Conclusion based on data:
- The dataset contains a Portugal entry (rowers: Pedro Fraga and Nuno Mendes) whose rank is 1. Thus, within the available data, the claim is supported.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- "Player" is mapped to the rowing athlete(s) listed in my_info_table.
- The verification is limited to the connected data source; other sports or external rankings are out of scope here.
- "Rank number 1" is taken to mean a rank value equal to 1 in the table.
