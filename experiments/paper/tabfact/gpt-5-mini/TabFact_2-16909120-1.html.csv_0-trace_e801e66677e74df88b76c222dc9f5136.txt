Claim to verify: “217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville.”

Data source discovery:
- Connected source: TabFact (public schema, PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table (via schema exploration): public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives with columns including "1st lbsc no" (bigint) and "lbsc name" (text).

Evidence
1) Find all entries named “Granville” and list their 1st LBSC numbers in ascending order
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives WHERE lower("lbsc name") = 'granville' ORDER BY "1st lbsc no" ASC;
Result:
- {"1st lbsc no": 216, "1st sr no": "-", "2nd lbsc no": "-", "2ns sr no": "-", "built": 1883, "lbsc name": "granville", "withdrawn": 1911}

2) Compute the minimum 1st LBSC number among entries named “Granville”
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN("1st lbsc no") AS min_1st_lbsc_no FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives WHERE lower("lbsc name") = 'granville';
Result:
- min_1st_lbsc_no: 216

3) Check what name corresponds to 1st LBSC number 217
Executed SQL:
SELECT "1st lbsc no", "lbsc name", "built", "2nd lbsc no", "1st sr no", "2ns sr no", "withdrawn"
FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives
WHERE "1st lbsc no" = 217;
Result:
- {"1st lbsc no": 217, "lbsc name": "northcote", "built": 1883, "2nd lbsc no": "620", "1st sr no": "-", "2ns sr no": "-", "withdrawn": 1927}

4) Broad substring check for any variants containing “granville”
Executed SQL:
SELECT "1st lbsc no", "lbsc name", "2nd lbsc no", "1st sr no", "2ns sr no", "built", "withdrawn"
FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives
WHERE "lbsc name" ILIKE '%granville%';
Result:
- 1st lbsc no: 216; lbsc name: granville; 2nd lbsc no: -; 1st sr no: -; 2ns sr no: -; built: 1883; withdrawn: 1911

Findings
- The only entry named “Granville” has a 1st LBSC number of 216; thus the minimum (lowest) is 216, not 217.
- 1st LBSC number 217 corresponds to the name “northcote,” not “granville.”

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: the lowest 1st LBSC number with LBSC name “Granville” is 216, not 217.

Assumptions
- “Lowest” refers to the minimum numeric value of the column "1st lbsc no".
- Matching on name is case-insensitive and based on the table public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives (LB&SCR B1 class locomotives).
