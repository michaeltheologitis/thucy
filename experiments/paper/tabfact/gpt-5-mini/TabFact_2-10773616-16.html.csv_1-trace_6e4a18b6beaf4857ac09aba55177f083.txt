Summary
- Claim interpreted: “Melbourne is the team with the highest away team score.” Interpreted within the available dataset (1954 VFL season table) as the highest single-game away total points.
- Finding: Supported. Melbourne recorded the highest away-team total (94 points) in this table.

Data source and schema
- Data source discovered: TabFact Postgres instance (public schema).
- Table used: public.t_1954_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Determine the maximum away-team total points in the table
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX((substring("away team score" from $$\((\d+)\)$$))::int) AS max_away_points FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
Result:
max_away_points = 94

2) Retrieve the game(s) at that maximum away-team total
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","crowd","date", (substring("away team score" from $$\((\d+)\)$$))::int AS away_points 
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
WHERE (substring("away team score" from $$\((\d+)\)$$))::int = 94;
Result row(s):
- home team: richmond | home team score: 10.18 (78) | away team: melbourne | away team score: 15.4 (94) | venue: punt road oval | crowd: 24000 | date: 14 august 1954 | away_points: 94

Conclusion
- Melbourne is the away team with the highest single-game away score (94 points) in the 1954 VFL season table. No other away team reached 94 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Highest away team score” refers to the single-game highest total points by an away team (the integer inside parentheses in the score string, e.g., “15.4 (94)” → 94), not an average or cumulative season total.
- Verification is confined to the available dataset (1954 VFL season) and not across other seasons or leagues.
