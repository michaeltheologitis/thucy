Claim to verify:
- For the 2010–2011 season: winner = Kanto Gakuin University, attendance = N/A, title = 37th.

Step 1 — Identify the 2010–2011 season record
Executed SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season ~ '2010[[:space:]]*[-–—][[:space:]]*(2011|11)';

Result (one row):
- title: 47th
- season: 2010 - 11 details
- winner: teikyo
- score: 17 - 14
- runner - up: waseda
- venue: national stadium , tokyo , tokyo
- attendance: 25458

Finding:
- For 2010–2011, the table shows title = 47th, winner = teikyo, attendance = 25458. This directly contradicts the claim’s winner, attendance, and title.

Step 2 — Check what the 37th edition corresponds to
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, season, winner FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE title = '37th';

Result:
- title: 37th
- season: 2000 - 1 details
- winner: kanto gakuin university

Executed SQL (full row to confirm attendance):
SELECT * FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE title = '37th';

Result (one row):
- title: 37th
- season: 2000 - 1 details
- winner: kanto gakuin university
- score: 42 - 15
- runner - up: hosei
- venue: national stadium , tokyo , tokyo
- attendance: n / a

Finding:
- The 37th edition corresponds to season 2000–01 and lists Kanto Gakuin University as the winner with attendance "n / a". This appears to be the source of the values in the claim, but they are for 2000–01 (37th), not 2010–11 (47th).

Overall assessment of the claim’s components for 2010–2011:
- Winner = Kanto Gakuin University: False (data shows winner = teikyo)
- Attendance = N/A: False (data shows attendance = 25458)
- Title = 37th: False (data shows title = 47th)

Correct data for 2010–2011 from the table:
- Title: 47th
- Winner: teikyo
- Attendance: 25458

Assumptions:
- "2010 - 2011 detail" in the claim refers to the row whose season text is stored as "2010 - 11 details" in the dataset. The regex used in Step 1 captured this season variant.
