Claim assessed: “globular cluster have less apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy.”

Summary conclusion
- Within the only available dataset (NGC objects 5001–6000), the single globular cluster listed (NGC 5466) has a numerically lower apparent magnitude (brighter) than the two irregular galaxies listed (NGC 5408 and NGC 5477). Thus, in this dataset, the claim is supported. Generalization beyond this dataset cannot be established here.

Data source discovery
- Available data asset: PostgreSQL schema public with one table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.

Schema details (queried via schema tool)
- Columns: "ngc number" (bigint), "object type" (text), "constellation" (text), "right ascension ( j2000 )" (text), "declination ( j2000 )" (text), "apparent magnitude" (double precision).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify object types present
SQL:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result (object type — count):
- irregular galaxy — 2
- spiral galaxy — 2
- globular cluster — 1

2) Compare apparent magnitudes for globular cluster vs irregular galaxy (aggregates)
SQL:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_magnitude, MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_magnitude, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_magnitude
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IN ('globular cluster','irregular galaxy')
GROUP BY "object type";
Results:
- globular cluster: count = 1, min = 10.5, max = 10.5, avg = 10.5
- irregular galaxy: count = 2, min = 14.0, max = 14.5, avg = 14.25
Interpretation: Lower numerical magnitude indicates brighter appearance. Here, the globular cluster (10.5) is brighter than the irregular galaxies (14.0–14.5).

3) Individual rows for transparency
SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IN ('globular cluster','irregular galaxy')
ORDER BY "object type", "apparent magnitude" NULLS LAST, "ngc number";
Rows:
- 5466 | globular cluster | 10.5
- 5408 | irregular galaxy | 14.0
- 5477 | irregular galaxy | 14.5

Conclusion
- Supported by the available data: the listed globular cluster has a lower (brighter) apparent magnitude than the listed irregular galaxies. Scope limitation: the table covers NGC objects 5001–6000 and includes only one globular cluster and two irregular galaxies; broader claims cannot be established from this dataset alone.

Assumptions
- “Less apparent magnitude” is interpreted as a numerically smaller magnitude value (brighter object) per the astronomical magnitude scale.
- Verification is confined to the available dataset (public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000).
