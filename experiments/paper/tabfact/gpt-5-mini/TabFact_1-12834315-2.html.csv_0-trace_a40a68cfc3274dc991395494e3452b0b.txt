Claim: “The AR-15A3 Competition HBAR has a barrel length of 16 in.”

Data source exploration:
- Available database discovered: TabFact (public schema) containing table: my_info_table with relevant columns including “name”, “colt model no”, and “barrel length”.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%AR-15A3%' OR name ILIKE '%Competition HBAR%' OR name ILIKE '%Competition%' OR "colt model no" ILIKE '%AR-15A3%' OR "colt model no" ILIKE '%Competition%' OR "colt model no" ILIKE '%HBAR%';

- Result row matching the model:
  { "barrel length": "16 in", "barrel profile": "hbar", "barrel twist": "1:9", "bayonet lug": "no", "case deflector": "yes", "colt model no": "r6731", "fire control": "s - 1", "forward assist": "yes", "hand guards": "short ribbed", "muzzle device": "a2", "name": "ar - 15a3 competition hbar", "rear sight": "a2", "stock": "a2" }

Assessment:
- The row named “ar - 15a3 competition hbar” explicitly lists “barrel length” = “16 in”, directly supporting the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the user’s model as the row with name “ar - 15a3 competition hbar” (Colt model no r6731). If a different variant was intended, results could differ by model designation.
