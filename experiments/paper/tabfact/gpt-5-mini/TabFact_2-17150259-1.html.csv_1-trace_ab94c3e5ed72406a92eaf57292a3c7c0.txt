Claim: “lugo , emilia - romagna be the venue when the competition be friendly on 26 may 1999 and the result be 2 - 4.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.karen_walker_footballer with columns: date (text), venue (text), result (text), competition (text), goal (bigint), scored (bigint).

What I checked and found (with executed SQL and results):
1) Retrieve the row for the specified date and competition (case-insensitive) to confirm venue and result.
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, result, competition FROM public.karen_walker_footballer WHERE lower(date) = '26 may 1999' AND lower(competition) = 'friendly';
Result:
- date: 26 may 1999
- venue: lugo , emilia - romagna
- result: 1 - 4
- competition: friendly

2) Independent venue-based lookup to corroborate the same row.
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, result, competition
FROM public.karen_walker_footballer
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Lugo%' OR venue ILIKE '%Emilia-Romagna%'
ORDER BY date;
Result includes:
- 26 may 1999 | lugo , emilia - romagna | 1 - 4 | friendly

Assessment:
- Venue: Matches the claim (lugo , emilia - romagna) — Supported
- Competition: Matches the claim (friendly) — Supported
- Date: Matches the claim (26 may 1999) — Supported
- Result: Does not match; data shows 1 - 4, not 2 - 4 — Not supported

Conclusion: The venue, competition, and date are correct, but the result is wrong. Therefore, the overall claim is not fully accurate.

Assumptions:
- Treated the TabFact public.karen_walker_footballer table as the authoritative source for this verification.
- Used case-insensitive matching for textual date and competition fields since the table stores date as text (e.g., “26 may 1999”).
