Claim interpreted: “the dolphin finish the regular season with a 12-4 record.” I interpret “the dolphin” to mean the Miami Dolphins, and verify this against the available season-level game data.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema, table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect the 1983 Miami Dolphins game results
- SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week ASC LIMIT 20;
- Result excerpt (weeks 1–16 shown; table has 16 rows total):
  • Week 1: result = "w 12 - 0"
  • Week 2: result = "w 34 - 24"
  • Week 3: result = "l 27 - 14"
  • Week 4: result = "w 14 - 6"
  • Week 5: result = "l 17 - 7"
  • Week 6: result = "l 38 - 35"
  • Week 7: result = "w 32 - 14"
  • Week 8: result = "w 21 - 7"
  • Week 9: result = "w 30 - 14"
  • Week 10: result = "w 20 - 17"
  • Week 11: result = "l 17 - 6"
  • Week 12: result = "w 37 - 0"
  • Week 13: result = "w 38 - 14"
  • Week 14: result = "w 24 - 17"
  • Week 15: result = "w 31 - 24"
  • Week 16: result = "w 34 - 14"

2) Compute wins, losses, and record from the results column (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' OR lower(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_games,
  CONCAT(SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), '-', SUM(CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS record
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
- Result: {"wins": 12, "losses": 4, "total_games": 16, "record": "12-4"}

3) Confirm data covers exactly the regular season weeks (1–16)
- SQL:
SELECT MIN(week) AS min_week, MAX(week) AS max_week FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
- Result: min_week = 1, max_week = 16
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_week_gt_16 FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season WHERE week > 16;
- Result: count_week_gt_16 = 0

Conclusion grounded in data
- The 1983 Miami Dolphins finished their regular season with a 12-4 record. The table contains exactly 16 regular-season games (weeks 1–16) and the aggregated results show 12 wins and 4 losses.

Assumptions
- “the dolphin” refers to the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- The available dataset pertains to the 1983 season; verification is thus for the 1983 Miami Dolphins. If a different season/team was intended, it is outside the scope of the accessible data.
