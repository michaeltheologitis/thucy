Claim: “tough love be the title of episode 148.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public.
- Relevant table identified: public.full_house_season_7 with columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve the episode with overall series number 148 and its title
- SQL:
  SELECT "no in series", "no in season", "title" FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE "no in series" = 148;
- Result:
  { "no in series": 148, "no in season": 4, "title": "tough love" }

2) Confirm that the title “tough love” exists and corresponds to that episode number
- SQL:
  SELECT "no in series", "no in season", "title" FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE lower(title) = 'tough love';
- Result:
  { "no in series": 148, "no in season": 4, "title": "tough love" }

Conclusion
- The data show that in the Full House series, episode number 148 (overall in series) has the title “tough love.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “episode 148” as the overall series episode number for the show represented in the accessible dataset (Full House), since this is the only TV-episode data available via the connected sources.
- Title matching is exact aside from case, as stored in the database.
