Claim being checked: “team brazil be the only football club locate on the south american continent.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table discovered: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  - Columns: no (text), football club (text), continent (text), associated football club (text), seasons (text), racing drivers (text)

What the data shows
1) Distinct continents and counts in the table
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT COALESCE(continent, '(NULL)') AS continent, COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  GROUP BY continent
  ORDER BY row_count DESC, continent;
- Result:
  - europe: 9
  - asia: 2
  - oceania: 2
  - s america: 1
- Interpretation: The table uses “s america” to represent South America, and there is exactly 1 entry for that continent.

2) Which row(s) are in South America
- Evidence (executed SQL, sequence used to locate the correct label and then extract rows):
  1) SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "continent" ILIKE 'South America';
     Result: [{"cnt":0}] (indicates the label isn’t literally “South America”)
  2) SELECT DISTINCT "continent", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs GROUP BY "continent" ORDER BY cnt DESC;
     Result: [{"cnt":9,"continent":"europe"},{"cnt":2,"continent":"asia"},{"cnt":2,"continent":"oceania"},{"cnt":1,"continent":"s america"}]
  3) SELECT "football club", "associated football club", "seasons" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "continent" ILIKE '%s america%';
     Result: [{"football club":"team brazil","associated football club":"none","seasons":"2011"}]
- Interpretation: The only entry tagged to South America (as “s america”) is “team brazil.”

3) Are there any other entries mentioning “Brazil”
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT "football club", "associated football club", "continent"
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%'
     OR "associated football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%';
- Result: team brazil | none | s america
- Interpretation: No other rows referencing Brazil exist in this table.

4) Totals (context)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs;
  Result: total_rows = 14

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS south_america_rows FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE continent = 'South America';
  Result: south_america_rows = 0 (because the table stores the value as “s america,” not the full phrase)
- Interpretation: The exact stored label is “s america,” under which there is 1 row (as shown above).

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (the list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs table), Team Brazil is the only entry labeled with the South American continent (“s america”). The data also shows “associated football club: none” for Team Brazil, indicating it is not associated with a specific football club in this table, but it is still listed under the “football club” column.

Verdict: Partly Verified
- The dataset supports the uniqueness of Team Brazil as the only entry from South America in this table.
- However, the claim’s wording suggests a broader real-world assertion (“only football club located on the South American continent”), which this dataset alone cannot substantiate beyond its own entries, and the row shows “associated football club: none,” which complicates the label “football club.”

Assumptions made
- “South American continent” corresponds to the table’s continent value “s america.”
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the discovered table (public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs), not as a universal statement about all football clubs worldwide.
