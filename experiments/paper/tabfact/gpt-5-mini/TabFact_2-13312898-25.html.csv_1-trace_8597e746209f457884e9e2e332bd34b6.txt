Claim interpreted: "Glenn Capriola was selected with the 24th pick in the 9th round."

Data sources explored:
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (public schema) with table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history.
- Schema (indianapolis_colts_draft_history): columns = round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Name-based lookup
- SQL:
  SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  WHERE name ILIKE '%capriola%';
- Result:
  round: 9; pick: 24; overall: 247; name: glenn capriola; position: running back; college: boston college.

2) Round/pick-based lookup
- SQL:
  SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  WHERE round = 9 AND pick = 24;
- Result (1 row):
  round: 9; pick: 24; overall: 247; name: glenn capriola; position: running back; college: boston college.

Assessment:
- The database record shows Glenn Capriola was selected in round 9 with pick 24 (overall 247). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim within the available data context (Indianapolis Colts draft history). "Pick" is taken as the pick number within the round. The claim did not specify team or year; verification is grounded in the Colts dataset accessible here.
