Claim interpreted: “On average, Galina Voskoboeva loses by only 4 point.” Because the available dataset contains only match scores (not point-by-point totals), I interpret “point” as “games,” and compute the average game margin in matches she lost in this table.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14), schema public, table: galina_voskoboeva with columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score.

What the data shows
- The table contains 5 rows (final results labeled winner or runner-up). We computed the total games won by Voskoboeva and her opponent in each loss (outcome = runner - up) by parsing the set-by-set scores, then averaged the game differences.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all rows (to understand available data and score formats)
SQL executed:
SELECT outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
Returned rows (abridged):
1) runner - up | 28 january 2003 | tipton | hard (i) | matea mezak | 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6
2) winner      | 29 june 2003    | mont - de - marsan | hard (i) | oleksandra kravets | 6 - 4 , 6 - 2
3) runner - up | 3 october 2003  | latina | clay | roberta vinci | 3 - 6 , 4 - 6
4) runner - up | 8 november 2005 | pittsburgh | hard | lilia osterloh | 6 - 7 , 4 - 6
5) winner      | 6 june 2006     | cuneo , italy | clay | alice canepa | 6 - 1 , 6 - 2

2) Inspect only the losses (runner-up) to confirm raw scores
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, opponent, score FROM public.galina_voskoboeva WHERE outcome = 'runner - up' ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date":"28 january 2003","opponent":"matea mezak","score":"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6","tournament":"tipton"},{"date":"3 october 2003","opponent":"roberta vinci","score":"3 - 6 , 4 - 6","tournament":"latina"},{"date":"8 november 2005","opponent":"lilia osterloh","score":"6 - 7 , 4 - 6","tournament":"pittsburgh"}]

3) Compute per-match game totals and differences for those losses
SQL executed:
WITH per_set AS (
  SELECT
    date, tournament, opponent, score,
    trim(s) as setscore,
    regexp_replace(trim(s), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g') as clean,
    split_part(regexp_replace(trim(s), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'), '-', 1)::int as g_games,
    split_part(regexp_replace(trim(s), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'), '-', 2)::int as opp_games
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva,
  unnest(string_to_array(score, ',')) as s
  WHERE outcome = 'runner - up'
)
SELECT date, tournament, opponent, score,
       sum(g_games) AS galina_games,
       sum(opp_games) AS opponent_games,
       sum(g_games) - sum(opp_games) AS game_difference
FROM per_set
GROUP BY date, tournament, opponent, score
ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date":"28 january 2003","galina_games":14,"game_difference":-2,"opponent":"matea mezak","opponent_games":16,"score":"6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6","tournament":"tipton"},{"date":"3 october 2003","galina_games":7,"game_difference":-5,"opponent":"roberta vinci","opponent_games":12,"score":"3 - 6 , 4 - 6","tournament":"latina"},{"date":"8 november 2005","galina_games":10,"game_difference":-3,"opponent":"lilia osterloh","opponent_games":13,"score":"6 - 7 , 4 - 6","tournament":"pittsburgh"}]

4) Compute the overall average game margin in those losses
SQL executed:
WITH per_set AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    trim(s) as setscore,
    split_part(regexp_replace(trim(s), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'), '-', 1)::int as g_games,
    split_part(regexp_replace(trim(s), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'), '-', 2)::int as opp_games
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva,
  unnest(string_to_array(score, ',')) as s
  WHERE outcome = 'runner - up'
), per_match AS (
  SELECT date,
         sum(g_games) AS galina_games,
         sum(opp_games) AS opponent_games,
         sum(games) - sum(opp_games) AS game_difference
  FROM (
    SELECT date, g_games as games, opp_games FROM per_set
  ) t
  GROUP BY date
)
SELECT avg(game_difference::numeric) AS average_game_difference FROM per_match;
Result:
[{"average_game_difference":-3.3333333333333333}]

Conclusion
- In this dataset (her runner-up results), Galina Voskoboeva’s average losing margin is about 3.33 games, not exactly 4. If “point” is intended to mean “games,” the claim is close in magnitude but imprecise.

Verdict: Partly Verified

Assumptions and scope
- “Point” was interpreted as “games” because the dataset does not include point-by-point totals, only set scores.
- “On average” was computed across the losses present in the public.galina_voskoboeva table (three runner-up matches). This table does not cover her entire career; findings are limited to the available rows.
- Scores are assumed to be from Voskoboeva’s perspective (first number each set is hers), which aligns with the outcomes displayed.
