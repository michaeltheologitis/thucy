Summary
- Claim: “Galina Voskoboeva have an equal winrate between both clay and hard court.”
- Finding: Not supported by the available data. In the dataset, her win rate differs between clay and hard surfaces.

Evidence from data
1) Inspect available outcomes and surfaces
Executed SQL:
SELECT outcome, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY outcome
ORDER BY count DESC, outcome;

Result:
- runner - up — 3
- winner — 2

Executed SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY surface
ORDER BY count DESC NULLS LAST, surface;

Result:
- clay — 2
- hard (i) — 2
- hard — 1

2) Compute win rate by normalized surface category (hard includes “hard” and “hard (i)”) 
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  CASE WHEN lower(surface) IN ('hard','hard (i)') THEN 'hard'
       WHEN lower(surface) = 'clay' THEN 'clay'
       ELSE surface END AS surface_category,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE outcome = 'winner') AS wins,
  COUNT(*) AS total,
  (COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE outcome = 'winner'))::float / COUNT(*) AS win_rate
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY CASE WHEN lower(surface) IN ('hard','hard (i)') THEN 'hard'
              WHEN lower(surface) = 'clay' THEN 'clay'
              ELSE surface END
ORDER BY surface_category;

Result:
- clay: wins = 1, total = 2, win_rate = 0.5
- hard: wins = 1, total = 3, win_rate = 0.3333333333333333

Conclusion
- The calculated win rates are 50% (clay) vs ~33.33% (hard). These are not equal. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The only available authoritative source in the connected data environment is the table public.galina_voskoboeva. It contains tournament outcomes with fields: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score.
- “Winrate” was interpreted as the proportion of entries labeled “winner” among all entries on a surface in this table (since match-level win/loss data are not available here). 
- “Hard (i)” (indoor hard) and “hard” were treated as the same “hard” category for comparison with “clay.”
