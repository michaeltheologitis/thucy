Claim to verify: “Rio Ave’s head coach is Carlos Brito and Sporting CP have José Peseiro.”

Data discovery and schema grounding
- Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact connector), public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga with columns: club (text), head coach (text), city (text), stadium (text), 2003 - 2004 season (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Quick scan to confirm stored club/head coach names:
SQL:
SELECT club, "head coach" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga LIMIT 20;
Excerpt of returned rows included (as provided by the tool): {"club":"sporting cp","head coach":"josé peseiro"}, {"club":"rio ave","head coach":"carlos brito"}

2) Direct retrieval for the two clubs (case-insensitive match used by the tool):
SQL:
SELECT club, "head coach" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE LOWER(club) IN ('rio ave','sporting cp');
Returned rows:
[{"club":"sporting cp","head coach":"josé peseiro"}, {"club":"rio ave","head coach":"carlos brito"}]

Assessment
- Rio Ave — head coach: Carlos Brito. Supported by row: {club: rio ave, head coach: carlos brito}.
- Sporting CP — head coach: José Peseiro. Supported by row: {club: sporting cp, head coach: josé peseiro}.

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the 2004–05 Primeira Liga table.

Assumptions
- The verification is grounded in the public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga dataset, which appears to reflect the 2004–05 season. The claim is therefore verified for that season.
- Club name matching is case-insensitive, as club names are stored in lowercase in the table.
