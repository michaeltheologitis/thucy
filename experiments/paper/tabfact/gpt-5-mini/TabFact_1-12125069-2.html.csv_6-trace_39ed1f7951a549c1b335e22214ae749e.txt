Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there exists a game where the winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt and the losing pitcher was Brandon Backe.

Data discovery and grounding
- Available data sources (tool: discover_data_sources): A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.
- Relevant table (tool: schema_query): t_2005_texas_rangers_season, which includes columns: date, winning team, score, winning pitcher, losing pitcher, attendance, location.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Exact match (case-sensitive) for both pitchers in the same game
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE "winning pitcher" = 'Roy Oswalt' AND "losing pitcher" = 'Brandon Backe';
Result:
match_count = 0

2) Case-insensitive exact match for both pitchers in the same game
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE lower("winning pitcher") = lower('Roy Oswalt')
  AND lower("losing pitcher") = lower('Brandon Backe');
Result:
match_count = 0

3) Case-insensitive substring match for both pitchers in the same game
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE lower("winning pitcher") LIKE '%oswalt%'
  AND lower("losing pitcher") LIKE '%backe%';
Result:
match_count = 0

4) Context check showing that each pitcher appears in the table (but not together as winner/loser in the same game)
SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", location
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE "winning pitcher" ILIKE '%oswalt%'
   OR "losing pitcher" ILIKE '%backe%';
Results (sample rows returned by the tool):
- date: may 20; winning team: texas; score: 7 - 3; winning pitcher: kenny rogers; losing pitcher: brandon backe; location: arlington
- date: june 24; winning team: houston; score: 5 - 2; winning pitcher: roy oswalt; losing pitcher: ricardo rodríguez; location: houston
- date: june 25; winning team: texas; score: 6 - 5; winning pitcher: chris young; losing pitcher: brandon backe; location: houston

Conclusion
- Within the available authoritative dataset (2005 Texas Rangers season game log), there are zero games where the winning pitcher is Roy Oswalt and the losing pitcher is Brandon Backe. The claim is not supported by the evidence in this data.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope is limited to the accessible table t_2005_texas_rangers_season. Other seasons/teams are not present in the available data. The verdict reflects what this dataset supports.
