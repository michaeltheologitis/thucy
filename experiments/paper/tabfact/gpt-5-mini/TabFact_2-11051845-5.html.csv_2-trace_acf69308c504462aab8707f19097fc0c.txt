Summary
The available NGC dataset (objects numbered 5001–6000) contains exactly two entries whose object type includes “irregular,” both labeled “irregular galaxy.” Therefore, the claim that irregular galaxies have 2 NGC numbers in the list is supported for this dataset.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14)
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  - Columns: ngc number (bigint), object type (text), constellation (text), right ascension ( j2000 ) (text), declination ( j2000 ) (text), apparent magnitude (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count entries classified as irregular galaxies
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count_irregular FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%irregular%';
- Result:
  count_irregular = 2

2) List the NGC numbers and raw object type for those entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type" FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%irregular%' ORDER BY "ngc number";
- Results:
  • NGC 5408 — object type: irregular galaxy
  • NGC 5477 — object type: irregular galaxy

Conclusion
- The table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 contains exactly two entries classified as “irregular galaxy,” supporting the claim for this list.

Assumptions
- “the list” refers to the available table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (NGC objects 5001–6000) discovered via the tools.
- “irregular galaxy” was identified via a case-insensitive search for the substring “irregular” in the object type field.
