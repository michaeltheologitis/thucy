Claim interpreted: There is no record for a player named “Calvin O’Neal” with a draft round larger than 6 (i.e., no such entry exists with round > 6 and an overall pick value).

Data source discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history (columns: round, pick, overall, name, position, college)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate entries for the player name normalized to “calvinoneal” (remove punctuation and compare lowercase), then inspect round and overall values.
Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(regexp_replace(name, '[^a-z]', '', 'g')) = 'calvinoneal';
Result:
[ { "round": 6, "pick": 24, "overall": 163, "name": "calvin o'neal", "position": "linebacker", "college": "michigan" } ]
Interpretation: One matching row exists, and it has round = 6 (not greater than 6), with overall = 163 present.

2) Count how many such entries have round > 6.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_round_gt_6 FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(regexp_replace(name, '[^a-z]', '', 'g')) = 'calvinoneal' AND round > 6;
Result:
[ { "count_round_gt_6": 0 } ]
Interpretation: No entries exist for “Calvin O’Neal” with round greater than 6.

Conclusion: The data show no record for Calvin O’Neal with a draft round larger than 6. The only matching entry is round 6, overall pick 163. Therefore, the claim (as interpreted) is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “total overall” refers to the overall draft pick field (overall) present in the draft-history table, and the core assertion is about the non-existence of any Calvin O’Neal entry with round > 6.
- Name matching was normalized by removing punctuation and comparing lowercase to capture variations like O’Neal/ONeal/O'Neal.
