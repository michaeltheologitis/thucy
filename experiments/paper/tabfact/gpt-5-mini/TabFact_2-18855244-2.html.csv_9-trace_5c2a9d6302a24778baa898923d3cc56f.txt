Summary conclusion: The claim “none of the athlete receive medal in gymnastics” is contradicted by the available data. In the authoritative TabFact (public schema) database, the table public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists contains multiple entries for gymnasts with clearly positive medal counts.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists with columns: "medal count" (bigint), date (text), athlete (text), nation (text), sport (text), "record medal event" (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Count how many athletes are listed under gymnastics
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS gym_athlete_count
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE sport ILIKE '%gym%';
- Result: gym_athlete_count = 3

2) Example rows for gymnastics
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "medal count", date, athlete, nation, sport, "record medal event"
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE sport ILIKE '%gym%'
  ORDER BY athlete
  LIMIT 10;
- Sample returned rows:
  - 3, 9 april 1896, carl schuhmann, germany, gymnastics, vault g
  - 3, 9 april 1896, hermann weingärtner, germany, gymnastics, vault b
  - 4, 9 april 1896, hermann weingärtner, germany, gymnastics, pommel horse s
  - 5, 9 april 1896, hermann weingärtner, germany, gymnastics, rings s
  - 6, 9 april 1896, hermann weingärtner, germany, gymnastics, horizontal bar g
  - 13, 21 october 1964, larisa latynina, soviet union, gymnastics, team g
  - 14, 21 october 1964, larisa latynina, soviet union, gymnastics, all - around s
  - 15, 22 october 1964, larisa latynina, soviet union, gymnastics, vault s
  - 16, 22 october 1964, larisa latynina, soviet union, gymnastics, uneven bars b
  - 17, 23 october 1964, larisa latynina, soviet union, gymnastics, balance beam b

3) Medal count range and athlete medal counts for gymnastics
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("medal count") AS min_medals, MAX("medal count") AS max_medals
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE sport ILIKE '%gym%';
- Result: min_medals = 3, max_medals = 18

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT athlete, "medal count"
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE sport ILIKE '%gym%'
  ORDER BY "medal count" DESC, athlete;
- Returned pairs (athlete — medal count):
  - larisa latynina — 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13
  - hermann weingärtner — 6, 5, 4, 3
  - carl schuhmann — 3

Interpretation:
- The table is specifically about athletes with multiple Olympic medals. It contains several gymnasts with positive medal counts (e.g., Larisa Latynina with up to 18 medals). Therefore, the claim that no athlete received a medal in gymnastics is directly contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim in the context of Olympic sports, since the authoritative table available is a list of multiple Olympic medalists. The sport filter used was sport ILIKE '%gym%' to capture “gymnastics” entries.
- While this table covers only multiple medalists, the presence of any gymnasts with medals is sufficient to refute the universal claim that none received medals.
