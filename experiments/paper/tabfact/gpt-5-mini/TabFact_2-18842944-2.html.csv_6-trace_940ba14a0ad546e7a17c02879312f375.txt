Claim to verify: "the largest attendance of 44505 be at the game that take place on september 13 , 1976"

Data source discovery:
- Connected database: TabFact Postgres (postgres_tabfact34)
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season

Schema context:
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence:
1) Inspect all games (to understand dates and attendance values)
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season ORDER BY week;
Key rows observed:
- week 1 — date: "september 13 , 1976" — opponent: "miami dolphins" — result: "l 30 - 21" — attendance: 77683
- week 3 — date: "september 26 , 1976" — opponent: "tampa bay buccaneers" — result: "w 14 - 9" — attendance: 44505
(among other rows)

2) What is the maximum attendance in the table?
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Result:
- max_attendance = 77683

3) Which game(s) had attendance 44505?
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE attendance = 44505;
Result:
- week: 3 — date: "september 26 , 1976" — opponent: "tampa bay buccaneers" — result: "w 14 - 9" — attendance: 44505

4) What was the attendance on september 13 , 1976?
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season
WHERE translate(lower(date), ' ,', '') = translate(lower('september 13 , 1976'), ' ,', '');
Result:
- week: 1 — date: "september 13 , 1976" — opponent: "miami dolphins" — result: "l 30 - 21" — attendance: 77683

Assessment:
- The largest attendance in this dataset is 77,683, not 44,505.
- The game with 44,505 attendance occurred on September 26, 1976, not on September 13, 1976.
- The game on September 13, 1976 had attendance 77,683.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1976 Buffalo Bills season games contained in public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season.
