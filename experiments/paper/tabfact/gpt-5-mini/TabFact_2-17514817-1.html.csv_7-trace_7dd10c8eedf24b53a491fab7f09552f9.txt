Claim to verify
“West Berkshire Brewery’s Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal every single time it won a prize between 1995 and 2009.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (Postgres), public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.west_berkshire_brewery (columns: year, “beer name”, prize, category, competition).

Schema evidence
- Tool: Schema inspection
Answer: Table west_berkshire_brewery with columns year (bigint), “beer name” (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text).

Evidence queries and results
1) Identify exact beer name variants present 1995–2009
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "beer name" FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 AND lower("beer name") LIKE '%magg%' ORDER BY "beer name";
Result:
- maggs magnificent mild

2) List all prize-winning records for the beer in 1995–2009
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, category, prize, "beer name" FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE "beer name" = 'maggs magnificent mild' AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 ORDER BY year;
Results (year — competition — category — prize):
- 2002 — siba south east region beer competition — mild and porter — gold medal
- 2003 — siba national beer competition — mild and porter — gold medal
- 2004 — bracknell blues and real ale festival — beer of the festival — overall winner
- 2005 — camra reading branch beer festival — mild — gold medal
- 2005 — camra reading branch beer festival — overall — third place
- 2005 — siba south east region beer competition — mild — gold medal
- 2005 — siba south east region beer competition — overall — bronze medal
- 2006 — siba national beer competition — mild — silver medal
- 2006 — camra reading branch beer festival — mild — silver medal
- 2008 — camra reading branch beer festival — in category — silver medal

3) Summarize prize outcomes (counts) for 1995–2009
SQL:
SELECT prize, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE "beer name" ILIKE '%magg%' AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 GROUP BY prize ORDER BY count DESC, prize;
Results:
- gold medal: 4
- silver medal: 3
- bronze medal: 1
- overall winner: 1
- third place: 1

Assessment
- The beer did win multiple gold medals in the period. However, it also won silver medals (2006, 2008), a bronze medal (2005), and other non-gold awards (“overall winner” in 2004 and “third place” in 2005). Therefore, it is not true that every prize it won between 1995 and 2009 was a gold medal.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the west_berkshire_brewery table.

Assumptions
- Year range interpreted as inclusive (1995–2009).
- “Overall winner” and “third place” are treated as prize outcomes distinct from a “gold medal.”
- The beer name stored in the database is “maggs magnificent mild” (no apostrophe); queries matched this exact form for the detailed listing and a case-insensitive pattern for counts.
