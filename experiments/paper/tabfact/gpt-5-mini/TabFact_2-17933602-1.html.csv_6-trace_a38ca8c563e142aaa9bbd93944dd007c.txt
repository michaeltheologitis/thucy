Claim interpreted: In the 2003–2004 Primeira Liga, the team that finished 15th played at Estádio do Restelo, while the team that finished 2nd played at Estádio Cidade de Coimbra.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga (columns: club, head coach, city, stadium, 2003 - 2004 season)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect how placements are recorded in the season column
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga;
Key distinct values (truncated):
- 1st in the liga; 2nd in the liga; 3rd in the liga; … 15th in the liga; …

2) Identify the club and stadium for 15th place in 2003–2004
SQL:
SELECT club, stadium FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" = '15th in the liga';
Result:
- club: belenenses
- stadium: estádio do restelo
Finding: The 15th-placed team was Belenenses, and their stadium is Estádio do Restelo. This supports the first part of the claim.

3) Identify the club and stadium for 2nd place in 2003–2004
SQL:
SELECT club, stadium FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" = '2nd in the liga';
Result:
- club: benfica
- stadium: estádio da luz
Finding: The 2nd-placed team was Benfica, whose stadium is Estádio da Luz—not Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. This contradicts the second part of the claim.

4) Confirm which club uses Estádio Cidade de Coimbra and their 2003–2004 placement
SQL:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season", stadium FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Coimbra%';
Result:
- club: académica de coimbra
- 2003 - 2004 season: 13th in the liga
- stadium: estádio cidade de coimbra
Finding: Estádio Cidade de Coimbra corresponds to Académica de Coimbra, who finished 13th, not 2nd.

Conclusion:
- True: The 15th-placed team (Belenenses) played at Estádio do Restelo.
- False: The 2nd-placed team did not play at Estádio Cidade de Coimbra; it was Benfica at Estádio da Luz.

Assumptions made:
- “15th/2nd in the liga of the 2003–2004 season” refers to the entries whose "2003 - 2004 season" column is exactly '15th in the liga' and '2nd in the liga' in the provided table.
- “be in/held in [stadium]” refers to the club’s home stadium as recorded in the table’s 'stadium' column.
