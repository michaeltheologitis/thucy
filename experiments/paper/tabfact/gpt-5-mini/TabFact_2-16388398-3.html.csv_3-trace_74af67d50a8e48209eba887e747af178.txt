Summary
- I explored the available TabFact PostgreSQL data source and inspected the public schema, which contains a table relevant to AFL pre-season matches: public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup. This table includes columns for home/away teams, scores, ground, crowd, and date.
- I queried this table to verify whether, on “sunday , 30 january” with a crowd of 12,239, the away team scored 17.5.

Findings vs Claim
- Date and crowd: A match exists on “sunday , 30 january” with crowd = 12239.
- Score attribution: In that match, the home team scored 17.5 (107), while the away team scored 19.11 (125). Therefore, the statement that the away team scored 17.5 is incorrect.

Executed SQL (evidence) and results
1) Direct test for an exact match on away team score = '17.5', crowd, and date
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup
WHERE "away team score" = '17.5' AND crowd = 12239 AND date ILIKE '%30%' AND date ILIKE '%January%';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Identify the row for the specified crowd and date to inspect actual scores
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup
WHERE crowd = 12239 AND date ILIKE '%30 January%';
Result (one row):
{ "home team": "adelaide", "home team score": "17.5 (107)", "away team": "melbourne", "away team score": "19.11 (125)", "ground": "football park", "crowd": 12239, "date": "sunday , 30 january" }

3) Check if away team score contains '17.5' as a substring (e.g., '17.5 (107)')
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup
WHERE "away team score" ILIKE '%17.5%' AND crowd = 12239 AND date ILIKE '%30 January%';
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- The claim is partly inaccurate: while the date and crowd match a real record, the score of 17.5 belongs to the home team (Adelaide), not the away team (Melbourne).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “sunday , 30 january” as a textual date and matched via case-insensitive substring on the date column.
- Because scores are stored as text (e.g., "17.5 (107)"), I checked both exact equality and substring presence for '17.5' in the away team score.
