Claim to verify: “the competition type be a junior championship 2 time.”

Data discovery and scope:
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.luk_melich with columns: year (bigint), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text).

Schema confirmation:
- Table public.luk_melich exists with the above columns; no keys or constraints.

Evidence 1: Distinct competition values and their frequencies
- SQL executed:
  SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.luk_melich
  GROUP BY competition
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, competition ASC;
- Result (excerpt):
  - world championships — 3
  - olympic games — 2
  - european championships — 1
  - european junior championships — 1
  - european u23 championships — 1
  - universiade — 1
  - world junior championships — 1
- Interpretation: Competitions that explicitly include “junior” are “world junior championships” (1) and “european junior championships” (1).

Evidence 2: Count rows where competition contains “junior”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS junior_count
  FROM public.luk_melich
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%junior%';
- Result: junior_count = 2

Evidence 3: List the junior competition rows
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes
  FROM public.luk_melich
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%junior%'
  ORDER BY year;
- Results:
  1) 1998 — world junior championships — annecy , france — 10th — 61.51 m
  2) 1999 — european junior championships — riga , latvia — 5th — 64.20 m

Conclusion:
- Within the public.luk_melich dataset, competitions classified as “junior championships” (i.e., competition names containing “junior”) appear exactly 2 times. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Junior championship” is interpreted as any competition whose name includes the word “junior” (case-insensitive) in the competition column.
- Verification is limited to the public.luk_melich table in the TabFact database, treated as the authoritative scope for this claim.
