Summary
I verified whether the Zakspeed 861 chassis is associated with the years 1986 and 1987 by querying the authoritative TabFact database. The data shows that the Zakspeed 861 appears for 1986 and is also listed alongside the 871 for 1987, indicating it was in use across both seasons.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named zakspeed (columns: year, chassis, engine (s), tyres, points).

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Table public.zakspeed(year bigint, chassis text, "engine (s)" text, tyres text, points bigint)

Evidence 1: Direct filter for chassis containing "861"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, chassis FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis LIKE '%861%';
- Results:
  - 1986, zakspeed 861
  - 1987, zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871

Evidence 2: Full rows for 1986 and 1987
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year IN (1986, 1987) ORDER BY year;
- Results:
  - year: 1986; chassis: zakspeed 861; engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c; tyres: g; points: 0
  - year: 1987; chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871; engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c; tyres: g; points: 2

Evidence 3: Distinct years where chassis mentions "zakspeed 861"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.zakspeed WHERE lower(chassis) LIKE '%zakspeed 861%' ORDER BY year;
- Results:
  - 1986
  - 1987

Conclusion
The data shows the Zakspeed 861 is associated with both 1986 and 1987. Therefore, the claim that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was made/used in 1986 and 1987 is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- I interpret "be make" as referring to the chassis being in use/part of the team's chassis lineup for those seasons, as indicated by the "chassis" field in the dataset. The dataset records usage by season rather than explicit manufacturing dates.
