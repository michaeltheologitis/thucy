Conclusion: Verified. In the available long jump dataset, the majority of athletes associated with the longest marks are from the United States (6 out of 10 = 60%).

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.long_jump (columns: mark [text], wind [double precision], athlete [text], nationality [text], venue [text], date [text])

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Total number of rows (size of the list of longest marks)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.long_jump;
Result:
- total_rows = 10

2) Distribution by nationality (row-level)
SQL:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.long_jump
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY cnt DESC, nationality;
Results:
- united states: 6
- cuba: 1
- greece: 1
- panama: 1
- soviet union: 1
Interpretation: United States accounts for 6/10 entries = 60% (a majority).

3) Distinct athletes by nationality (to ensure counts aren’t inflated by repeated athletes)
SQL:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athlete_count
FROM public.long_jump
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY distinct_athlete_count DESC, nationality;
Results:
- united states: 6
- cuba: 1
- greece: 1
- panama: 1
- soviet union: 1
Additional check — total distinct athletes:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS total_distinct_athletes
FROM public.long_jump;
Result:
- total_distinct_athletes = 10
Interpretation: Even counting unique athletes, the U.S. still represents 6/10 = 60% (a majority).

4) Confirmation the table lists top marks (descending by numeric meters) and their nationalities
Plan step 1 (inspect mark format):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT mark FROM public.long_jump ORDER BY mark LIMIT 200;

Main ordering query:
SQL:
SELECT athlete, nationality, mark,
  CASE
    WHEN (regexp_match(mark, '^[0-9]+[\.,]?[0-9]*'))[1] IS NOT NULL
    THEN CAST(replace((regexp_match(mark, '^[0-9]+[\.,]?[0-9]*'))[1], ',', '.') AS numeric)
    ELSE NULL
  END AS mark_m
FROM public.long_jump
ORDER BY mark_m DESC NULLS LAST;
Results (athlete | nationality | mark_m):
1) mike powell | united states | 8.95
2) bob beamon | united states | 8.90
3) carl lewis | united states | 8.87
4) robert emmiyan | soviet union | 8.86
5) larry myricks | united states | 8.74
6) erick walder | united states | 8.74
7) dwight phillips | united states | 8.74
8) irving saladino | panama | 8.73
9) iván pedroso | cuba | 8.71
10) loúis tsátoumas | greece | 8.66
Interpretation: Of these top marks, 6 of the 10 athletes are from the United States.

Final assessment
- The dataset shows that the majority of athletes listed among the longest long jump marks are from the United States (6 out of 10 entries and 6 out of 10 unique athletes).

Assumptions
- “Athletes with the longest mark” is interpreted as the athletes listed in the public.long_jump table, which appears to represent the top all-time long jump marks.
- Nationality comparisons are performed as stored (lowercase strings like “united states”).
- Marks were ordered by extracting the leading numeric meters value from the mark text for confirmation purposes.
