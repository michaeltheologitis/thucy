Claim to verify: "there be 2.4 block per game during the season where the field goal percentage be 594 (2nd)"

What I checked
- I looked for any season entry where the field goal percentage is recorded as "594 (2nd)" (interpreted as 59.4% with a 2nd-place rank) and verified the corresponding blocks per game value.

Evidence from the data
- Matching record found shows blocks per game = 2.4 for the season where field goal percentage is listed as "594 (2nd)".

Executed SQL and results
1) Query:
SELECT selection, season, "field goal percentage", "blocks per game"
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
WHERE "field goal percentage" IN ('594 (2nd)', '59.4 (2nd)');

Result:
[{"selection":5, "season":"2010 - 11 (1 / 2)", "field goal percentage":"594 (2nd)", "blocks per game":2.4}]

2) Confirmation query (pattern match to cover both formats 59.4 and 594):
SELECT selection, season, "field goal percentage", "blocks per game"
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
WHERE "field goal percentage" ILIKE '%59.4%' OR "field goal percentage" ILIKE '%594%';

Result:
[{"selection":5, "season":"2010 - 11 (1 / 2)", "field goal percentage":"594 (2nd)", "blocks per game":2.4}]

Conclusion
- The data shows a season entry with field goal percentage "594 (2nd)" where blocks per game equals 2.4, which directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "594 (2nd)" is interpreted as 59.4% ranked 2nd.
- The claim refers to the Dwight Howard data available in this dataset; the season label "2010 - 11 (1 / 2)" is treated as the relevant season entry.
