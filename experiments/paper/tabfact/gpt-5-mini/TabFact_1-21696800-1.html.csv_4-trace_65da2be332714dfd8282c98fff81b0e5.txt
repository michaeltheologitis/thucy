Claim to verify: “episode 4 be see by 2.24 million people in the US.”

Finding: In the available dataset (Smallville, Season 9), Episode 4 (“Echo”) had 2.61 million US viewers—not 2.24 million. The 2.24 million figure corresponds to Episode 2 (“Metallo”). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in this environment.

Evidence grounded in data (with exact executed SQL):

1) Data source exploration
- SQL:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
ORDER BY table_name;
Result: smallville_season_9

- SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default, ordinal_position
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
ORDER BY table_name, ordinal_position;
Key columns for this task (table smallville_season_9):
  - "-" (bigint) [season-episode number]
  - "no" (bigint) [overall episode number]
  - "title" (text)
  - "us viewers (million)" (double precision)

2) Identify Episode 4 (season-episode number) and its US viewers
- SQL:
SELECT "-", "no", "title", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "-" = 4;
Returned row:
{"-": 4, "no": 178, "title": "echo", "us viewers (million)": 2.61}
Interpretation: Season 9, Episode 4 (“Echo”) had 2.61 million US viewers.

3) Cross-check the 2.24 million figure
- SQL:
SELECT "-", title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "-" = 2 OR "us viewers (million)" = 2.24 ORDER BY "-";
Returned row:
{"-": 2, "title": "metallo", "us viewers (million)": 2.24}
Interpretation: The 2.24 million figure matches Episode 2 (“Metallo”), not Episode 4.

(Additional context query used during review)
- SQL:
SELECT "no", "title", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 ORDER BY "no" LIMIT 50;
Excerpt of returned rows:
{"no":175,"title":"savior","us viewers (million)":2.58}, {"no":176,"title":"metallo","us viewers (million)":2.24}, {"no":177,"title":"rabid","us viewers (million)":2.3}, {"no":178,"title":"echo","us viewers (million)":2.61}, ...

Conclusion: The data shows Episode 4 had 2.61 million US viewers. The claim that Episode 4 was seen by 2.24 million people in the US is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the only available dataset in this environment: Smallville Season 9. Here, “episode 4” is interpreted as the season-episode number (column "-") in public.smallville_season_9.
