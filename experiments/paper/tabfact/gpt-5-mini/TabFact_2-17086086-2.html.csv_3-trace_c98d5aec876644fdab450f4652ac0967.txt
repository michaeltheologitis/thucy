Claim to verify: On 9 July 1990, the opponent in the final was Katerina Maleeva.

Data source discovery
- Database: postgres_tabfact19
- Schema: public
- Table: isabel_cueto
  - Columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent in the final (text), score (text)

Evidence
1) Check the entry for date = 9 July 1990
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", score
  FROM public.isabel_cueto
  WHERE lower(date) = lower('9 July 1990');
- Result: tournament = "palermo , italy"; surface = "clay"; opponent in the final = "barbara paulus"; score = "6 - 2 , 6 - 3"
- Interpretation: On 9 July 1990, the opponent in the final recorded in this dataset was Barbara Paulus, not Katerina Maleeva.

2) Check whether Katerina Maleeva appears as an opponent in any final in this dataset
- Executed SQL (to see exact stored names):
  SELECT DISTINCT "opponent in the final" FROM public.isabel_cueto ORDER BY 1 LIMIT 200;
- Distinct opponents include: barbara paulus, katerina maleeva, laura golarsa, sandra cecchini

- Executed SQL (filter for Katerina Maleeva):
  SELECT date, tournament, surface, score FROM public.isabel_cueto WHERE "opponent in the final" = 'katerina maleeva';
- Result: date = "31 july 1989"; tournament = "sofia , bulgaria"; surface = "clay"; score = "6 - 2 , 7 - 6 (3)"
- Interpretation: Katerina Maleeva is listed as an opponent in the final on 31 July 1989, not on 9 July 1990.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that on 9 July 1990, the opponent in the final was Barbara Paulus. Katerina Maleeva appears as an opponent in a final on 31 July 1989. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the information recorded in the available isabel_cueto table and uses the date formatting as stored (text).
