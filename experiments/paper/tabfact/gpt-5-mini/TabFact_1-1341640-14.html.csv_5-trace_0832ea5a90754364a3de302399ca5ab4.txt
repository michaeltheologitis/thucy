Claim to verify: “In 1974 Republican Phil Crane beat Henry Hyde, who was a Democrat.”

What the data contains
- Available data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL) with a single election-related table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980.
- Table columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (bigint), result (text), candidates (text). No state column, no primary key.

Evidence gathered
1) Locate entries for Phil Crane and Henry Hyde in the 1980 House data and review their party affiliation and “first elected” year.

Executed SQL:
SELECT district, party, incumbent, candidates, result, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Phil Crane%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Henry Hyde%';

Results (verbatim from the database):
- Row 1
  • district: illinois 6
  • party: republican
  • incumbent: henry hyde
  • candidates: henry hyde (r) 67.0% mario reymond reda (d) 33.0%
  • result: re - elected
  • first elected: 1974

- Row 2
  • district: illinois 12
  • party: republican
  • incumbent: phil crane
  • candidates: phil crane (r) 74.1% david mccartney (d) 25.9%
  • result: re - elected
  • first elected: 1969

Findings from the data
- Henry Hyde is listed as a Republican (party: republican) and his “first elected” year is 1974. This directly contradicts the claim that Hyde “was a Democrat,” and indicates he won his first House election in 1974 rather than being beaten that year.
- Phil Crane is listed as a Republican and an incumbent in a different Illinois district in 1980. The data shows both men as Republicans serving separate Illinois districts; it provides no evidence that they ran against each other in 1974. The “first elected: 1974” for Hyde implies he won in 1974, which is inconsistent with the assertion that Crane beat him that year.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate. The available data contradicts the statement that Henry Hyde was a Democrat and indicates he was first elected in 1974 as a Republican, not defeated by Phil Crane.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a U.S. House election. The available dataset covers 1980 results but includes a “first elected” field, which we used to infer Hyde’s 1974 outcome. No 1974 table was available in the connected data; conclusions are based on the 1980 table’s attributes and content.
