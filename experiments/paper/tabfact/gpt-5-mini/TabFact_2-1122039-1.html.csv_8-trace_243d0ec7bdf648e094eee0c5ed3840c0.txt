Summary conclusion: In the available dataset (t_1950_swiss_grand_prix), there are exactly two entries where the entrant is “private,” but the associated drivers are Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin—not Harry Schell and Johnny Claes. For Harry Schell and Johnny Claes, the entrants are “Ecurie Bleue” and “Ecurie Belge,” respectively. Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Discovered table: t_1950_swiss_grand_prix(driver text, entrant text, constructor text, chassis text, engine text, tyre text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify rows with private entrants and list them
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant ILIKE '%private%';
Results:
- {driver: "toni branca", entrant: "private", constructor: "maserati", chassis: "maserati 4cl", engine: "maserati l4s", tyre: "p"}
- {driver: "philippe étancelin", entrant: "private", constructor: "talbot - lago", chassis: "talbot - lago t26c", engine: "talbot l6", tyre: "d"}

2) Count of private entrant rows
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS private_count FROM t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant ILIKE '%private%';
Result:
- private_count: 2

3) Check entrant values for Harry Schell and Johnny Claes
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, entrant FROM t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE lower(driver) IN ('harry schell','johnny claes');
Results:
- driver: johnny claes — entrant: ecurie belge
- driver: harry schell — entrant: ecurie bleue

Assessment of the claim:
- “entrant be private on 2 occasion”: Supported by the data (2 entries with entrant containing “private”).
- “with the driver be harry schell and johnny claes”: Contradicted by the data (the private entries correspond to Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin; Schell and Claes have entrants Ecurie Bleue and Ecurie Belge).

Assumptions:
- “private” was treated case-insensitively and matched via ILIKE '%private%' to capture any entrant values containing the word “private.”
- The claim is interpreted with respect to the available dataset for the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix (t_1950_swiss_grand_prix), as no other related tables were present in the accessible data source.
