Claim to verify: “Equestrian at the Asian Games happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: equestrian_at_the_asian_games (columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Distinct years recorded for equestrian at the Asian Games
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year;
Results:
1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010

2) Years between 1982 and 2010 (inclusive) where equestrian is recorded
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT year FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year BETWEEN 1982 AND 2010 ORDER BY year;
Results:
1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010

3) Check if 1990 is present
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_1990 FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year = 1990;
Result:
count_1990 = 0 (i.e., 1990 is not present)

4) Year-to-year gaps to assess a 4-year cadence
SQL:
WITH yrs AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year
)
SELECT year, lead(year) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS next_year,
       (lead(year) OVER (ORDER BY year) - year) AS gap
FROM yrs;
Results:
- 1982 → 1986: gap = 4
- 1986 → 1994: gap = 8
- 1994 → 1998: gap = 4
- 1998 → 2002: gap = 4
- 2002 → 2006: gap = 4
- 2006 → 2010: gap = 4

Assessment
- The table shows equestrian events at the Asian Games in 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.
- 1990 is missing (no recorded equestrian event), which creates the single 8-year gap from 1986 to 1994.
- Aside from the missing 1990 edition, entries follow a 4-year pattern across the 1982–2010 window.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data: equestrian occurred on a 4-year cadence from 1982 to 2010, with the exception that 1990 is not present.

Assumptions
- “Happen” is interpreted as “equestrian was contested/held at the Asian Games.”
- The equestrian_at_the_asian_games table is authoritative for which editions included equestrian within 1982–2010.
