Claim to verify: “7.2 be the rebound average when game be 125 and the rank be 7.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public and table public.my_info_table containing columns: rank, player, years, games, reb avg, total rebounds.

Evidence gathered:
- I queried public.my_info_table for records where games = 125 and rank = 7, returning player, years, games, reb avg, total rebounds.
- Result: One matching record found.
  - Player: jai lewis
  - Years: 2002 - 2006
  - Games: 125
  - Reb avg: 7.2
  - Total rebounds: 895

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE games = 125 AND rank = 7;

Assessment:
- The record with games = 125 and rank = 7 has a rebound average (reb avg) of 7.2. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “rebound average” maps to the column named “reb avg” in public.my_info_table.
- The claim refers to the dataset available (public.my_info_table) and to exact matches on games and rank.
