Claim to verify: “the yugoslavian national team fail to score only 1 time , drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results with columns [date, city, opponent, results, type of game]. This table records match-level results for the Yugoslavia national football team, including World Cup qualifiers (e.g., “1982 wcq”).

Step 1 — Inspect sample data to understand fields
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results LIMIT 10;
Result (7 rows present in table):
1) march 22 | sarajevo | uruguay | 2:1 | friendly
2) march 30 | belgrade | romania | 2:0 | balkan cup
3) april 26 | borovo | poland | 2:1 | friendly
4) august 27 | bucharest , romania | romania | 1:4 | balkan cup
5) september 10 | luxembourg | luxembourg | 5:0 | 1982 wcq
6) september 27 | ljubljana | denmark | 2:1 | 1982 wcq
7) november 15 | torino , italy | italy | 0:2 | 1982 wcq

Interpretation of fields:
- results appears to be stored as goals_for:goals_against from Yugoslavia’s perspective.
- “type of game” includes qualifiers such as “1982 wcq”.

Step 2 — Did Yugoslavia fail to score only one time (in this dataset)?
Executed SQL (robust parse of the results column):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_goals_count
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results LIKE '%:%'
  AND trim(split_part(results, ':', 1)) = '0';
Result:
- zero_goals_count = 1

Executed SQL to list the zero-goal match:
SELECT date, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results LIKE '%:%'
  AND trim(split_part(results, ':', 1)) = '0'
ORDER BY date;
Returned row:
- november 15 | italy | 0:2 | 1982 wcq

Finding:
- In the 7 recorded matches in this table, Yugoslavia failed to score exactly once, in a 1982 World Cup qualifier against Italy (0:2).

Step 3 — Check the Denmark World Cup qualifier result(s)
Executed SQL to find all Denmark matches:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Denmark%';
Result:
- september 27 | ljubljana | denmark | 2:1 | 1982 wcq

Executed SQL to test if Yugoslavia ever lost vs Denmark in these records (goals_for < goals_against):
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Denmark%'
  AND CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1)) AS integer) < CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2)) AS integer)
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- No rows returned (i.e., no loss to Denmark in these records).

Finding:
- The only Denmark match in this dataset is a 1982 World Cup qualifier in Ljubljana that Yugoslavia won 2:1. There is no evidence here of Yugoslavia “dropping” (losing) a World Cup qualifier 1–2 to Denmark.

Analysis vs. the claim
- “fail to score only 1 time”: Supported by the data in this table — there is exactly one match where Yugoslavia’s goals_for = 0 (0:2 vs Italy, 1982 WCQ). Note: this conclusion is limited to the seven matches present in this dataset.
- “drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark”: Contradicted by the data — the dataset shows Yugoslavia beat Denmark 2:1 in a 1982 World Cup qualifier; it does not show a 1:2 loss to Denmark.

Conclusion
- The dataset supports that, within the recorded matches, Yugoslavia failed to score exactly once — a 0:2 loss to Italy in a 1982 WCQ.
- The dataset contradicts the assertion that Yugoslavia “dropped” a World Cup qualifier 2:1 against Denmark; instead, they won 2:1 against Denmark in the listed 1982 WCQ.

Assumptions and scope notes
- All conclusions are strictly based on the available table (7 matches). Broader historical claims beyond these rows are outside the scope of this dataset.
- I interpret “2:1” in the results field as Yugoslavia’s goals first (goals_for:goals_against).
- I interpret “drop a world cup qualify match” as “lost a World Cup qualifying match.”
