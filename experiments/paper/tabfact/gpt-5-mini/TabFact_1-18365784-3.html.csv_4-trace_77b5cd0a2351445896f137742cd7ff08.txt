Summary
- The claim states that 18.27 is the arrival time of the train that departs at 18.16. I verified this against the available TabFact database, which contains a timetable-like table.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: departure (text), "going to" (text), "calling at" (text), arrival (double precision), operator (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Understand time formatting in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT departure, "going to", "calling at", arrival, operator FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 10;
- Observation: departure times are stored as text in HH.MM-like strings (e.g., "07.10", "10.25"), and arrival times are numeric (double precision) like 7.28, 11.3, 13, 12.08.

2) Verify the specific departure time 18.16 and its arrival time
- SQL:
  SELECT arrival, "going to" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE departure = '18.16';
- Result: One trip found; destination: spilsby; arrival: 18.27.

3) Full row for additional context
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE departure = '18.16';
- Result:
  - departure: 18.16
  - going to: spilsby
  - calling at: halton holegate , spilsby
  - arrival: 18.27
  - operator: gnr

Conclusion
- The data shows a single trip with departure 18.16 and arrival 18.27. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- I matched the departure time by exact text equality to '18.16' (the table stores times as text in HH.MM format). If there are entries with alternative formatting (e.g., '18:16' or with annotations), they were not included in this exact match.
- Times are interpreted in HH.MM notation consistent with the table’s storage and the claim’s format.
