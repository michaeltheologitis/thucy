Claim to verify:
- "on august 26 the attendance be 24343 and on august 27 the attendance be 2142"

Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL TabFact database, public schema
- Table: t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all August games to locate August 26 and August 27 entries:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Aug%' OR date ILIKE '%August%';

Key returned rows (subset of the full result relevant to the claim):
- august 26 | reds | 9 - 5 | martínez (1 - 1) | 48063 | 63 - 70
- august 27 | reds | 7 - 5 | remlinger (6 - 6) | 48032 | 64 - 70

Findings:
- August 26 attendance = 48,063 (not 24,343)
- August 27 attendance = 48,032 (not 2,142)

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are contradicted by the data in the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the dates present in the only available dataset (1997 Colorado Rockies season) and the “August 26/27” mentioned correspond to those entries. No other datasets or years were available in this environment.
