Claim to verify: “greg ostertag play the center position for the jazz from 1995 to 2004 and then from 2005 to 2006.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact9 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence collected
1) Retrieve Greg Ostertag’s roster entry
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE 'Greg Ostertag';
- Result:
  player: greg ostertag
  position: center
  years for jazz: 1995 - 2004 , 2005 - 06

2) Cross-check uniqueness and consistency for “Ostertag”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Result: count = 1

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Result: position = center

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Result: years for jazz = 1995 - 2004 , 2005 - 06

Assessment
- Position: The table lists Greg Ostertag’s position as “center,” matching the claim.
- Tenure with the Jazz: The table lists “1995 - 2004 , 2005 - 06,” which corresponds to two stints: 1995–2004 and 2005–2006, matching the claim’s time ranges.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data: Greg Ostertag is listed as center, with Jazz years 1995–2004 and 2005–06.

Assumptions
- Interpret “2005 - 06” as the 2005–2006 span (i.e., through the 2006 season/year).
- Case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) is appropriate for the player name.
