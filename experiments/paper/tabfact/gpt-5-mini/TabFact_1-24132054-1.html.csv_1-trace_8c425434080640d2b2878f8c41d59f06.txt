Claim: “Keith Gordon directed 2 episodes of Dexter in Season 3.”

Data source discovery:
- Connected to a PostgreSQL instance labeled “TabFact (postgres_tabfact5)”.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.dexter_season_3 with columns including “no in season”, “title”, and “directed by”.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Count how many Season 3 episodes list Keith Gordon as director
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%';
Result:
[{"count": 2}]

2) List the specific episodes
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "directed by", "original air date" FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%' ORDER BY "no in season";
Result:
[
  {"directed by": "keith gordon", "no in season": 1, "no in series": 25, "original air date": "september 28 , 2008", "title": "our father"},
  {"directed by": "keith gordon", "no in season": 4, "no in series": 28, "original air date": "october 19 , 2008", "title": "all in the family"}
]

Conclusion:
- The data shows Keith Gordon directed exactly 2 episodes of Dexter Season 3: Episode 1 (“Our Father”) and Episode 4 (“All in the Family”).

Assumptions:
- Used case-insensitive substring matching (ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%') to account for capitalization in the “directed by” field.
- The table public.dexter_season_3 corresponds to the TV series Dexter (Showtime) Season 3 episode listings.
