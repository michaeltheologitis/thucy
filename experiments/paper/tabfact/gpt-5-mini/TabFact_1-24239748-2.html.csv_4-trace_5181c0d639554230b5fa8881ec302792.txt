Data sources discovered

- Table: public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (text columns: county, exports (us mil), percent of total exports, imports (us mil), percent of total imports)

Key evidence from the data
1) Sud - Vest Oltenia record
- SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  WHERE lower(county) = lower('sud - vest oltenia');
- Result:
  county: sud - vest oltenia
  exports (us mil):  3226.2
  imports (us mil):  2007.8
  percent of total exports: 7.7 %
  percent of total imports: 3.0 %
- Interpretation: Exports for Sud - Vest Oltenia are 3226.2 (US million), not 26557.8.

  SELECT *
  FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  WHERE lower(county) = 'bucharest - ilfov';

  imports (us mil):  26557.8
