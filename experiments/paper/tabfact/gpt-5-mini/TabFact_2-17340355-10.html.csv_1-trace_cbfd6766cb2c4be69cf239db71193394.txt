Conclusion
- The highest attendance at the American Airlines Center (within the available dataset: 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season) is 20,301. This occurred on April 5 vs. Dallas.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify games at the American Airlines Center
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%american airlines center%';
Result:
[{"date":"april 5","game":77,"location attendance":"american airlines center 20301","team":"dallas"}]

2) Parse attendance from the location/attendance field (take the last whitespace-separated token and cast to int)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", ((regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '))[array_upper(regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '),1)])::int AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%american airlines center%';
Result:
[{"attendance":20301,"date":"april 5","game":77,"location attendance":"american airlines center 20301","team":"dallas"}]

3) Compute the maximum attendance among those rows
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(((regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '))[array_upper(regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '),1)])::int) AS max_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%american airlines center%';
Result:
[{"max_attendance":20301}]

4) List rows that match that maximum (for completeness)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", ((regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '))[array_upper(regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '),1)])::int AS attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%american airlines center%'
  AND ((regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '))[array_upper(regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '),1)])::int = (
    SELECT MAX(((regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '))[array_upper(regexp_split_to_array("location attendance", ' '),1)])::int)
    FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
    WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%american airlines center%'
  )
ORDER BY game;
Result:
[{"attendance":20301,"date":"april 5","game":77,"location attendance":"american airlines center 20301","team":"dallas"}]

Notes on scope and parsing
- Data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23), table public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.
- The "location attendance" field stores venue text followed by the attendance number; attendance was parsed as the last whitespace-separated token.
- Only one game in this dataset mentions "american airlines center", so the maximum equals that game’s attendance.

Assumptions
- The request is interpreted as “What is the highest attendance at the American Airlines Center in the available dataset?”
- Search was case-insensitive on the literal text "american airlines center".
- Attendance is recorded as the trailing numeric token in "location attendance".
