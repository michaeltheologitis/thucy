Summary conclusion: The claim that Bob Beamon has recently set his long jump record is not supported by the data. The available dataset records Bob Beamon’s long jump mark as being set on October 18, 1968 in Mexico City, which is not recent.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named long_jump.

Key evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Bob Beamon’s long jump entry
- Natural-language request: Show all long jump records by Bob Beamon, including mark, wind, venue, and date.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT mark, wind, venue, date, athlete FROM public.long_jump WHERE athlete ILIKE '%beamon%';
- Result:
  • athlete: bob beamon
    mark: 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a
    wind: 2
    venue: mexico city
    date: october 18 , 1968

2) Confirm there is only one relevant row mentioning Bob Beamon
- Natural-language request: Count how many long_jump rows mention Bob Beamon.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.long_jump WHERE (mark ILIKE '%Bob Beamon%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Bob Beamon%' OR nationality ILIKE '%Bob Beamon%' OR venue ILIKE '%Bob Beamon%' OR date ILIKE '%Bob Beamon%');
- Result: {"count": 1}

Interpretation:
- The single row for Bob Beamon documents his famous 8.90 m jump on October 18, 1968 in Mexico City. This directly contradicts the notion that he has “recently” set his long jump record.

Assumptions:
- “Recently” is interpreted as occurring in the near past (e.g., recent years or months). A record dated 1968 is not recent by any reasonable interpretation.
- Name matching used a case-insensitive search for “Bob Beamon.”
