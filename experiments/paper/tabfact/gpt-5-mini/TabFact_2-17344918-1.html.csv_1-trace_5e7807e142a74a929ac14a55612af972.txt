Claim interpreted: The user asserts that, in the year San Pedro was the winner, the 2nd leg score was 3 - 0.

Evidence from the data:
1) Rows where the 2nd leg equals 3 - 0
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "year", winner, aggregate, "1st leg", "2nd leg"
  FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
  WHERE "2nd leg" = '3 - 0';
- Results:
  • 1978 | federación misionera | 4 - 0 | 1 - 0 | 3 - 0
  • 1984 | san pedro            | 4 - 3 | 1 - 3 | 3 - 0

2) Row(s) where the winner is San Pedro
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "year", "winner", "aggregate", "1st leg", "2nd leg"
  FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
  WHERE "winner" ILIKE 'san pedro';
- Result:
  • 1984 | san pedro | 4 - 3 | 1 - 3 | 3 - 0

Assessment:
- In 1984, the winner is San Pedro and the 2nd leg score is 3 - 0. This directly supports the claim as interpreted.
- Note: There is another year (1978) with a 3 - 0 second leg, but the winner that year was federación misionera. This does not contradict the claim that in San Pedro’s winning year, the 2nd leg was 3 - 0.

Conclusion: The statement is supported by the data. The year in which San Pedro was the winner is 1984, and the 2nd leg score that year was 3 - 0.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- I interpreted the sentence to mean: “In the year San Pedro was the winner, the 2nd leg score was 3 - 0,” rather than a universal statement about all 3 - 0 second legs.
