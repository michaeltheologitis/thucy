Summary
- I discovered one available data source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public table named memorial_van_damme that appears to list Memorial Van Damme meet records by event, athlete, and record time/date.
- I inspected the table schema and then queried for entries relating to the 3000 m steeplechase and athlete names containing “Chemos”. The results directly support the claim.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.memorial_van_damme
- Columns: event (text), record (text), athlete (text), nationality (text), date (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Query to find the 3000 m steeplechase entry
SQL:
SELECT event, athlete, record FROM public.memorial_van_damme
WHERE lower(event) LIKE '%3000%' AND lower(event) LIKE '%steeplechase%';
Result:
- event: 3000 m steeplechase
- athlete: milcah chemos
- record: 9:15.06

2) Query to filter rows where athlete name contains 'Chemos' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT event, athlete, record FROM public.memorial_van_damme
WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Chemos%';
Result:
- event: 3000 m steeplechase
- athlete: milcah chemos
- record: 9:15.06

Assessment
- The data shows that Milcah Chemos is listed with a record of 9:15.06 for the 3000 m steeplechase in the Memorial Van Damme meet records table. This directly matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “Record” is interpreted as the Memorial Van Damme meet record, consistent with the table’s purpose.
- Case-insensitive matching was used to locate the event and athlete entries.
- If the claim intended a world record or personal best, that is outside the scope of this dataset; the verification here pertains to the Memorial Van Damme meet record as stored in the table.
