Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate season/game data for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild.
- Identified a single relevant table (t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season) containing game logs with home/visitor indicators.
- Counted how many rows list Minnesota as the home team versus the visitor to determine home vs away totals.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL source (postgres_tabfact6) with public schema containing at least one table.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: One table found: t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). No foreign keys; appears to be a game log for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild.

Key checks and evidence
1) Initial counts using the full team name (returned zeros; revealed naming in data)
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE home = 'Minnesota Wild') AS home_games,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE visitor = 'Minnesota Wild') AS away_games,
  COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;

Result:
- home_games: 0
- away_games: 0
- total_games: 14

2) Inspect distinct team labels to find how Minnesota is stored
Executed SQL (home values):
SELECT DISTINCT home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY home;

Executed SQL (visitor values):
SELECT DISTINCT visitor FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY visitor;

Result excerpts show the team is stored as 'minnesota' (lowercase), not 'Minnesota Wild'.

3) Final counts using the stored label 'minnesota'
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE home = 'minnesota') AS home_games_min,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE visitor = 'minnesota') AS away_games_min,
  COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;

Result:
- home_games_min: 6
- away_games_min: 8
- total_games: 14

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild, Minnesota played 6 home games and 8 away games in the logged entries. Therefore, the claim that “Minnesota play at home more time than they play away” is contradicted by the evidence in this data source.

Assumptions and notes
- I interpret “play at home more time than they play away” to mean a greater number of home games than away games.
- The only available table for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season contains 14 games; conclusions are grounded strictly in this dataset, which is treated as authoritative within its scope.
- Team naming in the table uses 'minnesota' (lowercase) rather than the full name 'Minnesota Wild'.
