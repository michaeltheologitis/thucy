Claim to verify: "Chord Finder by Microsoft was released on 2010-11-17 under the category of Utilities."

Data source exploration:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_zune_applications
- Relevant columns: title (text), developer (text), category (text), "release date" (text), version (text)

Evidence via executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the app record for Chord Finder
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE title ILIKE 'Chord Finder';

Result:
- title: chord finder
- developer: microsoft
- category: utilities
- release date: 2010 - 11 - 17
- version: 1.0

Assessment against the claim:
- Title: chord finder → matches "Chord Finder"
- Developer: microsoft → matches "by Microsoft"
- Category: utilities → matches "under the category of Utilities"
- Release date: 2010 - 11 - 17 → matches "released on 2010-11-17" (formatting with spaces around dashes is consistent with the stored data)

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are directly supported by the database record.

Assumptions (minor):
- Case differences (e.g., "microsoft" vs. "Microsoft") do not change meaning.
- The stored date string "2010 - 11 - 17" is interpreted as calendar date 2010-11-17.
