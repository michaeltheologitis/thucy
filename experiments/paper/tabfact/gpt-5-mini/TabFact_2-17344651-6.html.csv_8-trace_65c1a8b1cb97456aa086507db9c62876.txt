Claim to verify: “the boston celtic achieved their lowest score game against the philadelphia 76ers.”

What I checked and data scope
- Available data source contains one relevant table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season. It covers only a portion of the 1984–85 season (January 1985; games 33–46), not the full franchise history.
- I verified the table’s coverage before evaluating the claim.

Evidence 1 — Dataset coverage (shows scope is limited to games 33–46 in Jan 1985)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
Result: row_count = 14, min_game = 33, max_game = 46

SQL executed:
WITH bounds AS (SELECT MIN(game) AS min_g, MAX(game) AS max_g FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_count
FROM bounds
CROSS JOIN LATERAL generate_series(bounds.min_g, bounds.max_g) AS g(game_num)
LEFT JOIN public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season t ON t.game = g.game_num
WHERE t.game IS NULL;
Result: missing_count = 0 (games 33–46 are fully covered; no gaps)

SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS month, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season GROUP BY month ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result: month = "jan", cnt = 14 (all rows are January)

Evidence 2 — Lowest Celtics point total in the available dataset and its opponent
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN((trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)))::int) AS min_celtics FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
Result: [{"min_celtics":86}]

SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, score, location, record
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE (trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)))::int = 86
ORDER BY date;
Result: [{"date":"fri jan 18","game":40,"location":"market square arena","opponent":"indiana pacers","record":"33 - 7","score":"86 - 91"}]
Interpretation: The lowest scoring game in this dataset is 86 points, and it was against the Indiana Pacers, not the Philadelphia 76ers.

Evidence 3 — Celtics scoring in games vs. Philadelphia 76ers (for comparison)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, score
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%philadelphia%'
ORDER BY date;
Result rows: jan 20 — score: 113 - 97; jan 30 — score: 104 - 122

SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, score,
       trim(split_part(score,'-',1))::int AS celtics_points,
       trim(split_part(score,'-',2))::int AS opponent_points
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%philadelphia%'
ORDER BY date;
Result: (113, 97) and (104, 122)
Interpretation: In the two January 1985 meetings, the Celtics scored 113 and 104 points—both higher than 86.

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (games 33–46 of the 1984–85 season), the Celtics’ lowest scoring game was 86 points vs the Indiana Pacers, not the Philadelphia 76ers. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence available here.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Because the accessible data only covers January 1985 (games 33–46), I interpret and judge the claim within this scope. I cannot assess franchise all-time or full-season history beyond these 14 games using the provided data.
- Score parsing assumes the table’s score field is formatted as “CelticsPoints - OpponentPoints,” which is supported by wins/losses and records shown in the rows.
