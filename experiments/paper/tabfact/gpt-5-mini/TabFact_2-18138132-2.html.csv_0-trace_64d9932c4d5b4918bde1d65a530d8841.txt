Claim to verify: “Windows Live Messenger version 14, made by Microsoft, released on 2010-11-17 under the category of Social Networking.”

Data source exploration:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema.
- Relevant table discovered: public.list_of_zune_applications with columns: title (text), developer (text), category (text), "release date" (text), version (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Check existence of Windows Live Messenger entry
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE title ILIKE '%Windows Live Messenger%';
Result:
count
1

2) Retrieve details for Windows Live Messenger
SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE title ILIKE '%Windows Live Messenger%';
Result row:
- title: windows live messenger
- developer: microsoft
- category: social networking
- release date: 2010 - 11 - 17
- version: 1.4

Assessment of claim components against data:
- Product/title: “Windows Live Messenger” — Supported (exact entry exists).
- Developer: “Microsoft” — Supported (developer = “microsoft”).
- Category: “Social Networking” — Supported (category = “social networking”).
- Release date: “2010-11-17” — Supported (stored as text “2010 - 11 - 17”).
- Version: “14” — Not supported; data shows version “1.4”.

Conclusion: All elements match except the version number, which is 1.4 in the data (not 14).

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Zune application entry for Windows Live Messenger in the available dataset.
- Treated the text-form release date “2010 - 11 - 17” as equivalent to 2010-11-17.
- Interpreted “window live messenger” in the user text as “Windows Live Messenger.”
