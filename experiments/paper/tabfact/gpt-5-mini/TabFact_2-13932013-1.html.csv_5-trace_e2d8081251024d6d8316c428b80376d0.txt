Claim: “Brian Sipe started 8 more games than Bernie Kosar.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), public schema
- Table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
  - Relevant columns: quarterback (text), "games started" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Retrieve games started for Brian Sipe and Bernie Kosar
SQL:
SELECT quarterback, "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Sipe%' OR quarterback ILIKE '%Kosar%';
Results:
- sipe , brian — games started: 112
- kosar , bernie — games started: 105

2) Compute the difference (Sipe minus Kosar)
SQL:
SELECT
  (SELECT "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%sipe%') -
  (SELECT "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%kosar%') AS difference;
Result:
- difference: 7

Conclusion
- According to the Cleveland Browns starting-quarterbacks dataset, Brian Sipe started 112 games and Bernie Kosar started 105 games. Sipe started 7 more games than Kosar, not 8.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to starts specifically for the Cleveland Browns, consistent with the dataset’s scope.
- Name matching used case-insensitive search (ILIKE) to match entries stored as “sipe , brian” and “kosar , bernie.”
