Scope and data sources
- Explored available data sources and found a single PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19), schema public.
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season with columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text).

Claim interpreted
- Claim: “1 game be on May 20 in Houston.” Interpreted as asserting that there is exactly one game on May 20 located in Houston, within the available dataset.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check for games on May 20 with location Houston
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date ILIKE 'May 20%' AND location ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result: count = 0
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date ILIKE 'May 20%' AND location ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result: no rows
- Conclusion: No game on May 20 in Houston in this dataset.

2) Context check: games on May 20 (any location)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "winning team", score, location FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date ILIKE '%May 20%';
- Result row:
  { date: "may 20", winning team: "texas", score: "7 - 3", location: "arlington" }
- Conclusion: There is a game on May 20, but it was in Arlington, not Houston.

3) Context check: games located in Houston (any date)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, location, "winning team", score FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE location ILIKE '%houston%';
- Result rows:
  { date: "june 24", location: "houston", winning team: "houston", score: "5 - 2" }
  { date: "june 25", location: "houston", winning team: "texas", score: "6 - 5" }
- Conclusion: Houston-hosted games exist on June 24 and June 25, not on May 20.

Overall conclusion
- The dataset shows zero games on May 20 in Houston. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (2005 Texas Rangers season) as the authoritative source.
- Dates and locations are matched case-insensitively (ILIKE) due to text storage of date/location fields.
