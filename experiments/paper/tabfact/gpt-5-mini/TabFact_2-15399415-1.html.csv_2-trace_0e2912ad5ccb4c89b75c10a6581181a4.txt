Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the orlando_pizzolato results table, there is no 1986 entry for the New York City Marathon, and the time 2:15:20 appears for the 1988 Olympic Games, not for the New York City Marathon.

Evidence and executed SQL:

1) Inspect all available rows to see marathon entries and times
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes FROM public.orlando_pizzolato ORDER BY year ASC LIMIT 200;
Result (excerpt):
- 1984 | competition: new york city marathon | venue: new york , united states | position: 1st | notes: 2:14:53
- 1985 | competition: new york city marathon | venue: new york , united states | position: 1st | notes: 2:11:34
- 1986 | competition: european championships | venue: stuttgart , west germany | position: 2nd | notes: 2:10:57
- 1988 | competition: olympic games | venue: seoul , south korea | position: 16th | notes: 2:15:20
- 1988 | competition: venice marathon | venue: venice , italy | position: 1st | notes: 2:15:24

2) Check explicitly for a 1986 New York City Marathon row
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
WHERE year = 1986
  AND competition ILIKE '%new york city marathon%';
Result: count = 0 (no such row)

3) List all 1986 entries to see what exists for that year
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes FROM public.orlando_pizzolato WHERE year = 1986;
Result:
- 1986 | european championships | stuttgart , west germany | 2nd | 2:10:57

4) Verify where the time 2:15:20 appears
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes FROM public.orlando_pizzolato WHERE notes = '2:15:20';
Result:
- 1988 | olympic games | seoul , south korea | 16th | 2:15:20

5) Show all New York City Marathon rows for context
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes
FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
WHERE competition ILIKE '%new york city marathon%'
ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1984 | new york city marathon | new york , united states | 1st | 2:14:53
- 1985 | new york city marathon | new york , united states | 1st | 2:11:34

Assessment:
- No 1986 New York City Marathon entry exists in the dataset for this athlete.
- The time 2:15:20 is associated with the 1988 Olympic Games, not the NYC Marathon.
Therefore, the claim that the notes record for the 1986 New York City Marathon is 2:15:20 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 'notes' field for Orlando Pizzolato’s record of the New York City Marathon in 1986 within the available TabFact (public.orlando_pizzolato) dataset.
