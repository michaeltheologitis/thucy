Summary

- Finding: False. In the dataset, Titel and Lok differ in multiple columns: settlement name, cyrillic name, type, and population. They share largest ethnic group and dominant religion.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table: list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina.

Schema details (from inspection)
- Columns:
  - settlement — text
  - cyrillic name — text
  - type — text
  - population (2011) — bigint
  - largest ethnic group (2002) — text
  - dominant religion (2002) — text

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for exact-case matches of ‘Titel’ and ‘Lok’
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement IN ('Titel', 'Lok');
Result:
[{"cnt":0}]
Interpretation: No exact-case matches; proceed case-insensitively.

2) Identify case-insensitive matches
SQL:
SELECT settlement FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement ILIKE '%itel%' OR settlement ILIKE '%lok%';
Result:
[{"settlement":"titel"},{"settlement":"lok"}]
Interpretation: Rows exist for lowercase ‘titel’ and ‘lok’.

3) Retrieve full rows for ‘titel’ and ‘lok’
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement ILIKE 'titel' OR settlement ILIKE 'lok';
Result:
[
  {"cyrillic name":"тител","dominant religion (2002)":"orthodox christianity","largest ethnic group (2002)":"serbs","population (2011)":5294,"settlement":"titel","type":"town"},
  {"cyrillic name":"лок","dominant religion (2002)":"orthodox christianity","largest ethnic group (2002)":"serbs","population (2011)":1114,"settlement":"lok","type":"village"}
]

Comparison based on query (3)
- Different:
  - settlement: "titel" vs "lok"
  - cyrillic name: "тител" vs "лок"
  - type: "town" vs "village"
  - population (2011): 5294 vs 1114
- Same:
  - largest ethnic group (2002): serbs
  - dominant religion (2002): orthodox christianity

Conclusion
- The claim that Titel and Lok differ only in population is contradicted by the data. They also differ in type and names.

Assumptions
- Treated settlement names case-insensitively because the table stores them in lowercase ("titel", "lok").
