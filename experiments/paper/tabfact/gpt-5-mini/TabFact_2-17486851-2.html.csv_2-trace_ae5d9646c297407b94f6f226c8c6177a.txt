Claim interpreted: “POR have a free transfer fee.” Interpreted as: In the available TabFact dataset (table t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season), is there a transfer for nationality code ‘por’ whose transfer fee is free?

Finding: Yes. The table contains one transfer with nat = 'por', and its transfer fee is recorded as 'free'.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect transfer-fee value variants to define how to detect “free” transfers
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season ORDER BY "transfer fee";
Result: '-' and 'free'.

2) Count transfers by nationality and how many are free
SQL:
SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS total_transfers,
SUM(CASE WHEN lower("transfer fee") LIKE '%free%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS free_transfers
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
GROUP BY nat
ORDER BY total_transfers DESC, nat;
Key result row: por | 1 | 1 (i.e., 1 total transfer for 'por', 1 is free).

3) Show the detailed row(s) for nat = 'por'
SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'por';
Result:
- name: paulo costa; moving to: anorthosis famagusta; type: mutual consent loan return; transfer window: winter; transfer fee: free.

Conclusion: The available data shows that for nationality 'por' there is a transfer recorded with a free transfer fee.

Assumptions:
- 'por' refers to the nationality code used in the table’s nat column (lowercase country codes), not a club abbreviation.
- A transfer is considered “free” if the transfer fee field contains the string 'free' (case-insensitive). Distinct fee values observed were only '-' and 'free'.
- The verification is constrained to the TabFact table t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season; no broader transfer datasets are available in this environment.
