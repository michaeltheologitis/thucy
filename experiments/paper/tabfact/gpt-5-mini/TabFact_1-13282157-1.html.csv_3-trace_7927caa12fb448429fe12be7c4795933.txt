Claim interpreted: “United States is the country for the player Vijay Singh.”

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (postgres_tabfact17) database with a public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs (columns: "Unnamed: 0" bigint, player text, country text, points bigint, events bigint, "reset points" bigint).

Evidence
1) Case-insensitive lookup of Vijay Singh’s country
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE lower(player) = lower('Vijay Singh');
- Result: player = "vijay singh", country = "fiji".

2) Distinct country values for Vijay Singh (to confirm no alternates)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE lower(player) = 'vijay singh';
- Result: ["fiji"].

3) Explicit check for common “United States” variants for Vijay Singh
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE lower(player) = 'vijay singh' AND lower(country) IN ('united states','united states of america','usa','u.s.a.','u.s.','us');
- Result: cnt = 0.

Conclusion
- The table lists Vijay Singh’s country as “fiji,” and there are zero entries associating him with “United States” (or common variants). The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “The player” refers to the Vijay Singh present in the 2007 FedEx Cup Playoffs table of the TabFact database.
- Matching on names is done case-insensitively due to lower-case storage in this dataset.
- The TabFact dataset is treated as authoritative for the purpose of this verification, per instructions.
