Claim to verify: “the title of every episode in season 1 mention both gary and allison.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact33), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.gary_unmarried with columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision).

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Inspect available rows (to view titles and timeframe)
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot, "18 - 49", viewers
FROM public.gary_unmarried
LIMIT 50;
Result summary: 20 rows returned spanning air dates from September 2008 to May 2009. Episode titles include many starting with “gary …”; some include “allison” (e.g., “gary and allison ’s restaurant”, “gary and allison brooks”, “gary hooks up allison”, “gary fixes allison ’s garbage disposal”). No explicit season field exists; the 2008–2009 air dates and count of 20 episodes align with Season 1 of Gary Unmarried.

2) Total number of episodes in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM public.gary_unmarried;
Result: total_episodes = 20

3) Count titles that mention both “gary” and “allison” (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS both_gary_allison FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE episode ILIKE '%gary%' AND episode ILIKE '%allison%';
Result: both_gary_allison = 4

4) List of titles that mention both “gary” and “allison”
SQL:
SELECT episode FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE episode ILIKE '%gary%' AND episode ILIKE '%allison%';
Results:
- gary and allison 's restaurant
- gary and allison brooks
- gary hooks up allison
- gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal

5) Titles that do NOT mention both names (i.e., not containing both substrings “gary” AND “allison”, case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT episode FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE NOT (episode ILIKE '%gary%' AND episode ILIKE '%allison%') ORDER BY episode;
Results (16 titles):
- gary 's ex - brother - in - law
- gary and dennis' sister
- gary and his half brother
- gary and the trophy
- gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend
- gary dates louise 's teacher
- gary gets boundaries
- gary gets his stuff back
- gary gives thanks
- gary goes first
- gary marries off his ex
- gary meets the gang
- gary moves back in
- gary toughens up tom
- gary uses his veto
- pilot

6) Contextualizing timeframe (extract year from air date)
- Verify extraction and counts per year
SQL (sample with extraction):
SELECT "air date", substring("air date" from '([0-9]{4})') AS year_extracted
FROM gary_unmarried
LIMIT 50;
SQL (counts per year):
SELECT substring("air date" from '([0-9]{4})') AS year, COUNT(*) AS episodes
FROM gary_unmarried
WHERE substring("air date" from '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY substring("air date" from '([0-9]{4})')::int;
SQL (sanity check totals):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       SUM(CASE WHEN substring("air date" from '([0-9]{4})') IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS unknown_year_count
FROM gary_unmarried;
Results:
- Years present: 2008 (11 episodes), 2009 (9 episodes)
- Total rows: 20; unknown_year_count: 0
Interpretation: This matches a 2008–2009 season (Season 1) run.

Conclusion:
- Out of 20 Season 1 episodes in the dataset, only 4 titles include both “gary” and “allison.” Therefore, it is not true that every episode title in Season 1 mentions both names.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity in the claim):
- The claim pertains to the show represented in the available data (Gary Unmarried), and the table public.gary_unmarried corresponds to Season 1 episodes based on 2008–2009 air dates and a total of 20 episodes.
- “Mention” is interpreted as the episode title containing the substrings “gary” and “allison” (case-insensitive) anywhere in the title.
