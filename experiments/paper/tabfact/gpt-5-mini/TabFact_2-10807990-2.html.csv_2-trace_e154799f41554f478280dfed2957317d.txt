Claim to verify: "carlton score 16.13 (109) against the away team south melbourne"

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.t_1942_vfl_season (match-level data: home/away teams, scores, venue, crowd, date)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Direct test of the claim (Carlton home vs South Melbourne away with Carlton scoring 16.13 (109))
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" 
FROM public.t_1942_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" = 'Carlton'
  AND "away team" = 'South Melbourne'
  AND "home team score" = '16.13 (109)';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Retrieve all Carlton vs South Melbourne matches in the table (any case formatting) to see the actual score
SQL:
SELECT "home team","away team","home team score","away team score","date","venue" 
FROM public.t_1942_vfl_season 
WHERE ("home team" ILIKE '%Carlton%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Carlton%') 
  AND ("home team" ILIKE '%South%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%South%') 
ORDER BY "date";
Result (1 row):
- Date: 16 may 1942; Venue: princes park
- Home team: carlton — Home score: 8.11 (59)
- Away team: south melbourne — Away score: 13.21 (99)

Conclusion
- In the available 1942 VFL season data, the only match with South Melbourne as the away team at Carlton shows Carlton scored 8.11 (59), not 16.13 (109). The claim is not supported by this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted against the available dataset (public.t_1942_vfl_season). Team names were matched case-insensitively. If the claim refers to a different season not present in this database, that is outside the accessible data scope.
