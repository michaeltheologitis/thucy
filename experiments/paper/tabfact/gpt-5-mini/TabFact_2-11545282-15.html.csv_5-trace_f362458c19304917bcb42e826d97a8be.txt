Claim to verify: “Greg Ostertag played center and went to Kansas.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact), public schema
- Relevant table identified: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns include player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Evidence gathered:
1) Query to find Greg Ostertag’s position and school
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Result row:
  {"player":"greg ostertag", "position":"center", "school / club team":"kansas"}

Assessment:
- Position: Listed as “center” → supports “played center.”
- School: Listed as “kansas” → supports “went to Kansas” (interpreted as University of Kansas).

Conclusion:
- The data directly supports both parts of the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Went to Kansas” is interpreted as attending/playing for the University of Kansas (college affiliation), which aligns with the “school / club team” field in the dataset.
