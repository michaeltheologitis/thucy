Claim to verify: “St. Louis was the visiting team in the game against New Jersey when the record was 11 - 33 - 12.”

Data source discovery
- I inspected the connected relational data sources and found one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table.
  - Table: public.my_info_table (columns: date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text)

Step 1: Confirm table contents
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: [{"total_rows":11}]

SQL executed:
SELECT row_number() OVER () AS rn, date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY rn;
Result (excerpt of all rows):
1 | february 3  | ny islanders | 7 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 32 - 11
2 | february 5  | new jersey   | 4 - 5 | washington | 11 - 33 - 11
3 | february 6  | vancouver    | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 33 - 12
4 | february 9  | new jersey   | 4 - 5 | chicago    | 11 - 34 - 12
5 | february 12 | new jersey   | 1 - 5 | st louis   | 11 - 35 - 12
6 | february 15 | minnesota    | 3 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 36 - 12
7 | february 20 | new jersey   | 0 - 3 | philadelphia | 11 - 37 - 12
8 | february 21 | buffalo      | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 37 - 13
9 | february 24 | detroit      | 1 - 4 | new jersey | 12 - 37 - 13
10 | february 26| new jersey   | 4 - 5 | pittsburgh | 12 - 38 - 13
11 | february 27| new jersey   | 2 - 6 | buffalo    | 12 - 39 - 13

Observation: The only row where record = 11 - 33 - 12 is rn = 3, with home = new jersey and visitor = vancouver.

Step 2: Directly filter for the record 11 - 33 - 12
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE replace(record, ' ', '') = '11-33-12';
Result: [{"date":"february 6","visitor":"vancouver","score":"4 - 4","home":"new jersey","record":"11 - 33 - 12"}]

Step 3: Check any games involving St. Louis
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower(visitor) = 'st louis' OR lower(home) = 'st louis';
Result:
- february 12 | visitor = new jersey | score = 1 - 5 | home = st louis | record = 11 - 35 - 12

Conclusion based on evidence
- When the record was 11 - 33 - 12 and the opponent was New Jersey (home = new jersey), the visiting team was Vancouver, not St. Louis.
- The only game involving St. Louis in this dataset has St. Louis as the home team, and the record then was 11 - 35 - 12, not 11 - 33 - 12.

Therefore, the claim that St. Louis was the visiting team against New Jersey when the record was 11 - 33 - 12 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Record” refers to the value in the record column for the listed game row.
- “Game against New Jersey” is interpreted as games where New Jersey is the home team (home = new jersey), consistent with the table’s structure.
