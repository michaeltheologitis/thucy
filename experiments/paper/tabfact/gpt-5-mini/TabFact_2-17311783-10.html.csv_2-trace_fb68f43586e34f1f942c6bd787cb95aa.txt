Summary
- The claim appears to assert that the location and attendance are “verizon center 20173” for a game where the record was “49 - 36%”. The available data confirms the location-attendance string “verizon center 20173” but shows the record at that time was “41 - 36,” and no entry exists with a record value of “49 - 36”.

Data source discovery
- Discovered a single accessible database: postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table (per schema inspection): t_2008_09_miami_heat_season with columns including date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Attempt to find a row that simultaneously mentions “Verizon Center” and has a record of “49-36”
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", "team", "location attendance", "record"
FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Verizon Center%'
  AND "record" ILIKE '%49-36%'
ORDER BY "date";
Result: No rows matched.

2) Retrieve any rows mentioning “Verizon Center” to verify location and attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT date, team, score, "location attendance", record
FROM t_2008_09_miami_heat_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Verizon Center%';
Result (1 row):
- date: april 4
- team: washington
- score: w 118 - 104 (ot)
- location attendance: verizon center 20173
- record: 41 - 36
Interpretation: This confirms “verizon center 20173” (location + attendance). The associated record is 41 - 36, not 49 - 36.

3) Check if any row in the table has a record value “49 - 36”
SQL executed (a):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season;
Result: [{"total_rows":8}]

SQL executed (b):
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season
ORDER BY date;
Result rows:
- {date: "april 1", team: "dallas", location attendance: "american airlines center 20021", record: "39 - 36"}
- {date: "april 10", team: "boston", location attendance: "td banknorth garden 18624", record: "41 - 38"}
- {date: "april 12", team: "new york", location attendance: "american airlines arena 19600", record: "42 - 38"}
- {date: "april 14", team: "atlanta", location attendance: "philips arena", record: "42 - 39"}
- {date: "april 15", team: "detroit", location attendance: "american airlines arena", record: "43 - 39"}
- {date: "april 3", team: "charlotte", location attendance: "time warner cable arena 19568", record: "40 - 36"}
- {date: "april 4", team: "washington", location attendance: "verizon center 20173", record: "41 - 36"}
- {date: "april 7", team: "new orleans", location attendance: "american airlines arena 19600", record: "41 - 37"}
Interpretation: No entry has a record of “49 - 36.”

Findings
- True: “verizon center 20173” correctly reflects the recorded location-attendance string for the April 4 game in this dataset (i.e., Verizon Center, attendance 20,173).
- False: The associated record in that row is “41 - 36,” not “49 - 36.” Moreover, there is no row in the table with a record of “49 - 36.”

Conclusion
- The claim is only partly correct. The location and attendance string “verizon center 20173” is supported by the data, but the record value “49 - 36” is not supported; the data shows “41 - 36” for that Verizon Center entry, and no “49 - 36” exists anywhere in the table.

Assumptions
- “verizon center 20173” is interpreted as the location (Verizon Center) and attendance (20,173) from the “location attendance” column.
- “record be 49 - 36%” is interpreted as the team’s record field being “49 - 36” (the percent sign was treated as extraneous punctuation rather than changing the meaning).
