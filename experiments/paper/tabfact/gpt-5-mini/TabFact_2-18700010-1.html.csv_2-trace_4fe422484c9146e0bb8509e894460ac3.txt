Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that the top scorer by league goals is “ian robin.” Based on the available data, I evaluate this within the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season table.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22) database, public schema. Only relevant table found: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season.
- Table columns: name, position, league apps, league goals, fa cup apps, fa cup goals, league cup apps, league cup goals, total apps, total goals.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Determine the maximum number of league goals in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX("league goals") AS max_league_goals FROM public."t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season";
Result: { max_league_goals: 25 }

2) Identify the player(s) with that maximum league goal total
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "league goals" FROM public."t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season" WHERE "league goals" = 25;
Result:
- name: ian robins, league goals: 25

3) Confirm there are no ties by listing all players and league goals in descending order
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "league goals" FROM public."t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season" ORDER BY "league goals" DESC, "name" ASC;
Ordered results:
1. ian robins — 25
2. peter fletcher — 17
3. steve kindon — 14
4. david cowling — 10
5. brian stanton — 9
6. dave sutton — 6
7. mick laverick — 4
8. peter hart — 4
9. ian holmes — 3
10. keith hanvey — 2
11. malcolm brown — 2
12. fred robinson — 1
13. alan starling — 0
14. andy rankin — 0
15. bernard purdie — 0
16. chris topping — 0
17. jim branagan — 0
18. tommy smith — 0

Conclusion
- Supported by the data, the top league scorer is “ian robins” with 25 league goals. The claim states “ian robin,” which appears to be a minor misspelling/omission of the final “s.” Substantively, the claim is correct within this dataset.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the available dataset: the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season table. No broader leagues or seasons are represented in the accessible data.
