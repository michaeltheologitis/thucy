Summary of available data sources
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact9 (schema: public) with a relevant table: public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf.

Schema of the relevant table
- Table: public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Locate Justin Leonard’s entry and retrieve his place and score
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, place, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Leonard%';
- Result (relevant row):
  player: justin leonard; place: t8; score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212

2) Retrieve Justin Leonard’s full row including to-par
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Justin%' AND player ILIKE '%Leonard%';
- Result (one row):
  place: t8; player: justin leonard; country: united states; score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212; to par: + 2

3) Confirm the set of players tied for 8th place (place = 't8') and their scores
- Executed SQL used to confirm case/coding of place values:
  SELECT place, player, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place, player;
- Executed SQL that produced the tie-for-8th list:
  SELECT player, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't8';
- Result (players with place = t8):
  - justin leonard — 73 + 71 + 68 = 212
  - nick faldo — 70 + 76 + 66 = 212

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: "justin leonard score less than 212 which put him tie for the 8th place"
- Based on the data, Justin Leonard’s score is exactly 212 (not less than 212) and his place is t8 (tied for 8th place). Thus:
  - "score less than 212" — contradicted by the data (actual score = 212)
  - "tie for the 8th place" — supported by the data (place = t8)

Conclusion: The claim contains both true and false components; the primary numerical assertion is incorrect while the placement is correct.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 2002 U.S. Open Golf leaderboard represented by the available table t_2002_u_s_open_golf.
- Interpreted the "score" field as the sum shown in the table (73 + 71 + 68 = 212), which the table itself equates to 212.
