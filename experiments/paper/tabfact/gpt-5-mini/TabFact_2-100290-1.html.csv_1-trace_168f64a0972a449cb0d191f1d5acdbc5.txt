Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: There is exactly one instance where the package is “pdip - 20” among rows with EEPROM less than 128.

Data source discovery
- Available source: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact/Postgres connection). Public schema contains a single relevant table.

Schema examined
- Table: my_info_table
  - Columns: chip (text), flash size (text), eeprom (bigint), sram (bigint), frequency (bigint), package (text)

Evidence collected
1) List all rows with eeprom < 128
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT chip, eeprom, package FROM my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128 ORDER BY eeprom ASC;
- Result:
  - chip: at90s1200, eeprom: 64, package: pdip - 20
- Interpretation: Only one row satisfies eeprom < 128, and its package is “pdip - 20”.

2) Count rows where eeprom < 128
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_eeprom_lt_128 FROM my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128;
- Result: count_eeprom_lt_128 = 1

3) Among those, count rows with package exactly ‘pdip - 20’ (case-sensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_eeprom_lt_128_pkg_exact FROM my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128 AND package = 'pdip - 20';
- Result: count_eeprom_lt_128_pkg_exact = 1

4) Case-insensitive confirmation
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_eeprom_lt_128_pkg_ci FROM my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128 AND LOWER(package) = LOWER('pdip - 20');
- Result: count_eeprom_lt_128_pkg_ci = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one row with eeprom < 128, and that row’s package is “pdip - 20”. This directly supports the claim that “pdip - 20 be the package when eeprom be less than 128 on 1 occasion.”

Assumptions
- “Less than 128” is interpreted as a strict numerical condition (eeprom < 128) on the bigint eeprom field.
- Package matching considered both exact and case-insensitive; both yielded the same single match.
