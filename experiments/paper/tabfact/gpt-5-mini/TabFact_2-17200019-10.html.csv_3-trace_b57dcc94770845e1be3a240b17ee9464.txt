Summary
- I explored all accessible data sources and found only one relevant database (TabFact/postgres_tabfact7) with a single soccer-related table for R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season. There is no table or column referencing the UEFA Champions League. Therefore, I cannot find any data that could verify the claim about Guillaume Gillet’s scoring “3 times as much as each of the other 2 player in the UEFA Champions League tournament.” The available data does not contain Champions League statistics at all.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Enumerate all tables in the public schema
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_name;
Result:
- t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season

2) Search for any tables whose names suggest UEFA/Champions League data
SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND (table_name ILIKE '%uefa%' OR table_name ILIKE '%champions%' OR table_name ILIKE '%league%' OR table_name ILIKE '%champions_league%')
ORDER BY table_name;
Result: 0 rows (no matching tables)

3) Inspect the only soccer-related table’s structure and sample rows
3a) Columns
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result columns:
- player (text)
- title playoff (bigint)
- super cup (bigint)
- total (bigint)
- league (bigint)

3b) First 10 rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt includes:
- guillaume gillet | league: 8 | title playoff: 0 | super cup: 0 | total: 9
(plus other Anderlecht players and their domestic tallies)

4) Confirm presence of Guillaume Gillet in this table
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE player ILIKE '%Gillet%'
   OR player ILIKE '%Guillaume%';
Result:
- player: guillaume gillet | league: 8 | title playoff: 0 | super cup: 0 | total: 9

5) Search for any columns in any table that might reference UEFA/Champions League or European competition
SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND (
    column_name ILIKE '%uefa%'
    OR column_name ILIKE '%champ%'
    OR column_name ILIKE '%europe%'
  )
ORDER BY table_name, column_name;
Result: 0 rows (no such columns)

6) Check for other Anderlecht-related tables (to see if other seasons or competitions exist)
SQL:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name ILIKE '%anderlecht%'
ORDER BY table_name;
Result:
- t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season

Conclusion
- The accessible data contains no UEFA Champions League tables or columns, and therefore provides no basis to evaluate or verify the claim about Guillaume Gillet’s Champions League scoring relative to “the other 2 player.” Based on the available evidence, the claim is unsupported.

Assumptions noted
- I assumed the TabFact (postgres_tabfact7) database is the only available data source for verification.
- I interpreted the claim as referring specifically to the UEFA Champions League, not domestic or other competitions.
- The phrase “the other 2 player” is ambiguous (which two players, which season?), but even with a reasonable interpretation, verification would require Champions League data that is not present in the accessible database.
