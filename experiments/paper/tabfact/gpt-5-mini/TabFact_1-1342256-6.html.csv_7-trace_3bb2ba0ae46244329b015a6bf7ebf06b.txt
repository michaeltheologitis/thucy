Interpretation of claim: The statement appears to assert that, for the entry where the 'first elected' year is 1926 (in the available elections data), the party is Democratic.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942, with columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates.

Evidence gathered from the data:
1) Exact year match query
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE "first elected" = '1926';
- Result:
  - district: california 2
  - incumbent: harry lane englebright
  - party: republican
  - first elected: 1926
  - result: re - elected
  - candidates: harry lane englebright (r) unopposed

2) Substring match to ensure no other 1926 variants exist
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE "first elected" LIKE '%1926%';
- Result:
  - district: california 2; incumbent: harry lane englebright; party: republican; first elected: 1926

Assessment of the claim:
- The only row with 'first elected' containing 1926 in the available dataset has party = Republican, not Democratic.
- Therefore, the claim that "Democratic be the party with first elect be 1926" is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available elections table (united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942) and is about the party corresponding to any entry whose 'first elected' year is 1926. No other context (district/incumbent) was provided, so the verification was performed across the entire table.
