Claim to verify: “shane hall have an average finish of 33.39 between 1995 - 2008.”

Data sources discovered
- Connected PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact18 (TabFact), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.shane_hall
  - Columns: year (bigint), races (bigint), wins (bigint), poles (bigint), "top 5" (bigint), "top 10" (bigint), dnf (bigint), finish (double precision), start (double precision), winnings (bigint), "season rank" (text), "team (s)" (text).

Evidence and computations
1) Retrieve Shane Hall’s yearly finish values from 1995–2008
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, finish, (SELECT AVG(finish) FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008) AS overall_avg
  FROM public.shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008
  ORDER BY year;
- Result (year | finish):
  1995 | 24.0
  1996 | 26.4
  1997 | 27.1
  1998 | 24.9
  1999 | 25.8
  2000 | 35.0
  2001 | 27.9
  2002 | 27.0
  2003 | 35.8
  2004 | 31.4
  2005 | 40.9
  2006 | 38.9
  2008 | 43.0
  Computed overall simple average (repeated on each row): 31.39230769230769

2) Confirm counts of years and total races in the same range
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS years_count, SUM(races) AS total_races
  FROM public.shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
- Result: years_count = 13, total_races = 190

3) Simple (unweighted) average finish across 1995–2008
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT AVG(finish) AS simple_avg
  FROM public.shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
- Result: simple_avg = 31.39230769230769

4) Races-weighted average finish across 1995–2008
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(finish * races)::double precision / NULLIF(SUM(races),0) AS weighted_avg
  FROM public.shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
- Result: weighted_avg = 28.278947368421058

Conclusion
- The database shows Shane Hall’s simple average finish across 1995–2008 (inclusive, for years present) is approximately 31.39, and the races-weighted average is approximately 28.28. Both differ materially from the claimed 33.39. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions/notes
- “Between 1995–2008” is treated as inclusive and based on the rows present. The table does not include an entry for 2007; per SQL AVG semantics, only present years are included. If the claim refers to another series/scope or a different weighting method not reflected in this table, that could explain the discrepancy, but the accessible authoritative data do not support 33.39.
