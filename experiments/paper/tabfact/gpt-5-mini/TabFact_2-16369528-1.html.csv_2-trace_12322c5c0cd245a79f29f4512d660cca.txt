FROM (
  SELECT unnest(string_to_array(replace(replace(lower("lifetime achievement"), ' & ', '|'), ' and ', '|'), '|')) AS x
  FROM public.ned_kelly_awards

    FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
    WHERE year > 2005

FROM (VALUES
('Andrew Rule'),('John Silvester'),('Sandra Harvey'),('Lindsay Simpson'),('Marele Day'),('Shane Maloney'),('Peter Doyle')
) AS c(claimed_name)
LEFT JOIN normalized n ON lower(c.claimed_name) = n.name
ORDER BY c.claimed_name;
Results:
- Andrew Rule → true
- John Silvester → true
- Lindsay Simpson → true
- Marele Day → true
- Peter Doyle → true
- Sandra Harvey → true
- Shane Maloney → true

Conclusion
The database shows that, for years after 2005, the Lifetime Achievement award entries correspond exactly to: Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day, Shane Maloney, and Peter Doyle. The claim matches the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "after 2005" as year > 2005 (i.e., 2006 onward).
- Treated the literal value "na" (2011) as indicating no award/unknown and excluded it from the winner list.
- Normalized names case-insensitively and split multiple names on " and " and " & ".
