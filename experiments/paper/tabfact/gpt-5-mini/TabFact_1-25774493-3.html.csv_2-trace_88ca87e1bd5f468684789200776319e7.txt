Claim to verify: "there be 2.4 block per game in the selection where not field goal percentage be 594 (2nd)".

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
  - Relevant columns: selection (bigint), season (text), field goal percentage (text), blocks per game (double precision)

Evidence
1) Inspect all rows to understand values for field goal percentage and blocks per game
Executed SQL:
SELECT selection, season, "field goal percentage", "blocks per game" FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard ORDER BY selection ASC;
Results:
- selection = 1 | season = 2005 - 06 (1 / 1) | field goal percentage = 531 | blocks per game = 0.7
- selection = 2 | season = 2006 - 07 (1 / 1) | field goal percentage = 576 | blocks per game = 1.9
- selection = 3 | season = 2007 - 08 (1 / 2) | field goal percentage = 618 | blocks per game = 2.7
- selection = 4 | season = 2007 - 08 (2 / 2) | field goal percentage = 598 | blocks per game = 2.9
- selection = 5 | season = 2010 - 11 (1 / 2) | field goal percentage = 594 (2nd) | blocks per game = 2.4

2) Test the specific claim (existence of a row with blocks per game = 2.4 when field goal percentage is NOT '594 (2nd)')
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
WHERE "blocks per game" = 2.4
  AND "field goal percentage" <> '594 (2nd)';
Result:
- cnt = 0

3) Confirm where blocks per game = 2.4 occurs
Executed SQL:
SELECT selection, season, "field goal percentage", "blocks per game"
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
WHERE "blocks per game" = 2.4;
Result:
- selection: 5 | season: 2010 - 11 (1 / 2) | field goal percentage: 594 (2nd) | blocks per game: 2.4

Assessment
- The only row with blocks per game = 2.4 has field goal percentage exactly '594 (2nd)'.
- There are zero rows where blocks per game = 2.4 and field goal percentage is not '594 (2nd)'.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the phrase "where not field goal percentage be 594 (2nd)" as filtering to rows where the text value of the field goal percentage column is not exactly '594 (2nd)'.
- Used exact numeric equality for blocks per game = 2.4 and exact text comparison for field goal percentage.
- Treated the table public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard as the intended dataset given it contains both columns mentioned in the claim.
