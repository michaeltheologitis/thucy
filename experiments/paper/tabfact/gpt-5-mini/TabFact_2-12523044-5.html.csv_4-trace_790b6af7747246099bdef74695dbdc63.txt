Conclusion: Verified against the available data. In the TabFact database (public schema), table public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf contains 5 players whose country is listed as 'united states'.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Country distribution (shows there are 5 rows for 'united states')
SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY row_count DESC, country;

Result excerpt:
- united states — 5
- australia — 1
- england — 1
- ireland — 1
- northern ireland — 1
- scotland — 1

2) Confirm exact country values present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY country;

Result:
[{"country":"australia"},{"country":"england"},{"country":"ireland"},{"country":"northern ireland"},{"country":"scotland"},{"country":"united states"}]

3) Count players where country is exactly 'united states'
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(trim(country)) = 'united states';

Result:
[{"cnt":5}]

4) List the players from 'united states'
SQL:
SELECT place, player
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE lower(trim(country)) = 'united states'
ORDER BY player;

Result:
[{"place":"t7","player":"arron oberholser"},{"place":"t7","player":"jason dufner"},{"place":"t5","player":"jim furyk"},{"place":"t7","player":"phil mickelson"},{"place":"1","player":"steve stricker"}]

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the accessible TabFact database and its table public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf.
- "united state" is interpreted as "united states" (exact country value present in the data).
