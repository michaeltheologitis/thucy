Summary conclusion: The claim that production code 467671 has 24.8 million US viewers is contradicted by the data. In the available Friends Season 5 dataset, production code 467671 corresponds to an episode with 20.9 million US viewers. The episode with 24.8 million US viewers has production code 467663.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema) containing a table relevant to TV episodes: friends_season_5.
- Schema inspection showed columns for production code and US viewership (millions).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the relevant table and columns
- Finding: Table friends_season_5 with columns including "production code" (bigint) and "us viewers (millions)" (double precision).
- Source: Schema inspection of public schema (no SQL required; tool-based discovery).

2) Check the episode with production code 467671
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "no in series", "no in season", "original air date", "us viewers (millions)" FROM friends_season_5 WHERE "production code" = 467671;
Result:
- title: the one with the ball
- no in series: 118
- no in season: 21
- original air date: may 6 , 1999
- us viewers (millions): 20.9
Interpretation: Production code 467671 corresponds to 20.9 million US viewers, not 24.8.

3) Find any episode(s) with 24.8 million US viewers
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "production code", "us viewers (millions)" FROM friends_season_5 WHERE "us viewers (millions)" = 24.8;
