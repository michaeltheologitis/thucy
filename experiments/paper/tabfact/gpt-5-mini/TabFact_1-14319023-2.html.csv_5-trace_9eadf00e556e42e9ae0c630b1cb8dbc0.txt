Claim to verify: “In 2010, the girls’ doubles were Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia, and the boys’ doubles were Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.”

Data source consulted: TabFact database, public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships (treated as authoritative per instructions).

Evidence
1) Champions for 2010 (direct check)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "boys doubles", "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2010;
- Result:
  { "year": 2010, "boys doubles": "jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita", "girls doubles": "aris budiharti dian fitriani" }
- Interpretation:
  • Boys’ doubles 2010: Jones Ralfy Jansen / Dandi Prabudita (matches the claim)
  • Girls’ doubles 2010: Aris Budiharti / Dian Fitriani (does not match the claim)

2) Check for any year with girls’ doubles including “Ayu” or “Anggi” (to identify possible year mismatch)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE lower("girls doubles") LIKE '%ayu%' OR lower("girls doubles") LIKE '%anggi%';
- Result:
  year: 2009, girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia
- Interpretation:
  • The pair Ayu Pratiwi / Anggi Widia appears in 2009, not 2010.

3) Side-by-side for 2009 and 2010
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "year", "boys doubles", "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "year" IN (2009, 2010) ORDER BY "year";
- Returned rows:
  • 2009 — boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita; girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia
  • 2010 — boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita; girls doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani
- Interpretation:
  • The boys’ pair Jones Ralfy Jansen / Dandi Prabudita won in both 2009 and 2010.
  • The girls’ pair Ayu Pratiwi / Anggi Widia were champions in 2009, while in 2010 it was Aris Budiharti / Dian Fitriani.

Conclusion
- Boys’ doubles (2010): Verified as Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.
- Girls’ doubles (2010): Not Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia; per the data, it was Aris Budiharti and Dian Fitriani. The claimed girls’ pair corresponds to 2009, not 2010.

Assumptions
- “girl double” and “boy double” are interpreted as the Girls’ Doubles and Boys’ Doubles winners at the Indonesian National Badminton Championships.
- Names are reported exactly as stored (all lowercase, concatenated by spaces).
