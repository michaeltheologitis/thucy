What I checked
- Claim: “the dundee hurricane have 2 losing season, in 2006 and 2009.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema) containing a table named dundee_hurricanes.
- Schema details for dundee_hurricanes: columns — season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), final position (text), notes (text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Full seasons overview to determine which seasons were losing (wins < losses)
SQL executed:
SELECT season, wins, losses, ties, (wins < losses) AS losing_season
FROM dundee_hurricanes
ORDER BY season;

Results:
- 2003 — 6–4–0 — losing_season: false
- 2004 — 6–2–1 — losing_season: false
- 2005 — 5–5–0 — losing_season: false
- 2006 — 3–4–0 — losing_season: true
- 2007 — 9–1–0 — losing_season: false
- 2008 — 5–2–3 — losing_season: false
- 2009 — 2–6–1 — losing_season: true

2) Direct check for 2006 and 2009
SQL executed:
SELECT season, wins, losses, ties, (wins < losses) AS losing_season
FROM dundee_hurricanes
WHERE season IN (2006, 2009)
ORDER BY season;

Results:
- 2006 — 3–4–0 — losing_season: true
- 2009 — 2–6–1 — losing_season: true

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly two losing seasons in the available data, and they are 2006 and 2009. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Definition of “losing season” used: wins < losses (ties do not change the losing designation unless wins are fewer than losses).
- Verification is based on the seasons present in the dundee_hurricanes table (2003–2009).
