What I checked
- Explored available data sources: One PostgreSQL source with table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (players, positions, school/club team).
- Verified whether Georgia and Penn State alumni on the Utah Jazz all‑time roster include players at the center and guard positions.

Relevant schema
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence
1) Roster entries from Georgia or Penn State
SQL executed:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%penn state%';
Results:
- john amaechi — center / forward — penn state
- shandon anderson — guard / forward — georgia

2) Position counts among those entries
SQL executed:
SELECT position, COUNT(*) AS count FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%penn state%' GROUP BY position ORDER BY count DESC;
Results:
- center / forward: 1
- guard / forward: 1

Conclusion
- Penn State contributes a player listed as center/forward (John Amaechi) and Georgia contributes a player listed as guard/forward (Shandon Anderson). Interpreting hybrid labels as including the core positions, the data shows a center and a guard represented by Penn State and Georgia, respectively.

Assumptions
- "3 different position" refers to the standard basketball positions (guard, forward, center).
- Hybrid designations (e.g., guard/forward, center/forward) count as including the core positions (guard and center).
- "Georgia" refers to the University of Georgia; "Penn State" refers to Pennsylvania State University; both are matched via substring in the "school / club team" field.
