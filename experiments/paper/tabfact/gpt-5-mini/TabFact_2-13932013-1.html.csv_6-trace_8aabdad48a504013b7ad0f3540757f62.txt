Claim to verify
"4 of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have 2 different uniform numbers."

Data source discovery
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact25), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
  - Columns: quarterback (text), "uniform no (s)" (text), games started (bigint), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), "winning pct" (double precision)

Approach
- Interpret "have 2 different uniform numbers" as quarterbacks whose "uniform no (s)" field lists exactly two numbers for their Browns tenure.
- Normalize the uniform numbers by removing whitespace and splitting on commas, then count how many numbers are listed per quarterback.

Evidence
1) Count total starting quarterbacks (context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_qbs FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;
Result:
- total_qbs = 47

2) Compute per-quarterback count of listed uniform numbers and summarize
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN num_numbers=1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_1,
  SUM(CASE WHEN num_numbers=2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_2,
  SUM(CASE WHEN num_numbers>=3 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_3_or_more
FROM (
  SELECT CASE WHEN regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g') = '' THEN 0
            ELSE array_length(string_to_array(regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g'), ','), 1)
       END AS num_numbers
  FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
) t;
Results:
- count_1 = 44
- count_2 = 3
- count_3_or_more = 0
Interpretation: Exactly 3 quarterbacks have two listed uniform numbers.

3) Identify the quarterbacks with exactly two uniform numbers
Executed SQL:
SELECT quarterback, "uniform no (s)" AS original, regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g') AS cleaned,
       array_length(string_to_array(regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g'), ','), 1) AS num_numbers
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE CASE WHEN regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g') = '' THEN 0
           ELSE array_length(string_to_array(regexp_replace(coalesce("uniform no (s)", ''), '\\s+', '', 'g'), ','), 1)
      END = 2
ORDER BY quarterback;
Results:
- graham , otto — original: "60 , 14" — cleaned: "60,14" — num_numbers: 2
- ninowski , jim — original: "15 , 11" — cleaned: "15,11" — num_numbers: 2
- ratterman , george — original: "12 , 16" — cleaned: "12,16" — num_numbers: 2

Conclusion
- The data show 3 Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks with exactly two uniform numbers, not 4. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- "Starting quarterbacks" are represented by all rows in public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
- "Have 2 different uniform numbers" means the "uniform no (s)" field lists exactly two numbers for that quarterback, determined by removing whitespace and splitting the stored text on commas.
