Claim to verify: “the earliest year when the result be nominate and the role / episode be fox mulder be 1996.”

Step 1 — Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table (via schema inspection): list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
  - Columns: year (bigint), category (text), recipients and nominees (text), role / episode (text), result (text)

Step 2 — Evidence from the data (exact executed SQL and results)

1) Find earliest year with result = 'Nominated' and role/episode mentioning Fox Mulder:
SQL:
SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
WHERE result = 'Nominated'
  AND ("role / episode" ILIKE '%Fox Mulder%' OR "role / episode" ILIKE '%Mulder%');
Result:
[{"min_year": null}]
Interpretation: No entries match both conditions; there is no minimum year.

2) Show rows that mention “Mulder” in role/episode for context:
SQL:
SELECT year, category, "recipients and nominees", "role / episode", result
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
WHERE "role / episode" ILIKE '%Mulder%'
ORDER BY year;
Result:
[{"year": 1996, "category": "best actor in a leading role - drama series", "recipients and nominees": "david duchovny", "role / episode": "fox mulder", "result": "won"}]
Interpretation: The only row referencing “fox mulder” has result = 'won' in 1996, not 'Nominated'.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no record where result = 'Nominated' and role/episode references “Fox Mulder.” Therefore, there is no “earliest year” for such a combination. The specific claim that this earliest year is 1996 is contradicted by the data. The only Fox Mulder row is a 1996 'won', not 'Nominated'.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “result be nominate” as result = 'Nominated' (case-insensitive exact match).
- Interpreted “role / episode be fox mulder” as the "role / episode" field containing 'Fox Mulder' (case-insensitive).
