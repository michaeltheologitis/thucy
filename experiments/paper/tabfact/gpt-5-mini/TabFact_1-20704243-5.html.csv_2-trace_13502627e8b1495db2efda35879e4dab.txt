Claim interpreted: “Season 1 [of Leverage] was directed by Dean Devlin.”

What the data shows
- The only relevant table available is public.list_of_leverage_episodes. It includes a “season” and a “directed by” column.
- In this dataset, Season 1 has exactly one row, and that row lists “dean devlin” as the director.
- The table appears to contain only one episode per season, so it does not provide full season coverage.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all Season 1 entries with their director
Executed SQL:
SELECT series, title, "directed by" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE season = 1 ORDER BY series;
Result:
- series 45 — title: "the long way down job" — directed by: dean devlin

2) Show dataset coverage per season and distinct Season 1 director(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;
Results (partial):
- season 1: episode_count = 1
- season 2: episode_count = 1
- season 3: episode_count = 1
- … (one episode per season listed through season 17, with season 9 absent)

Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "directed by" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE season = 1 ORDER BY "directed by";
Result:
- dean devlin

3) Count Season 1 rows directed by Dean Devlin vs. not
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS dean_devlin_count
FROM list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE season = 1
  AND lower("directed by") LIKE '%dean devlin%';
Result:
- dean_devlin_count = 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS not_dean_devlin_count
FROM list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE season = 1
  AND ("directed by" IS NULL OR lower("directed by") NOT LIKE '%dean devlin%');
Result:
- not_dean_devlin_count = 0

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the single Season 1 entry is directed by Dean Devlin. However, because the table contains only one episode per season, it does not establish that the entire Season 1 was directed by him. Therefore, the claim is supported only insofar as the dataset’s Season 1 entry is concerned, not the whole season.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the TV series Leverage (the only show represented in the available data) and to Season 1 in that table.
- Director name matching is case-insensitive on the literal string “dean devlin.”
