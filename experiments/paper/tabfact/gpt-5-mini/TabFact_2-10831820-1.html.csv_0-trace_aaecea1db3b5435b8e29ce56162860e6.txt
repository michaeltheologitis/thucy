Claim to verify: “Zoë Wanamaker played the character Ariadne Oliver.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact), public schema, containing the table: public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes.

Evidence gathered from executed SQL queries:
1) Identify table columns
- SQL:
  SELECT ordinal_position, column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_name = 'list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (per column):
  - 1: actor (text)
  - 2: character (text)
  - 3: title / rank (text)
  - 4: series (text)
  - 5: years (text)
  This confirms the table captures actor-character mappings and related details.

2) Directly check for Zoë Wanamaker or Ariadne Oliver
- SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes
  WHERE actor ILIKE '%wanamaker%'
     OR "character" ILIKE '%ariadne oliver%';
- Result (1 row):
  - actor: zoë wanamaker
  - character: ariadne oliver
  - title / rank: crime novelist
  - series: 10 - 13
  - years: 2006 - 2013

Conclusion:
- The table explicitly lists “zoë wanamaker” as the actor for the character “ariadne oliver,” confirming the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the user’s message as the claim that Zoë Wanamaker portrayed Ariadne Oliver (not merely sharing a scene or being associated with the character).
