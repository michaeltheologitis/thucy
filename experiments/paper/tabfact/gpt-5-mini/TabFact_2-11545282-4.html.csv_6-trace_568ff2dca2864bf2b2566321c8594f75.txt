Claim to verify: “Darryl Dawkins played for the Jazz 7 years before Paul Dawkins.”

Summary of findings
- Both Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins appear on the Utah Jazz all-time roster in the data.
- Paul Dawkins’ Jazz season is 1979–80.
- Darryl Dawkins’ Jazz season is 1987–88.
- Therefore, Darryl did not play before Paul; he played after Paul. The gap between their Jazz start seasons is 8 years (1987 − 1979 = 8), not 7.

Supporting evidence from the database (exact executed SQL and results)
1) Count players with last name “Dawkins” on the Jazz roster
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';
Result:
[{"count":2}]

2) List the Dawkins entries and their Jazz years
SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';
Result:
[{"player":"darryl dawkins","years for jazz":"1987 - 88"},{"player":"paul dawkins","years for jazz":"1979 - 80"}]

Interpretation
- Order: Paul Dawkins (1979–80) precedes Darryl Dawkins (1987–88).
- Difference in start seasons: 1987 − 1979 = 8 years. This contradicts “7 years before” and also reverses the stated direction (Darryl was after, not before, Paul).

Conclusion
- True: Darryl Dawkins did play for the Jazz (1987–88).
- False: He did not do so 7 years before Paul; he did so roughly 8 years after Paul.

Assumptions
- “Jazz” is interpreted as the Utah Jazz franchise as represented by the table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster.
- Year differences are computed using the starting season year shown in the "years for jazz" column.
