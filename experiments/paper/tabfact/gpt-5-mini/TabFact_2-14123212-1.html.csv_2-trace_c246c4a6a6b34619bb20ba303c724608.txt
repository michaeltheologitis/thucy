Summary
- Interpreting the claim in the context of the available dataset (public.whlp): For all translator entries in this table, every call sign includes a three-digit number that begins with 2. The data shows six entries, each with a translator-style call sign pattern (e.g., w221by), and all satisfy the stated condition.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact22), public schema. One table found: public.whlp.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Table public.whlp with columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (double precision), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text). No keys.

Evidence
1) Distinct class values and counts (to understand the scope of records)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "class", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.whlp
GROUP BY "class"
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- class = 'd' — count = 6

2) List of call signs
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "class", "fcc info" FROM public.whlp;
Results:
- w221by | d | fcc
- w264bf | d | fcc
- w240bj | d | fcc
- w276bm | d | fcc
- w293al | d | fcc
- w223au | d | fcc

3) Pattern verification — count of rows with call signs matching one letter, then a three-digit number starting with 2, then two letters (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM public.whlp;
Result: total_rows = 6

Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS matching_rows FROM public.whlp WHERE TRIM("call sign") ~* '^[A-Z]2[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{2}$';
Result: matching_rows = 6

4) Check for any non-matching rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS non_matching_rows FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" !~* '^[A-Z]2[0-9]{2}[A-Z]{2}$';
Result: non_matching_rows = 0

Conclusion
- All six records have call signs containing a three-digit number that begins with 2. No exceptions were found in the dataset.

Assumptions
- The term "translator" refers to the records in public.whlp (all of which have translator-style call signs). The verification and conclusion are strictly about the available dataset.
