Claim to verify: “round 9 involve the player name glen capriola who play college at the citadel.”

Conclusion: The data shows that Glenn Capriola was indeed a Round 9 draft pick in the Colts’ draft history, but his listed college is Boston College, not The Citadel. Separately, a Colts draftee from The Citadel (Brian Ruff) appears in Round 11, not Round 9.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):

1) Search for any Colts draft pick with last name “Capriola” and show round and college
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, round, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%';
- Result:
  {"name": "glenn capriola", "round": 9, "college": "boston college"}
- Interpretation: Glenn Capriola appears in Round 9, but his college is Boston College.

2) Search for any Colts draft pick from The Citadel
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, round, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE college ILIKE '%Citadel%';
- Result:
  {"name": "brian ruff", "round": 11, "college": "the citadel"}
- Interpretation: The Citadel shows up for Brian Ruff in Round 11, not for Glenn Capriola.

3) Directly check for any Round 9 Colts picks from The Citadel
- SQL executed:
  SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  WHERE round = 9
  ORDER BY overall;
- Result:
  [{"college":"boston college","name":"glenn capriola","overall":247,"pick":24,"position":"running back","round":9}]

- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS citadel_count
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  WHERE round = 9 AND college ILIKE '%Citadel%';
- Result:
  [{"citadel_count":0}]
- Interpretation: No Round 9 Colts draft picks are from The Citadel; the sole Round 9 entry is Glenn Capriola from Boston College.

Assessment of the claim components:
- “round 9 involve the player name glen(n) capriola” — Supported by data (name appears as “glenn capriola”).
- “who play college at the citadel” — Contradicted by data (listed college is Boston College). 

Assumptions:
- Context interpreted as the Indianapolis Colts draft history (the available verified dataset).
- Name matching is case-insensitive and tolerant to the single/double “n” spelling (glen vs. glenn).
