Summary of the claim
Claim: “the yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 2:1 in the balken [Balkan] cup against poland on march 22.”

Bottom line: The data contradicts the claim on all key points (opponent, competition, date, and outcome). There is no Yugoslavia vs Poland match in the Balkan Cup; the only Yugoslavia–Poland entry is a friendly on April 26 (2:1). The only March 22 entry is vs Uruguay (2:1, friendly). The dataset also shows a much heavier Balkan Cup defeat (1:4 vs Romania), contradicting the “worst outcome” assertion.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema
- Relevant table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date [text], city [text], opponent [text], results [text], type of game [text])

Verification steps and evidence
1) Are there Yugoslavia matches vs Poland in this dataset?
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE opponent = 'Poland';
  Result: count = 0
- SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%poland%'
  ORDER BY date;
  Result:
  • date: april 26; city: borovo; opponent: poland; results: 2:1; type of game: friendly
Interpretation: Exactly one Poland match exists in this table, and it is a friendly on April 26 with a 2:1 scoreline (Yugoslavia listed first), not a Balkan Cup match.

2) Any Yugoslavia–Poland match labeled as Balkan Cup?
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%poland%' AND "type of game" ILIKE '%balkan%';
  Result: match_count = 0
Interpretation: No Yugoslavia vs Poland matches in the Balkan Cup.

3) What happened on March 22?
- SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE date ILIKE '%march 22%';
  Result:
  • date: march 22; city: sarajevo; opponent: uruguay; results: 2:1; type of game: friendly
Interpretation: On March 22, the recorded match is vs Uruguay (not Poland) and is a friendly (not Balkan Cup). Score 2:1 with Yugoslavia listed first, indicating a win, not a loss.

4) Did Yugoslavia ever lose 1:2 to Poland in this dataset?
- SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Poland%' AND results LIKE '%1:2%';
  Result: no rows
Interpretation: No evidence of a 1:2 loss to Poland.

5) What Balkan Cup matches exist in this dataset (for context and “worst outcome”)?
- SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE lower("type of game") LIKE '%balkan%'
  ORDER BY date;
  Results:
  • date: august 27; city: bucharest , romania; opponent: romania; results: 1:4; type of game: balkan cup
  • date: march 30; city: belgrade; opponent: romania; results: 2:0; type of game: balkan cup
Interpretation: The Balkan Cup entries are against Romania, not Poland. A 1:4 loss exists, which would be a worse defeat than 1:2, further contradicting the “worst outcome” element of the claim.

Conclusion
- Opponent: Not Poland for Balkan Cup; March 22 match is vs Uruguay. False.
- Competition: Not Balkan Cup for the Poland match; the only Balkan Cup opponents here are Romania. False.
- Date: March 22 match is a friendly vs Uruguay, not Poland. False.
- Outcome: No 1:2 loss to Poland; the only Poland match is a 2:1 friendly (Yugoslavia score first, indicating a win). False.
- “Worst outcome”: Not supported; dataset shows a 1:4 Balkan Cup defeat vs Romania, which is a heavier loss than 1:2. False.
Overall, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Balken cup” is interpreted as “Balkan Cup.”
- The results field lists Yugoslavia’s score first (standard convention in team-specific results tables).
- The date column is stored as text without years; matching used case-insensitive substring search (e.g., 'march 22').
