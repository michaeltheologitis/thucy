Scope and data source
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance for the TabFact project with a public schema containing a relevant table: public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money).

Goal interpreted
- Verify whether, among those tied for ninth place in this table, three are from the United States.

Evidence 1: Identify which values correspond to ninth place
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;
- Result (place): 1, 5, 8, t2, t6, t9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, digits_only,
         CASE WHEN digits_only = '' THEN NULL ELSE digits_only::int END AS numeric_place,
         CASE WHEN digits_only <> '' AND digits_only::int = 9 THEN true ELSE false END AS is_ninth
  FROM (
    SELECT DISTINCT place, regexp_replace(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS digits_only
    FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
  ) AS sub
  ORDER BY place;
- Result shows t9 → numeric_place = 9, is_ninth = true, confirming t9 corresponds to ninth place (tie).

Evidence 2: List who is tied for ninth and their countries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't9' ORDER BY player;
- Result:
  - Hubert Green — united states
  - José María Olazábal — spain
  - Paul Azinger — united states
  - Tom Kite — united states

Evidence 3: Count how many tied for ninth are from the United States
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS us_count FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't9' AND lower(country) = 'united states';
- Result: us_count = 3

Finding
- There are 4 players tied for ninth place, and 3 of them are from the United States. This directly supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- “united state” refers to “United States”; matching was done case-insensitively via lower(country) = 'united states'.
- The claim pertains to the table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf and its notion of tied places indicated by the prefix 't' (e.g., t9).
