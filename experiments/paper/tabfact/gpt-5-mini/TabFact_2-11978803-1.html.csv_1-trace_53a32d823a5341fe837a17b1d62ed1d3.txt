Summary conclusion:
The data shows that on August 15, 2012 there is a match entry with result "win" and the venue listed as "baku , azerbaijan". Therefore, the match that resulted in a win on that date was played at a Baku venue.

Data source inspected:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: branimir_suba_i (columns: date, venue, score, result, competition)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate the row for August 15, 2012
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE date ILIKE '%August%15%2012%' OR date ILIKE '%Aug%15%2012%' OR date = 'August 15, 2012'
LIMIT 50;

Result:
[{"competition":"friendly","date":"august 15 , 2012","result":"win","score":"3 - 0","venue":"baku , azerbaijan"}]

2) Verify the venue contains "Baku" for the winning result on that date
SQL executed:
SELECT venue, venue ILIKE '%baku%' AS contains_baku
FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE (date ILIKE '%August%15%2012%' OR date ILIKE '%Aug%15%2012%' OR date = 'August 15, 2012')
  AND result ILIKE '%win%';

Result:
[{"venue":"baku , azerbaijan","contains_baku":true}]

Interpretation:
- The row for August 15, 2012 has result = "win" and venue = "baku , azerbaijan". The venue string indeed contains "Baku" (case-insensitive), satisfying the claim that the winning match on that date was played at a Baku venue.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the match records contained in the table public.branimir_suba_i.
- Date matching is case-insensitive and pattern-based because dates are stored as free text.
- "Baku venue" means the venue field contains the city name "Baku" (case-insensitive).
