Claim interpreted: “Two of the projects were proposed and listed during 1993, but were never completed.” I verify this against the available data.

Data discovery
- Source discovered: PostgreSQL database TabFact (postgres_tabfact1), schema public.
- Only table available: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (Superfund sites in Mississippi).

Schema (from the database)
- Columns (all text): cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted.

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Understand the meaning/population of “construction completed”
- SQL:
SELECT "construction completed", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE "construction completed" IS NOT NULL
  AND trim("construction completed") <> ''
GROUP BY "construction completed"
ORDER BY count DESC, "construction completed";
- Result highlights: "-": 6; "08 / 08 / 1997": 1; "09 / 17 / 1993": 1; "12 / 30 / 1982": 1.
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_or_empty_count
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE "construction completed" IS NULL OR trim("construction completed") = '' ;
- Result: 0.
Interpretation: “-” is used to indicate no construction completion date (i.e., not completed) for 6 sites.

2) Identify 1993 entries for proposed and listed
- SQL:
SELECT proposed, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
GROUP BY proposed
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST;
- Proposed values include two in 1993: 05 / 10 / 1993 and 06 / 23 / 1993 (each once).
- SQL:
SELECT listed, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
GROUP BY listed
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST;
- Listed values: two rows are "-" and none show 1993.
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT proposed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: 05 / 10 / 1993; 06 / 23 / 1993.
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_proposed_1993 FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: 2.
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT listed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE listed LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: none.
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_listed_1993 FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE listed LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: 0.

3) The specific rows proposed in 1993 and their listed/completion status
- SQL:
SELECT "cerclis id", name, county, proposed, listed
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%';
- Results (2 rows):
  - msd008154486, chemfax , inc, harrison, proposed: 06 / 23 / 1993, listed: -
  - msd056029648, potter co, copiah, proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993, listed: -
- SQL:
SELECT name, proposed, listed, "construction completed" 
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%';
- Results:
  - chemfax , inc — proposed: 06 / 23 / 1993; listed: -; construction completed: -
  - potter co — proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993; listed: -; construction completed: -

4) Direct test of “proposed in 1993 AND listed in 1993”
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE "proposed" LIKE '%1993%' AND "listed" LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: 0.
- SQL:
SELECT "cerclis id", "name", "county", "proposed", "listed", "construction completed", "partially deleted", "deleted" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE "proposed" LIKE '%1993%' AND "listed" LIKE '%1993%';
- Result: no rows.

5) Count of projects proposed in 1993 and never completed
- SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%'
  AND "construction completed" = '-';
- Result: 2.
- SQL:
SELECT "name", "listed", proposed, "construction completed"
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE proposed LIKE '%1993%'
  AND "construction completed" = '-';
- Results confirm both have listed = '-' (not listed) and construction completed = '-'.

Findings
- True: There are exactly 2 projects proposed in 1993 that were never completed (construction completed = “-”).
- False: None of the projects were listed in 1993; in fact, the two 1993-proposed sites were not listed at all (listed = “-”).

Conclusion
- The claim that “2 of the project [were] proposed and listed during 1993, but [were] never complete” is not supported as stated. The correct statement is: Two projects were proposed in 1993 and were never completed, but they were not listed in 1993 (nor listed at all in this dataset).

Assumptions made
- “Project” refers to rows in public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (Superfund sites in Mississippi).
- “-” in date fields denotes “no date” (e.g., not listed / not completed).
- “During 1993” interpreted as the text field containing the substring “1993”.
