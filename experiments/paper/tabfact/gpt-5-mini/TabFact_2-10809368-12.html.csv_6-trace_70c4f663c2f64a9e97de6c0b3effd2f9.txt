Claim to verify: "on 13 july 1946, the home team score 14.8 (92)"

Data sources checked
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1946_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date")

Method
1) Confirmed how dates are stored in the table.
2) Retrieved all matches on 13 July 1946 and inspected the home team scores.

Executed SQL (verbatim)
- Query 1 (confirm stored date format):
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season WHERE date ILIKE '%13%July%1946%' OR date ILIKE '%13 July 1946%';

- Query 2 (retrieve matches on that date):
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season WHERE date = '13 july 1946';

Results from Query 2 (date — home team — home team score vs away team — away team score — venue)
- 13 july 1946 — geelong — 15.7 (97) vs melbourne — 21.14 (140) — kardinia park
