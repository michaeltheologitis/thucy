Claim to verify
- For call signs W290AG and W282AE: ERP (in watts) = 27 and FCC class = D for both; one is licensed to Macon, Georgia and the other to Griffin, Georgia.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact7)
- Relevant table: public.wyfk with columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (text), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text)

Evidence
1) Checked table size
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.wyfk;
Result:
[{"count":5}]

2) Inspected rows to understand call sign capitalization and available fields
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "fcc info" FROM public.wyfk ORDER BY "call sign" LIMIT 10;
Result:
[{"call sign":"w230av","city of license":"gadsden , alabama","class":"d","erp w":10,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":"93.9 fm"},
 {"call sign":"w269ax","city of license":"anniston , alabama","class":"d","erp w":10,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":"101.7 fm"},
 {"call sign":"w273ae","city of license":"albany , georgia","class":"d","erp w":55,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":"102.5 fm"},
 {"call sign":"w282ae","city of license":"macon , georgia","class":"d","erp w":27,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":"104.3 fm"},
 {"call sign":"w290ag","city of license":"griffin , georgia","class":"d","erp w":27,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":"105.9 fm"}]

3) Queried the two specific call signs
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", "erp w", "class", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w290ag','w282ae') ORDER BY lower("call sign");
Result:
[{"call sign":"w282ae","city of license":"macon , georgia","class":"d","erp w":27},
 {"call sign":"w290ag","city of license":"griffin , georgia","class":"d","erp w":27}]

Assessment of the claim
- ERP for W282AE: 27 W — matches the claim.
- ERP for W290AG: 27 W — matches the claim.
- Class for W282AE: D — matches the claim.
- Class for W290AG: D — matches the claim.
- City of license for W282AE: Macon, Georgia — matches the claim (stored as "macon , georgia" in the data).
- City of license for W290AG: Griffin, Georgia — matches the claim (stored as "griffin , georgia" in the data).

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "erp w" as effective radiated power in watts.
- Treated call signs case-insensitively because they are stored in lowercase in the table.
- Interpreted the phrasing "1 have a city of license of ... and the other ..." as W282AE = Macon, GA and W290AG = Griffin, GA, consistent with the queried results.
