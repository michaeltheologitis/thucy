Claim to verify: “in 2006, glo mobile have 11000 growth 52”.

Summary conclusion:
- The 2006 figure of 11,000 (thousands) subscribers for Glo Mobile is supported by the data (i.e., 11 million subscribers in 2006 for Nigeria).
- The growth figure is not 52; the table records growth as 22%, which also matches the calculation from 2005 to 2006.

Data source consulted:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: mobile_telephony_in_africa
- Relevant columns: provider, country, subscribers (2005) (thousands), subscribers (2006) (thousands), growth %

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Find providers containing “glo” and show 2006 subscribers and growth
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %" 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE lower(provider) LIKE '%glo%';
Result:
- provider: glo mobile; country: nigeria; subscribers (2006) (thousands): 11000; growth %: 22

2) Retrieve the full row for Glo Mobile
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE 'glo mobile';
Result:
- provider: glo mobile
- country: nigeria
- subscribers (2005) (thousands): 9000
- subscribers (2006) (thousands): 11000
- growth %: 22

3) Independently compute the growth from 2005 to 2006 and compare to stored growth
SQL:
SELECT provider,
       "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" AS subs_2005,
       "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" AS subs_2006,
       "growth %" AS stored_growth,
       CASE WHEN "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" = 0 THEN NULL
            ELSE (( ("subscribers (2006) (thousands)"::double precision - "subscribers (2005) (thousands)"::double precision)
                   / "subscribers (2005) (thousands)"::double precision) * 100)
       END AS computed_growth
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE lower(provider) = 'glo mobile';
Result:
- subs_2005: 9000; subs_2006: 11000; stored_growth: 22; computed_growth: 22.22222222222222
Interpretation: The stored 22% aligns with the computed ≈22.22% (minor rounding difference); not 52%.

Optional schema confirmation used during verification
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='mobile_telephony_in_africa' AND table_schema='public';
Result (abridged):
- provider (text); country (text); subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint); subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint); growth % (double precision)

Conclusion:
- True: In 2006, Glo Mobile (Nigeria) had 11,000 (thousands) subscribers (11 million).
- False: The growth figure is not 52; it is recorded as 22% (≈22.22% by calculation).

Assumptions made:
- “11000” refers to the “subscribers (2006) (thousands)” field (i.e., 11,000 thousands = 11 million).
- “growth 52” refers to the growth percentage from 2005 to 2006.
- “Glo Mobile” refers to the provider entry “glo mobile” in Nigeria within the mobile_telephony_in_africa table.
