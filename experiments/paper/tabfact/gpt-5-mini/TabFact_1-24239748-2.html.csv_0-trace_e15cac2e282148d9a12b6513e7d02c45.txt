Claim interpreted: “exports (US mil) equals 6270.2 when the country list is ‘vest’.” I interpret “country list” as referring to the table’s county column and the entry named “Vest”.

Data source consulted: postgres_tabfact12, public schema, table: public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (columns: county; exports (us mil); percent of total exports; imports (us mil); percent of total imports).

Evidence:
1) Retrieve the exports (us mil) for county = 'Vest' (case-insensitive)
- Result: county = vest; exports (us mil) = 6270.2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, "exports (us mil)" 
  FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
  WHERE lower(county) = lower('Vest');

2) Confirm uniqueness of the 'Vest' row
- Result: 1 row
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_vest 
  FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
  WHERE lower(county) = 'vest';

Assessment: The data shows that for county = “Vest,” the value of "exports (us mil)" is 6270.2, and there is exactly one such row. This supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions:
- “country list” refers to the county field in the table and the specific entry “Vest.”
- Matching on county name is case-insensitive (the stored value appears as “vest”).
