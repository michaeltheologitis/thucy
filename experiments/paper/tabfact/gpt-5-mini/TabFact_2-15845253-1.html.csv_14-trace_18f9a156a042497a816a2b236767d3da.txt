Claim to verify: “7 viral family have a icosahedral virion shape.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: viral_disease with columns [family, baltimore group, envelopment, virion shape, replication site]

Step 1: Inspect distinct values of virion shape
Executed SQL:
SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM viral_disease
GROUP BY "virion shape"
ORDER BY "virion shape";

Result (distinct values and row counts):
- complex: 2
- helical: 6
- helical , bullet shaped: 1
- icosahedral: 13
- spherical: 1

Step 2: List distinct virus families with virion shape = 'icosahedral'
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "family" FROM viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral' ORDER BY "family";

Resulting families (13 total):
- adenoviridae
- astroviridae
- caliciviridae
- flaviviridae
- hepadnaviridae
- hepeviridae
- papillomaviridae
- parvoviridae
- picornaviridae
- polyomaviridae
- reoviridae
- retroviridae
- togaviridae

Step 3: Count distinct families with virion shape = 'icosahedral'
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS distinct_family_count FROM viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';

Result:
- distinct_family_count = 13

Step 4 (robustness check): Case-insensitive substring match for 'icosahed'
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS matching_row_count
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%icosahed%';

Result:
- matching_row_count = 13

Executed SQL (distinct values of 'virion shape' among matches):
SELECT DISTINCT "virion shape" AS virion_shape
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%icosahed%'
ORDER BY "virion shape";

Result:
- virion_shape = icosahedral

Conclusion
- The TabFact viral_disease table shows 13 distinct virus families with an icosahedral virion shape, not 7. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data available in this environment.

Assumptions
- “viral family” refers to the values in the family column of the viral_disease table.
- “icosahedral virion shape” corresponds directly to the value 'icosahedral' in the virion shape column.
- Counts are based on distinct family names in this table; the table appears to include one row per family in this subset, as the row count and distinct family count both equal 13 for icosahedral.
- This verification is grounded strictly in the accessible TabFact database; if another source defines families or shapes differently, results could differ, but we treat the accessible data as authoritative per instructions.
