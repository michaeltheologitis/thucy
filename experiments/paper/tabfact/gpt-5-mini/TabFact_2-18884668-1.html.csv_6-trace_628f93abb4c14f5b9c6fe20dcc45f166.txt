Summary
- Core relationship: Supported. In the papal_election_1119 dataset, the elector “john of crema” has elevator “paschal ii.”
- Date detail: Not supported for circa 1106. The same record shows his elevation as “circa 1117,” not 1106. Other electors elevated circa 1106 by Paschal II exist, but none are indicated as being “of Crema” (or Cremona) in this table.

Data source discovery
- Verified accessible data asset: PostgreSQL database (TabFact), public schema.

Schema check
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='papal_election_1119';

Confirmed columns: elector, nationality, cardinalatial order and title, elevated, elevator.

Evidence 1: Electors elevated circa 1106 by Paschal II
SQL executed:
SELECT elector, elevated, elevator, "cardinalatial order and title"
FROM public.papal_election_1119
WHERE elevated ILIKE '%1106%' AND elevator ILIKE '%Paschal II%';

Results:
- elector: pietro pierleoni | elevated: ca 1106 - 1116 | elevator: paschal ii | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of ss cosma e damiano
- elector: roscemanno sanseverino , osbcas | elevated: circa 1106 | elevator: paschal ii | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of s giorgio in velabro

Interpretation: Paschal II did elevate some electors around 1106, but these records do not mention Crema/Cremona.

Evidence 2: Any elector “of Crema” or “of Cremona”
SQL executed:
SELECT elector, elevated, elevator, "cardinalatial order and title"
FROM public.papal_election_1119
WHERE elector ILIKE '%crema%' OR elector ILIKE '%cremona%'
   OR "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%crema%'
   OR "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%cremona%';

Result:
- elector: john of crema | elevated: circa 1117 | elevator: paschal ii | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s crisogono

Interpretation: The elector explicitly identified as “of Crema” was elevated by Paschal II, but the elevation date is circa 1117, not 1106.

Conclusion
- True: Paschal II was the “elevator” (pope who created the cardinal) for the elector from Crema (John of Crema).
- False/unsupported detail: The timing “circa 1106” does not match; the dataset shows “circa 1117.”

Assumptions
- “cream” was interpreted as the Lombard city “Crema.”
- “elector” refers to a cardinal-elector in the papal election of 1119.
- “elevator” refers to the pope who created the cardinal, as per the column heading in the dataset.
