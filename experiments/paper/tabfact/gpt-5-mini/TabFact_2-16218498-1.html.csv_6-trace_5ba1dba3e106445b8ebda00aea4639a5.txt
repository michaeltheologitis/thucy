Schema evidence
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Result: Table t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs with match legs and aggregate scores, suitable for verifying the claim.

Evidence query 1: Locate the two ties and view their legs and aggregate
- Exact SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Port Autonome%'
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Port Autonome%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Praia%'
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Praia%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%LPRC Oilers%'
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%LPRC Oilers%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Mighty Blackpool%'
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Mighty Blackpool%';
- Result rows:
  - lprc oilers | mighty blackpool | 1 - 0 | 1 - 3 | 2 - 3
  - port autonome | sporting clube da praia | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0 (1 - 3)

Evidence query 2: Compute total goals across both legs for each tie
- Exact SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg",
       (CAST(trim(split_part("1st leg", '-', 1)) AS INTEGER) + CAST(trim(split_part("1st leg", '-', 2)) AS INTEGER)
        + CAST(trim(split_part("2nd leg", '-', 1)) AS INTEGER) + CAST(trim(split_part("2nd leg", '-', 2)) AS INTEGER))
       AS total_goals
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%port autonome%' AND LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%sporting%')
   OR (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%sporting%' AND LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%port autonome%')
   OR (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%lprc oilers%' AND LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%mighty blackpool%')
   OR (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%mighty blackpool%' AND LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%lprc oilers%');
- Computed totals:
  - lprc oilers vs mighty blackpool: total_goals = 5 (legs 1-0 and 1-3)
  - port autonome vs sporting clube da praia: total_goals = 0 (legs 0-0 and 0-0)

Analysis
- The Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia tie had 0 total goals across both legs.
- The LPRC Oilers vs Mighty Blackpool tie had 5 total goals across both legs.
- Therefore, Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia did not have a higher score; it had a lower score compared to LPRC Oilers vs Mighty Blackpool.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to the number of goals scored in regulation across both legs, not the penalty shootout indicated in parentheses in the aggregate (e.g., “0 - 0 (1 - 3)”).
- The matches referenced are those in the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs, as per the available table. Team name matching was case-insensitive and substring-based to account for minor naming variations.
