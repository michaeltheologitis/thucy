Claim being verified: “AT90S1200 is the chip with the smallest frequency of more than 12 MHz.”

Summary of findings:
- The available data contains no chips with frequency strictly greater than 12.
- The chip AT90S1200 does not appear in the dataset.
- Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Check if any chip has frequency > 12 and find the smallest such frequency
SQL:
SELECT MIN(frequency) AS min_freq_gt_12 FROM my_info_table WHERE frequency > 12;
Result:
{"min_freq_gt_12": null}

2) Confirm there are zero rows with frequency > 12
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_freq_gt_12 FROM my_info_table WHERE frequency > 12;
Result:
{"cnt_freq_gt_12": 0}

3) Look up AT90S1200 in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_at90s1200 FROM my_info_table WHERE chip = 'AT90S1200';
Result:
{"cnt_at90s1200": 0}

Conclusion:
- There are no chips with frequency > 12 in the table, so no chip can be identified as having the smallest such frequency.
- The dataset contains no entry for AT90S1200.
- The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions:
- “Frequency” is stored in MHz as an integer in the frequency column and “more than 12 MHz” means strictly greater than 12.
- Exact string match was used for the chip name; case-insensitive or partial matching would not change the outcome given the absence of any AT90S1200 row.
