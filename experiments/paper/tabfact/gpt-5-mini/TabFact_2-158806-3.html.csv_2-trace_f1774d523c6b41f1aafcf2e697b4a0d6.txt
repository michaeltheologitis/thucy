Summary
- What’s true: The coin whose equivalence is 0.60 has a diameter of 24.5 mm.
- What’s false: That coin’s face value is not less than 100 ₧; it is exactly 100 ₧.

Evidence from the data
1) Full table inspection
Executed SQL:
SELECT value, equiv, diameter, weight, composition FROM public.peseta;

Key returned rows (value | equiv | diameter | weight | composition):
- 100 ₧ | 0.60 | 24.5 mm | 9.25 g | aluminium bronze
(Among others: 1 ₧, 5 ₧, 10 ₧, 25 ₧, 50 ₧, 200 ₧, 500 ₧ with their respective equiv and diameters.)

2) Direct check for equivalence = 0.60
Executed SQL:
SELECT value, diameter FROM public.peseta WHERE trim(equiv) = '0.60';

Result:
- value: 100 ₧, diameter: 24.5 mm

3) Direct check for diameter = 24.5 mm
Executed SQL:
SELECT value, equiv FROM public.peseta WHERE diameter = '24.5 mm';

Result:
- value: 100 ₧, equiv: 0.60

Conclusion
- The coin with equivalence 0.60 indeed has a 24.5 mm diameter.
- However, its face value is 100 ₧, not less than 100 ₧. Therefore, the claim combines a correct diameter with an incorrect value condition.

Assumptions
- “Equivalence of 0.60” refers to the equiv column (e.g., euro-equivalent proportion) in the public.peseta table.
- “Value” refers to the coin’s face value in pesetas as shown in the value column, which includes the ₧ symbol.
