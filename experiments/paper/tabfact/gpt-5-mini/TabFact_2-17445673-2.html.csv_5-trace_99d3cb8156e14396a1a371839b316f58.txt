Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact, schema: public) with a single table: public.tim_lajcik. Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text).

Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret the claim as: “Two matches resulted in a draw.” Given the available data, this refers to draws recorded in the tim_lajcik table.

Evidence from the data
1) Distinct result types and their counts
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, count(*) AS cnt
  FROM tim_lajcik
  GROUP BY res
  ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST;
- Result:
  win = 7
  loss = 6
  draw = 1
- Interpretation: The table records only one draw.

2) Explicit count of draws
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS draw_count
  FROM tim_lajcik
  WHERE res = 'draw';
- Result:
  draw_count = 1
- Interpretation: Confirms there is exactly one draw.

3) Details of the draw fight(s)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  WHERE res = 'draw';
- Result:
  opponent: ron waterman; event: ufc 22; method: draw; round: 3; time: 5:00
- Interpretation: Only a single fight is recorded as a draw in the dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim that there are two matches resulting in a draw is not supported by the available data. The dataset shows exactly one draw.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the fights recorded in the public.tim_lajcik table (the only available dataset). The res column’s literal value 'draw' denotes a draw. If the claim intended a different athlete, dataset, or scope, that information is not present in the accessible data; verification is therefore based solely on this database.
