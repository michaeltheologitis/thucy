Summary
- I checked the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season game log table available in the connected data source. The claim appears to assert that there was a game where Austin Daye was the high rebounder with 16 rebounds, and that the Pistons’ record after that game was 2–4. The data do not support this.

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact13 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season

Table structure confirmation
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result (ordered): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence 1: Does any game list Austin Daye as high rebounder with 16?
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" ILIKE '%austin daye (16)%';
Result:
match_count = 0
Interpretation: No game has "high rebounds" containing "austin daye (16)".

Evidence 2: All games where Austin Daye is the high rebounder (any value)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "high rebounds", record
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" ILIKE '%austin daye%';
Results:
- game 2 | date: october 8 | team: milwaukee | high rebounds: austin daye (7) | record: 1 - 1
- game 5 | date: october 15 | team: minnesota | high rebounds: austin daye (11) | record: 2 - 3
Interpretation: The highest listed for Daye as high rebounder is 11, not 16.

Evidence 3: The game when the Pistons’ record became 2 - 4
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team AS opponent, record, "high rebounds", "high points"
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE record = '2 - 4';
Result:
- game: 6 | date: october 16 | opponent: charlotte | record: 2 - 4 | high rebounds: greg monroe (8) | high points: rodney stuckey (25)
Interpretation: At 2–4, the high rebounder was Greg Monroe (8), not Austin Daye.

Evidence 4: Potential source of confusion — Austin Daye with 16 points (not rebounds)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "high points", "high rebounds", record
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE lower("high points") LIKE '%austin daye (16)%';
Result:
- game: 4 | date: october 13 | team: dallas | high points: austin daye (16) | high rebounds: ben wallace , jason maxiell (8) | record: 2 - 2
Interpretation: Austin Daye had 16 points as the team’s high scorer in game 4; he was not the high rebounder, and the record after that game was 2–2.

Conclusion
- The data show no game where Austin Daye was the high rebounder with 16 rebounds. When the Pistons’ record was 2–4 (game 6), the high rebounder was Greg Monroe with 8 rebounds. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “There exists a game in the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season where Austin Daye was the high rebounder with 16 rebounds, and the team’s record after that game was 2–4.”
- Treated the table field “team” as the opponent and “record” as the Pistons’ cumulative record after each game.
