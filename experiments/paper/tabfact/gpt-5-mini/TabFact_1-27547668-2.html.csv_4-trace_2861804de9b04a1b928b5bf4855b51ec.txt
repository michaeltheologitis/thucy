Claim to verify: “mike clattenburg direct one more episode than steve scaini.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (episode list for the TV show “Republic of Doyle”), with a “directed by” column containing director names.

Evidence collected
1) Count episodes directed by Mike Clattenburg and Steve Scaini
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS mike_clattenburg_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%mike clattenburg%';
  Result: {"mike_clattenburg_count": 2}

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS steve_scaini_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%steve scaini%';
  Result: {"steve_scaini_count": 1}

- Supporting inspection of exact strings in the data:
  SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "directed by" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%clattenburg%' ORDER BY "directed by";
  Result: {"directed by": "mike clattenburg"}

  SELECT DISTINCT "directed by" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%scaini%' ORDER BY "directed by";
  Result: {"directed by": "steve scaini"}

2) List the episode titles for transparency
- SQL executed:
  SELECT title FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Mike Clattenburg%';
  Results:
  - fathers and sons
  - duchess of george

  SELECT title FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Steve Scaini%';
  Results:

Analysis
- Within the Republic of Doyle episodes data, Mike Clattenburg directed 2 episodes, while Steve Scaini directed 1 episode. The difference is exactly one episode, matching the claim.

Conclusion
- The evidence supports the statement in the context of the available dataset.

Assumptions
