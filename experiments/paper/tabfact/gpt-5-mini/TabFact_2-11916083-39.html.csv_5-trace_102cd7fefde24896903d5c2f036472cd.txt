Summary
Claim interpreted: “The artist associated with a mintage of 41828 is Bonnie Ross.” I verified this by querying the Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (2000s) table for a normalized mintage of 41828 and by separately checking entries for artist Bonnie Ross.

Evidence 1: Row(s) with normalized mintage = 41828
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage, "issue price"
  FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
  WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace(mintage, '\\D', '', 'g'), '') = '41828';
- Result:
  year: 2001 | theme: the russell light four | artist: john mardon | mintage: 41828 | issue price: 59.95
- Conclusion from Evidence 1: The coin with mintage 41828 is credited to artist John Mardon, not Bonnie Ross.

Evidence 2: Entries for artist “Bonnie Ross” (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage, "issue price" FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE lower(artist) LIKE '%bonnie ross%' ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  year: 2002 | theme: the william lawrence | artist: bonnie ross | mintage: included in the gray - dort | issue price: 59.95
- Conclusion from Evidence 2: The dataset contains an entry for Bonnie Ross, but its mintage field is non-numeric text (“included in the gray - dort”) and does not match 41828. There is no indication that Bonnie Ross is associated with mintage 41828.

Overall conclusion
- The artist for the coin with mintage 41828 is John Mardon, not Bonnie Ross. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Normalization of mintage values was done by removing all non-digit characters before comparison. The analysis is confined to the available “royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s” table in the TabFact database, which is treated as authoritative per the instructions.
