Claim being checked: "season 6.0 have q245 as its format"

Summary conclusion: Inaccurate. In the available data, season 6 has format q145, and there are zero rows where season 6 has format q245.

Data source discovery:
- Connected database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), schema: public
- Relevant table: my_info_table

Schema details used:
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), season (bigint), format (text), title (text), "original airdate" (text)
  - No primary key

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) What formats exist for season 6 (including potential variants like 6.0)?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT format
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE season::text ~ '^\s*6(\.0+)?\s*$'
  ORDER BY format;
- Result:
  - q145
- Interpretation: The only format recorded for season 6 is q145; no q245 is present.

2) Are there any rows where season is 6 (or 6.0 variants) AND format = 'q245'?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_q245_season6
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE (CAST(season AS text) ~ '^6(\.0+)?$')
    AND lower(trim(format)) = 'q245';
- Result:
  {"count_q245_season6": 0}
- Interpretation: There are zero entries where season 6 has format q245.

3) List the rows for season 6 to show the actual format values alongside titles/episodes.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, title, format, season
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE CAST(season AS text) ~ '^6(\.0+)?$'
  ORDER BY episode;
- Rows returned:
  - episode: 222; title: denisa 's greedy doll / denisa 's slumber party; format: q145; season: 6
- Interpretation: The recorded format for the season 6 row is q145.

Overall assessment: The data directly contradicts the claim. Season 6 (including treating "6.0" as 6) does not have format q245; it has format q145.

Assumptions made (due to brevity/ambiguity of the claim):
- "season 6.0" was interpreted as season 6; since season is stored as bigint, textual variants (e.g., 6.0) would still conceptually map to season 6. Queries allowed for such variants by casting to text and using a regex.
- "format" refers to the 'format' column in public.my_info_table.
- String comparison for 'q245' was case-insensitive and trimmed to avoid mismatches due to whitespace or case.
