Summary:
- Claim: “Datia’s constituency number is lower than Gohad’s by 10.”
- Finding: According to the available constituency data, Datia’s number is 22 and Gohad’s is 13. Datia is not lower than Gohad by 10; it is higher by 9. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Data source discovery:
- Tool used: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL source (postgres_tabfact7) with a public table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency, containing constituency names and numbers.

Schema inspection:
- Tool used: schema_query
- Table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  - Columns: "constituency number" (text), "name" (text), "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" (text), "district" (text), "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence queries and results (exact SQL shown):
1) Retrieve entries for Datia and Gohad
SQL executed:
SELECT "name", "constituency number", "district" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE lower("name") IN ('datia','gohad');
Results:
- Gohad — constituency number: 13; district: bhind
- Datia — constituency number: 22; district: datia

2) Independently fetch each and compute difference
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name ILIKE '%Datia%';
Result: [{"constituency number":"22","name":"datia"}]

SQL executed:
SELECT name, "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name ILIKE '%Gohad%';
Result: [{"constituency number":"13","name":"gohad"}]

SQL executed:
SELECT CAST(d."constituency number" AS integer) - CAST(g."constituency number" AS integer) AS difference
FROM (SELECT "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name ILIKE 'datia') d
CROSS JOIN (SELECT "constituency number" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name ILIKE 'gohad') g;
Result: [{"difference":9}]

Assessment of the claim:
- The claim requires: Datia = Gohad − 10.
- Observed: Datia = 22, Gohad = 13. Therefore, Gohad − Datia = −9, not 10. Datia is higher than Gohad by 9, so the claim is false.

Assumptions:
- “Constituency number” refers to the number provided in the public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table’s "constituency number" field for the entries named “datia” and “gohad”.
- Name matching is case-insensitive and matches the exact constituency names in the dataset.
