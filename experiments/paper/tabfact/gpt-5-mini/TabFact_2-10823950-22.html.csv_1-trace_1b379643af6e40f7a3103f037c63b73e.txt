Summary
- Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL database, table public.t_1981_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date"). This table appears to contain match-level records for the 1981 VFL season, including crowd (attendance) figures.

Evidence and SQL
1) Retrieve all matches where the away team is Melbourne (case-insensitive exact match) and show the key fields:
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "venue", "crowd"
FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE lower("away team") = 'melbourne';
Result:
- date: 29 august 1981; home team: hawthorn; away team: melbourne; venue: princes park; crowd: 7912

2) Confirm the count of such matches and the distinct crowd values:
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE lower("away team") = 'melbourne';
Result: match_count = 1

SQL (distinct crowds):
SELECT DISTINCT crowd
FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE lower("away team") = 'melbourne'
ORDER BY crowd;
Result: 7912

Conclusion
- Within this dataset, the only match where Melbourne were the away team has a recorded crowd of 7,912. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "Melbourne" refers to the Melbourne Football Club and not "North Melbourne"; the match criterion was lower("away team") = 'melbourne' (exact name match, case-insensitive).
- Verification is constrained to the available dataset (1981 VFL season table).
