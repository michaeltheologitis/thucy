Claim to verify: The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Athletics.

Conclusion: The lowest-attendance May game was NOT against the Athletics; it was against the Royals on May 3, with 20,809 attendees.

Evidence from database queries:
1) Find the minimum May attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date LIKE 'may %';
Result:
min_attendance = 20809

2) Identify the May game(s) with that minimum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date LIKE 'may %' AND attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date LIKE 'may %') ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: may 3, opponent: royals, attendance: 20809

3) Cross-check: list all May games ordered by attendance ascending
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date LIKE 'may %'
ORDER BY attendance ASC;
Results excerpt (lowest to higher):
- may 3 — royals — 20809
- may 5 — royals — 22588
- may 4 — royals — 22628
- may 21 — athletics — 22738
- may 2 — royals — 22896
(...additional rows omitted for brevity...)

Assessment of the claim:
- Opponent for the lowest-attendance May game: Royals (not Athletics). This contradicts the claim.
- Athletics games in May appear with higher attendance values (e.g., 22,738; 24,631; 34,028; and several 50k+), none equal to the minimum.

Assumptions made:
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season represents the 1991 season and stores dates as lowercase month names followed by the day number (e.g., 'may 3'). Filtering used date LIKE 'may %', which matches the observed format.
