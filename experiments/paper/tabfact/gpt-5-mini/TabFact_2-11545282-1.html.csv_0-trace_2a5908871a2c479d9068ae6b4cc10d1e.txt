Interpretation
- Within the available Utah Jazz roster data, there are 6 entries where nationality equals “united states,” matching the claim’s numeric assertion.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Data scope: The only accessible table is public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster, which contains 9 rows and appears to be a partial “all-time roster” sample (not a current-season roster). The claim was interpreted against this dataset because no other Jazz roster source was available.
- Nationality matching: Exact text match to ‘united states’ (lowercase) as stored in the table.
