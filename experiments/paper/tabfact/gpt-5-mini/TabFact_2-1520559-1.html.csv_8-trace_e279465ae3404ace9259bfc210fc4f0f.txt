Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Jiyai Shin won the 2010 Open by beating Inbee Park with a 9-stroke margin. I interpret “Open” as the Women’s British Open and “jiyal shin” as Jiyai Shin.

Data source: postgres_tabfact16 (TabFact) public schema, table: women_s_british_open.

Evidence 1 — 2010 Women’s British Open record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up", "margin of victory" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year = 2010;
- Result:
  Year: 2010; Champion: Yani Tseng; Runner(s)-up: Katherine Hull; Margin of victory: 1 stroke.
- Interpretation: In 2010, the champion was Yani Tseng, not Jiyai Shin, and the runner-up was Katherine Hull, not Inbee Park. The margin of victory was 1 stroke, not 9.

Evidence 2 — All Women’s British Open wins by Jiyai Shin
- Executed SQL (to confirm where Jiyai Shin appears):
  SELECT year, champion FROM women_s_british_open WHERE champion ILIKE '%Jiyai%';
- Returned:
  {champion: jiyai shin, year: 2012}, {champion: jiyai shin, year: 2008}
- Executed SQL (details for those years):
  SELECT year, "runner (s) - up", "margin of victory" FROM women_s_british_open WHERE champion ILIKE 'jiyai shin' ORDER BY year;
- Returned:
  2008 — runner(s)-up: yani tseng; margin of victory: 3 strokes
  2012 — runner(s)-up: inbee park; margin of victory: 9 strokes
- Interpretation: Jiyai Shin’s wins occurred in 2008 and 2012. In 2012, she beat Inbee Park by 9 strokes.

Evidence 3 — 2012 Women’s British Open record (direct confirmation)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up", "margin of victory" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year = 2012;
- Result:
  { year: 2012, champion: jiyai shin, "runner (s) - up": inbee park, "margin of victory": 9 strokes }
- Interpretation: Confirms that the 9-stroke win over Inbee Park happened in 2012, not 2010.

Conclusion: The claim is incorrect for the year 2010. While Jiyai Shin did defeat Inbee Park by 9 strokes at the Women’s British Open, that occurred in 2012. In 2010, Yani Tseng won by 1 stroke over Katherine Hull.

Assumptions made:
- “Open” refers to the Women’s British Open.
- “jiyal shin” refers to Jiyai Shin.
- “9 stroke” refers to the margin of victory.
