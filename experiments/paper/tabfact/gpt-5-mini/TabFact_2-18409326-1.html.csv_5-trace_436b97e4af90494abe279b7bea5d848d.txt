Claim to verify: “Vista Broadcast Group’s radio station plays adult hits.”

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool finding: One accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a single table: media_in_kelowna.

Step 2: Understand the schema
- Table: public.media_in_kelowna
- Columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text)

Step 3: Collect evidence from the data
A) Query targeting Adult Hits format owned by Vista Broadcast Group
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner
  FROM public.media_in_kelowna
  WHERE owner ILIKE '%vista%'
    AND format ILIKE '%adult hits%';
- Result (1 row):
  • frequency: 0 103.9 fm
  • call sign: cjui - fm
  • branding: 103.9 the juice
  • format: adult hits
  • owner: vista broadcast group

B) Query to list all Vista-owned records for confirmation

  SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%vista%';
- Result (1 row):
  • frequency: 0 103.9 fm
  • call sign: cjui - fm
  • branding: 103.9 the juice
  • format: adult hits
  • owner: vista broadcast group

Assessment
- The dataset shows a radio station owned by Vista Broadcast Group (CJUI-FM, branded “103.9 The Juice”) with a “adult hits” format. This directly supports the claim that a Vista Broadcast Group radio station plays Adult Hits.

Conclusion
- The evidence from the available authoritative dataset confirms the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing “play adult hit” as “broadcasts an Adult Hits music format.”
- Verification is based on the available media_in_kelowna dataset; it confirms at least one Vista Broadcast Group station with an Adult Hits format within this dataset.
