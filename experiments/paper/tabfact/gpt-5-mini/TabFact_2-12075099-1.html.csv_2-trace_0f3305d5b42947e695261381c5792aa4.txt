Claim interpreted: “Cannons be the opponent on July 14 at Bishop Kearney Field.” I verify this against the 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season table.

Data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL) public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season

Key evidence from the database
1) Full schedule overview (to understand date/opponent/field values)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season;
Result excerpt (date | opponent | field):
- may 29 | cannons   | villanova stadium
- june 30 | cannons  | nickerson field
- july 9 | rattlers  | bishop kearney field
- july 14 | rattlers | villanova stadium
- july 23 | cannons  | nickerson field

2) What happened on July 14?
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, field FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season WHERE date ILIKE '%July 14%';
Result:
- date: july 14 | opponent: rattlers | field: villanova stadium
Interpretation: On July 14, the opponent was the Rattlers, and the venue was Villanova Stadium (home), not Bishop Kearney Field.

3) Games at Bishop Kearney Field
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season WHERE field = 'bishop kearney field' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: july 9 | opponent: rattlers
Interpretation: The only listed game at Bishop Kearney Field was on July 9 vs the Rattlers, not the Cannons.

4) All appearances of Cannons in the schedule
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, field, "home / away", result FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%cannon%';
Results:
- may 29 | cannons | villanova stadium | home | l 12 - 13
- june 30 | cannons | nickerson field | away | w 15 - 14
- july 23 | cannons | nickerson field | away | l 10 - 11
Interpretation: Cannons appear on May 29 (Villanova Stadium), June 30 (Nickerson Field), and July 23 (Nickerson Field). They do not appear on July 14 or at Bishop Kearney Field.

Conclusion
- The data shows that on July 14, the Barrage played the Rattlers at Villanova Stadium.
- The only game at Bishop Kearney Field was on July 9 vs the Rattlers.
- Therefore, “Cannons” were not the opponent on July 14 at Bishop Kearney Field.

Assumptions
- “cannon” refers to the Boston Cannons (stored as “cannons” in the table).
- Dates in this table are for the 2005 season and are stored as text without the year.
- Verification is confined to the provided 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season table, treated as authoritative for this context.
