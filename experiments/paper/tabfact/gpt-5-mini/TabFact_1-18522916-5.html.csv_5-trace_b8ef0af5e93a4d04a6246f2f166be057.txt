Claim interpreted: “Mauricio Cienfuegos was sacked on 25 August 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25). Relevant table identified: public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008, which records managerial changes for the Primera División de Fútbol Profesional Apertura 2008 (team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replacement, etc.).

Evidence collected
1) Check whether Mauricio Cienfuegos appears as an outgoing manager and retrieve details.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM "public"."primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008" WHERE LOWER("outgoing manager") LIKE '%cienfuegos%';
Result (1 row):
- team: nejapa
- outgoing manager: mauricio cienfuegos
- manner of departure: mutual consent
- date of vacancy: 14 august 2008
- replaced by: daniel uberti
- date of appointment: 5 september 2008
- position in table: 10th

Finding: Mauricio Cienfuegos left Nejapa on 14 August 2008 by mutual consent (not sacked), per this table.

2) Check if anyone was sacked on 25 August 2008.
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "outgoing manager", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy"
FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
WHERE "date of vacancy" ILIKE '%25 august 2008%';
Result (1 row):
- team: firpo
- outgoing manager: gerardo reinoso
- manner of departure: sacked
- date of vacancy: 25 august 2008

Finding: On 25 August 2008, Gerardo Reinoso (Firpo) was sacked. This date does not correspond to Mauricio Cienfuegos.

Conclusion
- The data shows Mauricio Cienfuegos departed on 14 August 2008 by mutual consent, not sacked, and not on 25 August 2008. The 25 August 2008 sacking pertains to Gerardo Reinoso of Firpo. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing to mean: “Mauricio Cienfuegos was sacked on 25 August 2008.”
- Treated the identified table as the authoritative record of managerial changes for the 2008 Apertura in El Salvador’s top division.
