Claim to verify: "the export be 6270.2 when the country be vest with a 13.8 percent of total export"

Data source consulted
- TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema
- Table: public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (columns: county, exports (us mil), percent of total exports, imports (us mil), percent of total imports)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial lookup for a county similar to "vest" and any exact 13.8% entry
SQL:
SELECT county, "exports (us mil)", "percent of total exports"
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
WHERE county ILIKE '%vest%'
   OR "percent of total exports" = '13.8%'
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- county: vest | exports (us mil):  6270.2 | percent of total exports: 15.0 %

2) Exact row for county = 'vest' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade WHERE LOWER(county) = 'vest';
Result:
- county: vest
- exports (us mil):  6270.2
- imports (us mil):  6597.6
- percent of total exports: 15.0 %
- percent of total imports: 9.9 %

3) Any row(s) where the numeric percent of total exports equals 13.8
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade WHERE regexp_replace("percent of total exports", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g')::numeric = 13.8;
Result:
- county: sud - est | exports (us mil):  5762 | imports (us mil):  7501.9 | percent of total exports: 13.8 % | percent of total imports: 11.2 %

Findings
- For county "vest", exports are 6270.2 (US mil) and percent of total exports is 15.0%, not 13.8%.
- The 13.8% share belongs to a different entry: "sud - est" (exports 5762 US mil), not "vest".

Conclusion
- The claim pairs the correct export value for vest (6270.2) with an incorrect percent-of-total-exports value (should be 15.0%, not 13.8%).

Assumptions
- Interpreted "country" as the table’s "county" field and "vest" as the county/region labeled "vest" in the table.
- Interpreted "export be 6270.2" as the value in column "exports (us mil)" and the percentage as the value in "percent of total exports".
