Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact12 (public schema)
- Identified table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns include: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates)

Step 2 — Retrieve the relevant record for Sidney R. Yates
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Yates%';

Result (single row):
- district: illinois 9
- incumbent: sidney r yates
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1964
- result: re - elected
- candidates: sidney r yates (d) unopposed

Assessment of the claim
- The data explicitly provides a “first elected” year of 1964 for incumbent Sidney R. Yates in the 1974 House elections table.
- There is no field or evidence in this dataset referring to a “fourth elect” or “fourth election” year. Thus, the claim that “the fourth elect incumbent Sidney R. Yates be in 1964” is not supported by the available data.
- However, if the intended claim was that his “first elected” year is 1964, that statement is supported by the data in this table.

Conclusion
- The dataset supports: first elected = 1964.
- The dataset does not support: fourth elected = 1964.

Assumptions (due to ambiguous phrasing)
- I interpreted “fourth elect” literally as “fourth election” or “fourth time elected,” which is not represented in the dataset. If “fourth” was a typographical error for “first,” then the claim aligns with the data.
