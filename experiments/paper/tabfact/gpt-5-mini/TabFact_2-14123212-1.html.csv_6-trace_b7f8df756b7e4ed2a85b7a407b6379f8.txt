Summary conclusion: In the available data, all listed translator-like stations are class “d” only; there is no evidence of any being class “c”. Therefore, the claim that “the translator be class d and c” is not supported by the data (the “d” part is supported; the “c” part is contradicted).

Data source discovery
- Tool: functions.discover_data_sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database available: TabFact (schema: public)

Schema inspection
- Tool: functions.schema_query
- Context hint: TabFact public schema
- Query: List all tables in the public schema with brief descriptions if available.
- Result: Found table public.whlp with columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (double precision), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text).

Evidence queries and results
1) Retrieve all rows to inspect classes
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM whlp;
Results:
[{"call sign":"w221by","city of license":"elgin , illinois","class":"d","erp w":38,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":92.1},
 {"call sign":"w264bf","city of license":"englewood , illinois","class":"d","erp w":2,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":100.7},
 {"call sign":"w240bj","city of license":"crown point , indiana","class":"d","erp w":10,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":95.9},
 {"call sign":"w276bm","city of license":"park forest , illinois","class":"d","erp w":19,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":103.1},
 {"call sign":"w293al","city of license":"rochester , indiana","class":"d","erp w":80,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":106.5},
 {"call sign":"w223au","city of license":"south bend , indiana","class":"d","erp w":10,"fcc info":"fcc","frequency mhz":92.5}]

2) Summarize distinct classes present
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT class FROM whlp;
Result:
[{"class":"d"}]

3) Check for explicit mention of the word “translator” in text fields (sanity check)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM whlp WHERE lower("call sign") LIKE '%translator%' OR lower("city of license") LIKE '%translator%' OR lower(class) LIKE '%translator%' OR lower("fcc info") LIKE '%translator%';
Result: no rows returned

Interpretation of evidence
- Every row in the whlp table has class = "d".
- No rows exhibit class = "c".
- The call signs (e.g., W221BY, W264BF) are typical of FM translators, which aligns with the table appearing to list translator stations, but regardless, the class values are unambiguously “d” in this dataset.

Conclusion
- Supported: translator entries here are class “d”.
- Not supported: translator entries being class “c”.

Assumptions
- “translator” refers to the stations listed in the whlp table (their call sign patterns are consistent with translators).
- The "class" column represents the station class as recorded in this dataset. The conclusion is limited to the provided data.
