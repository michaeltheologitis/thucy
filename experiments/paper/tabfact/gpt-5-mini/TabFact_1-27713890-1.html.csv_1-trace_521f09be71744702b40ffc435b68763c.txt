Claim to verify: “episode 11, the one with all the resolution, air on the 7th of january, 1999.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered one PostgreSQL instance (TabFact, public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.friends_season_5 (episode-level metadata for Friends Season 5).

Evidence gathered:
1) Retrieve Season 5, Episode 11 record
- Result:
  - no in series: 108
  - no in season: 11
  - title: the one with all the resolutions
  - original air date: january 7 , 1999
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "original air date"
  FROM public.friends_season_5
  WHERE "no in season" = 11;

Assessment:
- Air date: Matches exactly (January 7, 1999).
- Title: The data shows the title as “the one with all the resolutions” (plural). The claim uses “resolution” (singular), which is a minor naming inaccuracy; the intended episode clearly corresponds to Season 5, Episode 11 of Friends.

Conclusion: The air date is correct; the episode title is slightly misstated (plural vs. singular).

Assumptions made:
- “episode 11” refers to Friends Season 5, Episode 11, identified by the distinctive title provided in the database.
