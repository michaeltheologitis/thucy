Claim to verify: “Collingwood have a home team score 2.00 point higher than that of Carlton.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1954_vfl_season
  Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

What I checked and found
1) Confirm teams present and number of home games
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", COUNT(*) AS home_games
  FROM t_1954_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" IS NOT NULL AND trim("home team") <> ''
  GROUP BY "home team"
  ORDER BY "home team";
- Result (excerpt):
  - carlton — 1
  - collingwood — 1
  (Each appears once as a home team in this dataset.)

2) Verify the raw stored scores for those games
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date"
  FROM t_1954_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood','carlton')
  ORDER BY "date";
- Result:
  - home team: collingwood | home team score: 12.16 (88) | away team: south melbourne | away team score: 13.12 (90) | date: 14 august 1954
  - home team: carlton | home team score: 10.16 (76) | away team: essendon | away team score: 11.14 (80) | date: 14 august 1954

3) Compute home-team total points (using the numeric total in parentheses) and compare averages
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT
    to_char(AVG( CASE WHEN lower("home team")='collingwood' THEN (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::numeric END), 'FM99999990.00') AS coll_avg,
    to_char(AVG( CASE WHEN lower("home team")='carlton' THEN (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::numeric END), 'FM99999990.00') AS carlton_avg,
    to_char(
      (AVG( CASE WHEN lower("home team")='collingwood' THEN (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::numeric END)
       - AVG( CASE WHEN lower("home team")='carlton' THEN (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::numeric END)
      ),
      'FM99999990.00') AS diff
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
- Result:
  - Collingwood average home-team total points: 88.00
  - Carlton average home-team total points: 76.00
  - Difference (Collingwood minus Carlton): 12.00

Conclusion
- The data show Collingwood’s home team score exceeds Carlton’s by 12.00 points in this dataset, not 2.00 points. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “home team score” as the total points (the number in parentheses) in the VFL/AFL score format (e.g., goals.behinds (total)).
- Interpreted the claim as comparing the teams’ home-team total points as present in the available 1954 VFL season table. Since each team appears once at home in this table, the “average” equals that single game’s total.
- Team names are stored in lowercase in this dataset; matching used lowercase comparisons accordingly.
