Summary of the claim
Claim: “there be 12 t - 260 eu aircraft currently in service that originate from switzerland.”

What the data shows
- The TabFact database (public schema) contains one relevant table: uruguayan_air_force, with columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, in service.
- There is a row for “aermacchi sf260” with versions “t - 260 eu,” origin “italy,” and “in service” equal to 12.
- No rows show “t - 260 eu” with origin “switzerland.”

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any entries mentioning “260”
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, origin, type, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%260%' OR type ILIKE '%260%';
Result:
- aircraft: aermacchi sf260
  origin: italy
  type: trainer
  versions: t - 260 eu
  in service: 12

2) Directly query entries for versions containing “t - 260 eu”
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, origin, versions, "in service" FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE versions = 't - 260 eu' OR versions ILIKE '%t - 260 eu%';
Result:
- aircraft: aermacchi sf260
  origin: italy
  versions: t - 260 eu
  in service: 12

3) Check whether any such entries originate from Switzerland
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_switzerland_t260eu FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE lower(origin) = 'switzerland' AND versions ILIKE '%t - 260 eu%';
Result: 0

For context, count entries with origin = Italy
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_italy FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE lower(origin) = 'italy';
Result: 1

Assessment of the claim
- “12 … t - 260 eu … currently in service”: Supported by the in service value of 12 for the Aermacchi SF-260 with versions “t - 260 eu.”
- “… originate from switzerland”: Contradicted by the data, which lists the origin as “italy.”

Conclusion: The count is correct (12), but the stated country of origin is not; the data shows Italy, not Switzerland.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “t - 260 eu” as the “versions” field value for the Aermacchi SF-260 entry in the uruguayan_air_force table.
- Interpreted “currently in service” as reflected by the “in service” column in this dataset, which we treat as authoritative within its scope (Uruguayan Air Force inventory).
