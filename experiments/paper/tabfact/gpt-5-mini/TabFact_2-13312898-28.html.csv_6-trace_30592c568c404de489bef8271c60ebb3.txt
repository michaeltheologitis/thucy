Claim to verify: “wes robert and ed whitley be both pick in the 3rd round.”

Summary conclusion: In the Indianapolis Colts draft history data, Wes Roberts and Ed Whitley were not selected in the 3rd round. Wes Roberts was a 7th-round pick and Ed Whitley was an 11th-round pick.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history

Schema confirmation (to understand available fields)
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='indianapolis_colts_draft_history' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Returned columns:
- round (bigint)
- pick (bigint)
- overall (bigint)
- name (text)
- position (text)
- college (text)
Note: No year column exists in this table.

Evidence queries and results
1) Name search for “wes” or “whitley” (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, round, pick, overall FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(name) LIKE '%wes%' OR lower(name) LIKE '%whitley%';
Results:
- wes roberts — round: 7, pick: 5, overall: 170
- ed whitley — round: 11, pick: 3, overall: 280

2) Prefix confirmation to ensure precise matching
Executed SQL (Wes Roberts):
SELECT name, round, pick, overall
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE lower(name) LIKE 'wes rob%'
ORDER BY overall;
Result:
- wes roberts — round: 7, pick: 5, overall: 170

Executed SQL (Ed Whitley):
SELECT name, round, pick, overall
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE lower(name) LIKE 'ed whit%'
ORDER BY overall;
Result:
- ed whitley — round: 11, pick: 3, overall: 280

Conclusion based on data
- Neither Wes Roberts nor Ed Whitley was selected in the 3rd round in the Indianapolis Colts draft history table. The data shows 7th and 11th rounds, respectively. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the players as recorded in the Indianapolis Colts draft history dataset, interpreting “wes robert” as “Wes Roberts.”
- Verification is limited to this authoritative dataset, which does not include a year column but does include round, pick (within round), and overall pick.
