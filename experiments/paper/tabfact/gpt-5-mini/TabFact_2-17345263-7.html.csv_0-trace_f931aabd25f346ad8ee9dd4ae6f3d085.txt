Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8). The only relevant table for games/opponents/stadiums is public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 with columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text).

Claim interpreted
- Interpreted as: For the game listed at the site “Legion Field, Birmingham, AL,” the opponent is Alabama (within the available East Carolina Pirates football 1990–99 dataset).

Evidence from data
- Executed SQL (used to find any games at Legion Field or Birmingham, AL and identify the opponent):
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result
  FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
  WHERE site ILIKE '%Legion Field%'
     OR site ILIKE '%Birmingham, AL%'
     OR site ILIKE '%Birmingham,AL%'
     OR site ILIKE '%Birmingham%AL%';

- Result:
  date: october 17 | opponent: alabama | site: legion field birmingham , al | result: l22 - 23

Assessment
- The dataset contains a game with site recorded as “legion field birmingham , al,” and the opponent is explicitly listed as “alabama.” This supports the claim within the scope of the available data.
