Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and inspected its schema to ground the verification.
- Identified a relevant table (public.merlin_series_2) containing episode-level data, including a "written by" column.
- Queried the table to find any episodes in Series 2 credited to Lucy Watkins and counted them.

Data source discovery
- Available source: postgres_tabfact24 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: merlin_series_2 with columns: "no overall", "no for series", title, "directed by", "written by", "original air date", "uk viewers (million)".

Evidence 1: List episodes credited to Lucy Watkins in Series 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no for series", "no overall", title, "written by"
FROM public.merlin_series_2
WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%lucy watkins%'
ORDER BY "no for series";

Result:
- no for series: 10; no overall: 23; title: sweet dreams; written by: lucy watkins

Evidence 2: Count episodes credited to Lucy Watkins in Series 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Lucy Watkins%';

Result:
- count = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one Series 2 episode ("sweet dreams") credited to Lucy Watkins. This supports the claim that Lucy Watkins only wrote 1 episode of Series 2.

Assumptions
- "Series 2" refers to the Merlin Series 2 dataset present in the database (public.merlin_series_2).
- Matching by writer name is done via case-insensitive substring search in the "written by" field.
