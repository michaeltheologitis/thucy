Claim to verify: “part number lf80537 gf0411 m have a frequency of 2 ghz.”

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) exposing table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors. Relevant columns include model number, sspec number, frequency, and part number (s).

Evidence collected:
- Executed SQL query:
  SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "frequency", "part number (s)" 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
  WHERE "part number (s)" ILIKE '%LF80537 GF0411 M%';

- Query result:
  • model number: pentium dual - core t3200
  • sspec number: slavg (m0)
  • frequency: 2 ghz
  • part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m

Assessment:
- The database contains an entry where the part number exactly matches “lf80537 gf0411 m,” and its frequency is listed as “2 ghz.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Case-insensitive substring match was used to locate the part number in a text field that may contain multiple part numbers.
- “Frequency” field represents the processor’s advertised/base clock frequency, which aligns with the claim.
