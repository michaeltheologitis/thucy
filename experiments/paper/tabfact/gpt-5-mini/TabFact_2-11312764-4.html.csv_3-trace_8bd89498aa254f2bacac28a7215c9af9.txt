Claim to verify: "bodil olsson be not from switzerland and do not receive 27 sp + f"

How I interpreted the claim:
- Entity: Bodil Olsson (a competitor in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships dataset).
- Sub-claim 1: Bodil Olsson is not from Switzerland.
- Sub-claim 2: Bodil Olsson did not receive 27 in the “SP + FS” metric (short program + free skate total).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships with columns: rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate Bodil Olsson and retrieve nation and "sp + fs" value
SQL:
SELECT name, nation, "sp + fs" FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Bodil%';
Result:
- name = bodil olsson, nation = sweden, sp + fs = 23

2) Confirm exact (case-insensitive) match and full row details; also count matches
SQL (row details):
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE lower(name) = 'bodil olsson';
Result:
- rank: 25
- name: bodil olsson
- nation: sweden
- sp + fs: 23
- points: 147.02
- places: 225

SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE lower(name) = 'bodil olsson';
Result:
- match_count: 1

Assessment of sub-claims against evidence:
- Not from Switzerland: Supported. The nation value is "sweden", not Switzerland.
- Did not receive 27 in “SP + FS”: Supported. The "sp + fs" value is 23, which is not 27.

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the TabFact table.

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “sp + f” in the claim refers to the dataset’s “sp + fs” column (short program + free skate total).
- The relevant person is the unique entry "bodil olsson" in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships table in the accessible dataset.
