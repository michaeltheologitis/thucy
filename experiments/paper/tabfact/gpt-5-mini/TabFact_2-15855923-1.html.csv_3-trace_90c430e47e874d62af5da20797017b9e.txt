Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL (TabFact) database with a single accessible table in the public schema: public.kwak_tae_hwi (columns: date, venue, score, result, competition).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Queried for any matches where the score is 3-2 (including dash variants) and the venue mentions Chongqing, China.

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi
WHERE venue ILIKE '%chongqing%' AND venue ILIKE '%china%'
  AND (
    score ILIKE '%3-2%'
    OR score ILIKE '%3–2%'
    OR score ~ '(^|[^0-9])3\s*[-–—‑]\s*2([^0-9]|$)'
  );

Result:
- date: february 17 , 2008
- venue: chongqing , china
- score: 3 - 2
- result: 3 - 2
- competition: 2008 east asian cup

Conclusion:
- The data contains a match with a score of 3-2 that was held in Chongqing, China. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “the game with a score of 3 - 2” as an existence claim (i.e., whether there is a game recorded with that score held in Chongqing, China), since no specific match was referenced.
- Treated 3-2 as including common dash variants and optional spacing.
