Summary conclusion
- The data shows Yugoslavia played two friendly matches in the dataset, and they won both by 2:1, not 0:2. The only 0:2 score recorded is a World Cup qualifier vs Italy, not a friendly. Therefore, the claim is false.

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16), schema: public.
- Relevant table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date TEXT, city TEXT, opponent TEXT, results TEXT, "type of game" TEXT).

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect table contents and game types
SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results LIMIT 50;
Result (7 rows):
- march 22 | sarajevo | uruguay   | 2:1 | friendly
- march 30 | belgrade | romania   | 2:0 | balkan cup
- april 26 | borovo   | poland    | 2:1 | friendly
- august 27 | bucharest , romania | romania | 1:4 | balkan cup
- september 10 | luxembourg | luxembourg | 5:0 | 1982 wcq
- september 27 | ljubljana | denmark | 2:1 | 1982 wcq
- november 15 | torino , italy | italy | 0:2 | 1982 wcq

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results;
Result: 7

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "type of game" FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results;
Result: balkan cup; friendly; 1982 wcq

2) Show friendly matches only
SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE "type of game" = 'friendly';
Results:
- march 22 | sarajevo | uruguay | 2:1
- april 26 | borovo   | poland  | 2:1

3) Check for any friendly with a 0:2 score
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_0_2 FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE results = '0:2' AND "type of game" = 'friendly';
Result: count_0_2 = 0

4) Parse friendly results to confirm both are wins for Yugoslavia
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, results,
       CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1)) AS INTEGER) AS yugoslavia_goals,
       CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2)) AS INTEGER) AS opponent_goals,
       (CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1)) AS INTEGER) > CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2)) AS INTEGER)) AS yugoslavia_won
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE "type of game" = 'friendly' AND results LIKE '%:%'
ORDER BY date;
Results:
- april 26 | poland  | 2:1 | 2 | 1 | true
- march 22 | uruguay | 2:1 | 2 | 1 | true

SQL (totals):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_friendlies,
       SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1)) AS INTEGER) > CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2)) AS INTEGER) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE "type of game" = 'friendly' AND results LIKE '%:%';
Result: total_friendlies = 2; wins = 2

5) Verify where 0:2 occurs
SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results = '0:2';
Result:
- november 15 | torino , italy | italy | 0:2 | 1982 wcq

SQL (ensure no 0:2 friendly exists):
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results = '0:2' AND "type of game" ILIKE '%friendly%';
Result: no rows

Conclusion
- Both friendly matches in the dataset were wins for Yugoslavia, each by 2:1. None of the friendlies ended 0:2. The only 0:2 result is a World Cup qualifier loss to Italy. The claim that Yugoslavia “win both of its friendly match by a score 0:2” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the results format as Yugoslavia goals : opponent goals.
- Interpreted “both of its friendly match” to refer to the two friendlies present in this dataset/table.
