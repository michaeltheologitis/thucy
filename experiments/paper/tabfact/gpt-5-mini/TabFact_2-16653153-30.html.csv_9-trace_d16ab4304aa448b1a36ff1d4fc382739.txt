Conclusion: Verified for the 2008–09 NBL season. Both Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles had the same number of wins (17) and identical overall records (17–13), so their “won” record matches.

What I checked and found
- Available data sources: Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with an NBL standings table for the 2008–09 season.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_nbl_season (contains team, lost, last 5, streak, home, away, % pts, % won).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify columns in the standings table
SQL:
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_09_nbl_season'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Resulting columns:
- team
- lost
- last 5
- streak
- home
- away
- % pts
- % won

2) Retrieve the two teams’ rows
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE team IN ('perth wildcats', 'townsville crocodiles');
Results:
- perth wildcats: lost=13, last 5=4 - 1, streak=won 2, home=11 - 4, away=6 - 9, % pts=102.06, % won=56.67
- townsville crocodiles: lost=13, last 5=4 - 1, streak=lost 1, home=12 - 3, away=5 - 10, % pts=99.26, % won=56.67

3) Compute wins/losses from home and away splits
SQL:
SELECT team,
  home,
  split_part(home,' - ',1)::int AS home_wins,
  split_part(home,' - ',2)::int AS home_losses,
  away,
  split_part(away,' - ',1)::int AS away_wins,
  split_part(away,' - ',2)::int AS away_losses,
  (split_part(home,' - ',1)::int + split_part(away,' - ',1)::int) AS total_wins,
  (split_part(home,' - ',2)::int + split_part(away,' - ',2)::int) AS total_losses
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE team IN ('perth wildcats','townsville crocodiles');
Results:
- Perth Wildcats: total_wins = 17, total_losses = 13
- Townsville Crocodiles: total_wins = 17, total_losses = 13

Assessment versus the claim
- “Same won record for the season”: Interpreted as the same number of wins. Both teams have 17 wins (and identical 17–13 records), so the claim holds for the 2008–09 NBL season in the available data.

Assumptions
- “The season” refers to the 2008–09 NBL season because that is the season present in the accessible dataset.
- “Won record” is interpreted as total wins (and, equivalently, the full win–loss record).
