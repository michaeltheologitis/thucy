Claim interpreted: “8 of the viral diseases possess an envelope.” I verify this using the TabFact database (public.viral_disease table), specifically the envelopment column.

Evidence from data
- Total rows in viral_disease
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.viral_disease;
  Result: 23

- Distinct envelopment values and counts
  SQL:
  SELECT envelopment, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  GROUP BY envelopment
  ORDER BY count DESC NULLS LAST;
  Results:
  • envelopment = 'enveloped' -> 15
  • envelopment = 'non - enveloped' -> 8

- Direct count of enveloped entries
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_enveloped FROM public.viral_disease WHERE envelopment = 'enveloped';
  Result: 15

Assessment
- The data show 15 viral diseases are enveloped, while 8 are non-enveloped. Therefore, the statement that 8 possess an envelope is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the count of entries in public.viral_disease whose envelopment status indicates they are enveloped (value exactly 'enveloped').
