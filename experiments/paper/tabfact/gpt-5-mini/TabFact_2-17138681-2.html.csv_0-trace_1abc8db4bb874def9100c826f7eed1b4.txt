Claim to verify: “there be more than 12.42 million viewer for the entry with rating / share 3.2 / 8.”

Data source discovery and schema:
- Discovered database: TabFact (TabFact21), schema: public, table: my_info_table with columns:
  - rating (double precision)
  - share (bigint)
  - rating / share (18 - 49) (text)
  - viewers (millions) (double precision)
  - rank (overall) (bigint)

Evidence collected:
1) Initial exact match attempts (no rows found)
Executed SQL:
SELECT rating, share, "rating / share (18 - 49)", "viewers (millions)"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE (rating = 3.2 AND share = 8)
   OR ("rating / share (18 - 49)" = '3.2/8');
Result: no rows returned.

Executed SQL:
SELECT rating, share, "rating / share (18 - 49)", "viewers (millions)"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE (ABS(rating - 3.2) < 1e-6 AND share = 8)
   OR (regexp_replace("rating / share (18 - 49)", '\s+', '', 'g') = '3.2/8');
Result: no rows returned.

2) Identify available rating/share values
Executed SQL:
SELECT "rating / share (18 - 49)" AS rating_share, AVG("viewers (millions)") AS avg_viewers, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "rating / share (18 - 49)" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "rating / share (18 - 49)"
ORDER BY rating_share;
Result excerpt includes: 3.2 / 8 — avg_viewers = 12.42 (millions), count = 1.

3) Retrieve the specific entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT rating, share, "rating / share (18 - 49)", "viewers (millions)", "rank (overall)"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "rating / share (18 - 49)" = '3.2 / 8';
Result:
- rating: 7.2
- share: 11
- rating / share (18 - 49): 3.2 / 8
- viewers (millions): 12.42
- rank (overall): 15

4) Check “more than 12.42” explicitly
Executed SQL:
SELECT "viewers (millions)", ("viewers (millions)" > 12.42) AS exceeds_12_42
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "rating / share (18 - 49)" = '3.2 / 8';
Result:
viewers (millions) = 12.42; exceeds_12_42 = false.

Conclusion:
- The only entry with rating/share “3.2 / 8” (18–49) has exactly 12.42 million viewers. Therefore, it is not “more than 12.42 million.”

Assumptions:
- “rating / share 3.2 / 8” refers to the text column “rating / share (18 - 49)” with the exact formatting “3.2 / 8”.
- “more than 12.42” is interpreted as a strict greater-than comparison (> 12.42).
