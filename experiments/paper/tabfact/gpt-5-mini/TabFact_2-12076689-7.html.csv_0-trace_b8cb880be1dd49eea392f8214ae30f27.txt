Summary
- Claim: In the 2006 season, the Texas Rangers played the Mariners 9 times.
- Finding: The dataset for the 2006 Texas Rangers season shows 9 games against the Mariners.

Evidence from data
1) Distinct opponents and counts
SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM t_2006_texas_rangers_season
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY games DESC;
Results (excerpt):
- mariners — 9 games
- angels — 7 games
- indians — 6 games
- athletics — 3 games
- tigers — 2 games

2) List of all games vs. Mariners (to confirm the count)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'mariners'
ORDER BY date;
Returned 9 rows (dates spanning September–October), e.g.:
- september 8 — mariners — 7 - 2 — attendance: 28646
- ...
- october 1 — mariners — 3 - 2 — attendance: 28361

For chronological ordering (since the date column is text):
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'mariners'
ORDER BY to_date(date, 'FMMonth FMDD');
Returned the same 9 rows in chronological order.

3) Total rows and Mariners-specific count (sanity check)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season;
Result: 27

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS mariners_games FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE lower(opponent) = 'mariners';
Result: 9

Conclusion
- Based on the t_2006_texas_rangers_season table, the Rangers played the Mariners 9 times in the recorded 2006 season data.

Assumptions
- “mariner” refers to the Seattle Mariners.
- Matching used a case-insensitive comparison on opponent = 'mariners'.
