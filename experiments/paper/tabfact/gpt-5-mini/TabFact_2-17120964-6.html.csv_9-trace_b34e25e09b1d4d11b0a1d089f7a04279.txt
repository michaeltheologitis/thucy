Claim being checked: “the man of the match against the slough jet on the 2nd be lukas smital.”

Conclusion: Not supported by the data. For the game against Slough Jets on the 2nd, the Man of the Match was Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital. Smital was Man of the Match on the 1st against Slough Jets.

Evidence from the data source (TabFact database; table: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season)

1) Retrieve all entries vs Slough Jets
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, competition, "man of the match"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Slough%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Jets%';
- Results (date | opponent | competition | man of the match):
  - 1st | slough jets | league / cup | lukas smital
  - 2nd | slough jets | league      | paul dixon

2) Verify the specific game on the 2nd vs Slough Jets
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, competition, "man of the match" 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Slough Jets%'
    AND date ILIKE '%2nd%';
- Result row:
  - date: 2nd | opponent: slough jets | competition: league | man of the match: paul dixon

Assessment of claim components
- Opponent: “Slough Jet” interpreted as Slough Jets — matches the data (true in intent).
- Date: “on the 2nd” matches an entry labeled “2nd” (true).
- Man of the Match: asserted “Lukas Smital,” but data shows “Paul Dixon” (false).

Final determination: The central assertion (that Smital was MoM on the 2nd vs Slough Jets) is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “slough jet” refers to the team Slough Jets.
- “on the 2nd” refers to the text-form date value “2nd” in the table (the dataset stores day-of-month as textual ordinals without month/year).
- The TabFact table t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season is the authoritative source available for this verification.
