Claim interpreted: “Jelle Van Damme scored 3 times as much as each of the other 2 players in the UEFA Champions League tournament.”

Step 1 — Explore available data sources
- Discovered a single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season. Columns: player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total.

Check whether any Champions League-specific data exists
- Executed SQL (search column names for ‘champ’):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE column_name ILIKE '%champ%';
  Result: match_count = 0

- Executed SQL (search table names for ‘champ’):
  SELECT schemaname, tablename
  FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
  WHERE tablename ILIKE '%champ%'
  ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;
  Result: no matching rows

Conclusion from Step 1: The accessible dataset contains no tables/columns explicitly covering the UEFA Champions League. Therefore, the “Champions League” part of the claim cannot be directly verified from the available data.

Step 2 — Examine the available Anderlecht 2008–09 season table
- Executed SQL to view all rows:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;
  Returned rows (player, league, title playoff, super cup, total) include:
  - jelle van damme: league 3, title playoff 0, super cup 0, total 3
  - víctor bernárdez: total 1; bart goor: total 1; nemanja rnić: total 1
  (Plus additional players with higher totals.)

- Executed SQL to retrieve Jelle Van Damme’s total goals:
  SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player ILIKE 'Jelle Van Damme';
  Result: Jelle Van Damme — total = 3

- Executed SQL to list players with total = 1:
  SELECT player, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 1 ORDER BY player;
  Results: bart goor — 1; nemanja rnić — 1; víctor bernárdez — 1

Analysis against the claim
- Numerical relation: In the available dataset, Jelle Van Damme scored 3 total goals. There are at least two players (e.g., Bart Goor, Nemanja Rnić, Víctor Bernárdez) who each scored 1 total goal. Thus, with respect to this dataset, Jelle Van Damme scored 3 times as many goals as each of at least two other players.
- Competition context: The dataset covers Anderlecht’s season totals (league, title playoff, super cup) and not the UEFA Champions League. Therefore, the part of the claim that specifies “UEFA Champions League tournament” is not supported by the accessible data.

Conclusion
- The 3x numerical comparison is supported by the available Anderlecht season data.
- The specific “UEFA Champions League tournament” context is unsupported by the accessible data and cannot be verified here.

Assumptions made for verification
- Due to the absence of Champions League data in the accessible database, I evaluated the claim’s numerical relationship using the available Anderlecht 2008–09 season totals table. I interpret “other 2 player” to mean “there exist at least two players” each with 1 goal for comparison, not that there are exactly two players at 1 goal.
