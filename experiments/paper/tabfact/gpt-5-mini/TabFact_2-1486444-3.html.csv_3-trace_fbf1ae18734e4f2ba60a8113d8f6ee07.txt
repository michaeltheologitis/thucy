Claim to verify: “shooto 2003: 3 / 18 be the event in turku, finland and have an opponent of rumina sato.”

Summary conclusion:
- The event “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” exists in the data and lists Rumina Sato as the opponent.
- However, the recorded location for that event is Tokyo, Japan—not Turku, Finland.

Data sources consulted:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Table: public.joachim_hansen_fighter (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Find Shooto events in 2003
SQL:
SELECT event, opponent, location FROM joachim_hansen_fighter WHERE event ILIKE '%Shooto%' AND event ILIKE '%2003%';
Results:
- event: "shooto 2003: year end show" | opponent: "vitor ribeiro" | location: "chiba , chiba , japan"
- event: "shooto 2003: 8 / 10" | opponent: "takanori gomi" | location: "yokohama , japan"
- event: "shooto 2003: 3 / 18" | opponent: "rumina sato" | location: "tokyo , japan"

2) Specifically locate the “3 / 18” event
SQL:
SELECT event, opponent, location FROM joachim_hansen_fighter WHERE event ILIKE '%3 / 18%';
Results:
- event: "shooto 2003: 3 / 18" | opponent: "rumina sato" | location: "tokyo , japan"

3) Check for any Shooto 2003 events in Turku
SQL:
SELECT event, opponent, location FROM joachim_hansen_fighter WHERE event ILIKE '%Shooto%' AND event ILIKE '%2003%' AND location ILIKE '%Turku%';
Results:
- no rows returned

Assessment of the claim's components:
- Event identity: True — “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” is present.
- Opponent: True — opponent listed is Rumina Sato.
- Location: False — data records the location as Tokyo, Japan; no Shooto 2003 events are recorded in Turku, Finland in this table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” as the event label stored in the “event” column.
- Used case-insensitive searches (ILIKE) and matched the date pattern exactly as "3 / 18" because that is how it appears in the data.
- Treated this table as the authoritative source available for verification, as it is the only accessible dataset provided.
