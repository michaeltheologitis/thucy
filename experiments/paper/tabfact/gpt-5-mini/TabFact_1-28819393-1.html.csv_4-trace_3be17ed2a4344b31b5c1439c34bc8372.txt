Claim to verify: "in 1987, the average vote per candidate be less than 1.35%"

Data source consulted: TabFact (PostgreSQL), table public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results (Green Party of England & Wales election results).

What metric matches the claim: The column "average % of vote per candidate" represents the average percentage of votes obtained per candidate, which aligns with the claim’s wording about average vote per candidate in percent.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve 1987 values
SQL:
SELECT year, candidates, "average % of vote per candidate" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE year = '1987';
Result:
- year: "1987"
- candidates: 133
- average % of vote per candidate: 1.35

2) Directly test the claim (is it less than 1.35?)
SQL:
SELECT year, candidates, "average % of vote per candidate", ("average % of vote per candidate" < 1.35) AS less_than_1_35 FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE year = '1987';
Result:
- year: "1987"
- candidates: 133
- average % of vote per candidate: 1.35
- less_than_1_35: false

Conclusion: In 1987, the average % of vote per candidate is exactly 1.35%. Therefore, it is not less than 1.35%. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the "average % of vote per candidate" metric in the Green Party of England & Wales election results table for the year 1987.
- The value 1.35 in the database is authoritative and not a rounded display of a smaller underlying value; no more granular precision was available in the data returned.
