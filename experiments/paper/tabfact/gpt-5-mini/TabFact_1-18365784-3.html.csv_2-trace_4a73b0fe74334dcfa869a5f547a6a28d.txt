Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema).

Schema inspection
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: departure (text), "going to" (text), "calling at" (text), arrival (double precision), operator (text).

Verification step
- Question interpreted: Determine the destination ("going to") of the train whose "calling at" list includes Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria.

Executed SQL (evidence)
SELECT DISTINCT "going to" FROM my_info_table WHERE "calling at" ILIKE '%Boston%' AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Sleaford%' AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Nottingham Victoria%';

Result
- going to: nottingham victoria

Conclusion
- The data shows that a train calling at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria has destination “nottingham victoria,” which supports the claim that the destination is Nottingham Victoria.

Assumptions
- The "calling at" field is free-text; presence of station names was checked via case-insensitive substring matches (ILIKE '%...%').
