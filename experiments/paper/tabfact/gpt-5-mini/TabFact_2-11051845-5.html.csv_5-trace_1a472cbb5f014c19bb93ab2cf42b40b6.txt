Claim to verify: “irregular galaxy [is] the object type [to] have 2.1 more apparent magnitude than globular galaxy.”

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17)
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
- Relevant columns: object type (text), apparent magnitude (double precision)

Step 1 — What object types exist in this dataset?
Evidence (SQL):
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY count DESC, "object type";
Result:
- irregular galaxy: 2
- spiral galaxy: 2
- globular cluster: 1
Note: The dataset contains “globular cluster” but not “globular galaxy”.

Step 2 — Retrieve individual apparent magnitudes for the two relevant types
Evidence (SQL):
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude" 
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IN ('irregular galaxy','globular cluster')
ORDER BY "object type", "ngc number";
Result rows:
- NGC 5466 — globular cluster — apparent magnitude: 10.5
- NGC 5408 — irregular galaxy — apparent magnitude: 14.0
- NGC 5477 — irregular galaxy — apparent magnitude: 14.5

Step 3 — Compute the average apparent magnitudes by type
Evidence (SQL):
SELECT "object type", AVG("apparent magnitude") AS average_magnitude, COUNT(*) AS count_objects
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IN ('irregular galaxy','globular cluster')
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY "object type";
Results:
- globular cluster — average_magnitude: 10.5 (count: 1)
- irregular galaxy — average_magnitude: 14.25 (count: 2)

Step 4 — Compute the difference (irregular − globular)
Evidence (SQLs and results):
1) SELECT avg("apparent magnitude") AS avg_irregular FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 WHERE "object type" = 'irregular galaxy';
   Result: 14.25
2) SELECT avg("apparent magnitude") AS avg_globular FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 WHERE "object type" = 'globular cluster';
   Result: 10.5
Difference: 14.25 − 10.5 = 3.75 magnitudes

Conclusion
- In this dataset (NGC objects 5001–6000), irregular galaxies have an average apparent magnitude 3.75 magnitudes higher (i.e., numerically larger/fainter) than globular clusters, not 2.1. The claim is contradicted by the data available here.

Assumptions and scope
- The claim’s “globular galaxy” was interpreted as “globular cluster,” since “globular galaxy” does not appear in the dataset’s object type field, while “globular cluster” does.
- All calculations are based solely on the table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (a limited subset of NGC objects). Within this authoritative dataset, the stated 2.1 magnitude difference is not supported.
