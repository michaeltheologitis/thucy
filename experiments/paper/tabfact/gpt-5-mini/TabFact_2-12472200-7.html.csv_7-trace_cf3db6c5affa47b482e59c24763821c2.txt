Claim to verify: “Olga Govortsova have win at least 5 Grand Slam tournament match in any give year from 2007 - 2011.”

Summary conclusion based on data: In none of the years 2007–2011 did Olga Govortsova win 5 or more Grand Slam main-draw matches. Totals per year are: 2007=2, 2008=3, 2009=3, 2010=1, 2011=1.

Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema) containing table public.olga_govortsova with columns: tournament (text), 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect Grand Slam rows (raw stored results)
Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament, "2007","2008","2009","2010","2011"
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(tournament) IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open')
ORDER BY tournament;

Returned rows:
- australian open: 2007 = "a", 2008 = "1r", 2009 = "1r", 2010 = "1r", 2011 = "1r"
- french open:     2007 = "a", 2008 = "3r", 2009 = "3r", 2010 = "2r", 2011 = "2r"
- us open:         2007 = "2r", 2008 = "2r", 2009 = "1r", 2010 = "1r", 2011 = "1r"
- wimbledon:       2007 = "2r", 2008 = "1r", 2009 = "2r", 2010 = "1r", 2011 = "1r"

2) Convert round results to wins and sum per year
Mapping used: 1R→0, 2R→1, 3R→2, 4R→3, QF→4, SF→5, F→6, W→7; anything else (e.g., 'a', 'lq', 'nh', NULL)→0.

Executed SQL (aggregation across the four Grand Slams):
SELECT
sum(CASE lower(coalesce("2007",''))
         WHEN '1r' THEN 0 WHEN '2r' THEN 1 WHEN '3r' THEN 2 WHEN '4r' THEN 3
         WHEN 'qf' THEN 4 WHEN 'sf' THEN 5 WHEN 'f' THEN 6 WHEN 'w' THEN 7 ELSE 0 END) as wins_2007,
sum(CASE lower(coalesce("2008",''))
         WHEN '1r' THEN 0 WHEN '2r' THEN 1 WHEN '3r' THEN 2 WHEN '4r' THEN 3
         WHEN 'qf' THEN 4 WHEN 'sf' THEN 5 WHEN 'f' THEN 6 WHEN 'w' THEN 7 ELSE 0 END) as wins_2008,
sum(CASE lower(coalesce("2009",''))
         WHEN '1r' THEN 0 WHEN '2r' THEN 1 WHEN '3r' THEN 2 WHEN '4r' THEN 3
         WHEN 'qf' THEN 4 WHEN 'sf' THEN 5 WHEN 'f' THEN 6 WHEN 'w' THEN 7 ELSE 0 END) as wins_2009,
sum(CASE lower(coalesce("2010",''))
         WHEN '1r' THEN 0 WHEN '2r' THEN 1 WHEN '3r' THEN 2 WHEN '4r' THEN 3
         WHEN 'qf' THEN 4 WHEN 'sf' THEN 5 WHEN 'f' THEN 6 WHEN 'w' THEN 7 ELSE 0 END) as wins_2010,
sum(CASE lower(coalesce("2011",''))
         WHEN '1r' THEN 0 WHEN '2r' THEN 1 WHEN '3r' THEN 2 WHEN '4r' THEN 3
         WHEN 'qf' THEN 4 WHEN 'sf' THEN 5 WHEN 'f' THEN 6 WHEN 'w' THEN 7 ELSE 0 END) as wins_2011
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE lower(tournament) IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open');

Returned totals:
- wins_2007 = 2
- wins_2008 = 3
- wins_2009 = 3
- wins_2010 = 1
- wins_2011 = 1

Conclusion: No year from 2007 through 2011 meets or exceeds 5 Grand Slam match wins. The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The table encodes the last round reached in each Grand Slam singles main draw per year.
- Round-to-wins mapping: 1R=0, 2R=1, 3R=2, 4R=3, QF=4, SF=5, F=6, W=7; non-participation or non-main-draw entries (e.g., 'a', 'lq', 'nh') count as 0 wins.
- Only the four Slams (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) were included in the totals.
