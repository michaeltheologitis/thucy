Claim interpreted: “Nesheim Bridge is in McVille.”

What I did
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema. The TabFact PostgreSQL database exposes the public schema with a table likely containing place/POI data: public.my_info_table (columns: name, listed, location, county, type).
- Queried this table for any entries mentioning “Nesheim” or “McVille.”

Evidence
- Matching record found that directly ties Nesheim Bridge to McVille:
  - name: nesheim bridge
  - listed: 1997 - 02 - 27
  - location: mcville
  - county: nelson
  - type: pratt through truss

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT name, listed, location, county, type
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE name ILIKE '%nesheim%'
   OR listed ILIKE '%nesheim%'
   OR location ILIKE '%nesheim%'
   OR county ILIKE '%nesheim%'
   OR type ILIKE '%nesheim%'
   OR name ILIKE '%mcville%'
   OR listed ILIKE '%mcville%'
   OR location ILIKE '%mcville%'
   OR county ILIKE '%mcville%'
   OR type ILIKE '%mcville%';

Conclusion
- The record shows the location value "mcville" for “nesheim bridge,” supporting the claim that Nesheim Bridge is in McVille.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the user’s statement as a verification question about location: “Is Nesheim Bridge in McVille?”
- “In McVille” is taken to mean the bridge’s location field equals “mcville” in the authoritative dataset.
- A case-insensitive search was used to locate relevant entries.
