Claim to verify: “in the period 1995 - 2000, the imr be 34.0 and the life expectancy be 69.3.”

Evidence from data:
- Data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL) → public.my_info_table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, imr, "life expectancy total" FROM my_info_table WHERE period = '1995 - 2000';
- Result:
  period: 1995 - 2000
  imr: 34
  life expectancy total: 69.3

Assessment:
- The table reports imr = 34 and life expectancy total = 69.3 for the period “1995 - 2000.” The claim’s IMR of 34.0 is equivalent to 34 (difference is formatting/decimal precision). The life expectancy figure matches exactly.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- “imr” refers to the imr column in public.my_info_table.
- “life expectancy” refers to the “life expectancy total” column.
- The “period” is matched exactly to the string “1995 - 2000.”
- Units are as typically used: IMR per 1,000 live births; life expectancy in years (as implied by the dataset).
