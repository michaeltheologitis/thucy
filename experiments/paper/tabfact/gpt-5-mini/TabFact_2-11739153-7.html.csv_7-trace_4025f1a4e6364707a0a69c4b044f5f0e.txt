Conclusion: The scores on February 12 and February 20 during the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season are not the same.

Data source explored
- Table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season (columns include: date [text], visitor [text], score [text], home [text], decision [text], attendance [bigint], record [text]). Dates are stored as lowercase text like “february 12” and scores are stored as text strings like “2 - 4”.

Evidence
1) Targeted retrieval of the two dates in question
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%february 12%'
   OR lower(date) LIKE '%february 20%';

Results:
- february 12: visitor = minnesota, score = 2 - 4, home = edmonton
- february 20: visitor = minnesota, score = 0 - 3, home = chicago

2) (Context) Sample of table contents to confirm date/score formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 20;

Excerpt of results shows entries such as:
- february 12 | minnesota @ edmonton | score: 2 - 4
- february 20 | minnesota @ chicago  | score: 0 - 3

Assessment
- February 12 score: 2 - 4
- February 20 score: 0 - 3
These are not the same. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Same score” is interpreted as the exact same final score string in the score column.
- The table represents the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season and stores February dates without year, with each row corresponding to one game.
