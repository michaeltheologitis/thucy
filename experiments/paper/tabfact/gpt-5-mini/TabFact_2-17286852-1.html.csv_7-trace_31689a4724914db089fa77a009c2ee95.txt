Claim: “the grace city bridge be a concrete deck girder bridge in stanley.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact9), public schema, containing a single table: public.my_info_table with columns: name, listed, location, county, type.

Evidence
1) Identify the record for Grace City Bridge
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Grace City Bridge%';
Result:
- name: grace city bridge
- listed: 1997 - 02 - 27
- location: grace city
- county: foster
- type: pratt through truss

2) Check for bridges associated with “Stanley”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, location, county, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%stanley%' OR location ILIKE '%stanley%' OR county ILIKE '%stanley%';
Result:
- name: great northern railway underpass
  location: stanley
  county: mountrail
  type: concrete deck girder bridge

3) Cross-check entries for Grace City
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, location, county, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE 'grace city' OR name ILIKE '%grace city%';
Result:
- name: grace city bridge
  location: grace city
  county: foster
  type: pratt through truss

Analysis
- The Grace City Bridge is listed as a “pratt through truss,” not a “concrete deck girder bridge.”
- Its county is “foster,” and location is “grace city,” not “Stanley.”
- The dataset does include a “concrete deck girder bridge” in Stanley, but it is the “great northern railway underpass” in Stanley (Mountrail County), not the Grace City Bridge.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: Grace City Bridge is not a concrete deck girder bridge and is not in Stanley.

Assumptions
- Treated public.my_info_table as the authoritative source for these bridge records.
- Interpreted “Stanley” as either a location or county name and searched both fields (plus name) for substring matches.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the record named “grace city bridge” in this dataset.
