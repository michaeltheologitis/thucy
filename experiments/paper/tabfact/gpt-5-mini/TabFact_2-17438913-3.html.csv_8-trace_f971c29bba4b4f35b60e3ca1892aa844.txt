Scope and data sources
- Explored available data sources and found one PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact14, TabFact) with a public schema containing a single relevant table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season. Columns: nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee.
- This table appears to list Rangers F.C. player movements for the 2008–09 season, including transfer fees.

Key evidence from the data
1) Full table scan (to see all entries and locate Chris Burke and any “free” fees)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "nat", "name", "moving to", "type", "transfer window", "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
Observed relevant rows (excerpt):
- jean - claude darcheville — valenciennes — transfer — winter — free
- chris burke — cardiff city — transfer — winter — free

2) Count of players with transfer fee exactly “free” (case-insensitive, trimmed)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS free_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE trim(lower("transfer fee")) = 'free';
Result:
- free_count = 2

3) List of players with transfer fee “free”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE trim(lower("transfer fee")) = 'free' ORDER BY name;
Result rows:
- chris burke
- jean - claude darcheville

4) Distinct transfer fee values and their frequencies (to confirm how many entries could be considered “free”)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "transfer fee", COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
GROUP BY "transfer fee"
ORDER BY count_rows DESC, "transfer fee";
Results:
- "n / a": 28 rows
- "free": 2 rows
- "1 m": 1 row
- "3.5 m": 1 row
- "7.8 m": 1 row

Findings
- Chris Burke appears in the dataset with a transfer fee recorded as “free.” This part of the claim is supported.
- The total number of players in this dataset with a transfer fee of “free” is 2 (Chris Burke and Jean-Claude Darcheville), not 5. Therefore, the numeric part of the claim is contradicted by the data available.

Conclusion
- The statement “Chris Burke [is] one of 5 players to have a free transfer fee” is not supported by the data in the available 2008–09 Rangers F.C. season transfer table. He is one of 2 players recorded with a “free” transfer fee in this dataset.

Assumptions noted
- Scope is limited to the available table (Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season). No broader, cross-season or cross-club data was accessible via the provided tools.
- “Free transfer fee” is interpreted strictly as rows where the transfer fee text equals “free.” Entries marked “n / a” were not treated as “free.”
