Scope and data sources examined:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17)
- Schema: public
- Table: the_baron (episode metadata for the TV series “The Baron”)

Evidence 1: Episodes written by Tony O’Grady
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by"
  FROM public.the_baron
  WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Tony O''Grady%'
  ORDER BY episode;
- Results:
  - Episode 12 — title: "the maze" — written by: "tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens)" — directed by: "jeremy summers"
  - Episode 26 — title: "the long , long day" — written by: "tony o'grady" — directed by: "roy baker"

Evidence 2: Episodes directed by John (Llewellyn) Moxey
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, title, "written by" FROM public.the_baron WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%moxey%' ORDER BY episode;
- Results:
  - Episode 2 — "epitaph for a hero" — written by: terry nation
  - Episode 4 — "red horse , red rider" — written by: terry nation
  - Episode 10 — "the legions of ammak" — written by: michael cramoy
  - Episode 11 — "samurai west" — written by: brian degas
  - Episode 13 — "portrait of louisa" — written by: terry nation

Findings:
- Within the available dataset for The Baron, the episodes credited to Tony O’Grady (which the data explicitly notes as a pseudonym of Brian Clemens) were directed by Jeremy Summers (Ep. 12) and Roy Baker (Ep. 26), not by John (Llewellyn) Moxey.
- John Moxey did direct several episodes of The Baron, but none of the ones written by Tony O’Grady in this dataset.

Conclusion:
- The parenthetical claim that Tony O’Grady is a pseudonym of Brian Clemens is supported by the data.
- The main claim that John Moxey directed the episode written by Tony O’Grady is not supported for The Baron; the evidence shows different directors for those episodes.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to an episode of the TV series “The Baron,” as that is the only accessible data source available. If the claim intended a different series, it cannot be verified with the current data access.
