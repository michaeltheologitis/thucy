Claim to verify: “Ty Lawson led or was tied for the team lead in assists in 10 out of 13 games.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
- Relevant column: "high assists" (text listing the player(s) with most assists for each game)

What the data contains
- The table has 13 rows, with game numbers ranging from 3 to 16 (game 6 is missing). Thus, the dataset covers a 13-game stretch by rows, though one game number in that numeric range isn’t present.

Key checks and evidence
1) Confirm the table’s coverage (row count and game number range)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season;
Result:
- min_game: 3
- max_game: 16
- row_count: 13

2) Count how many of these 13 games list Ty Lawson as a leader (lead or tie) in assists
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS ty_lawson_count FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Ty Lawson%';
Result:
- ty_lawson_count: 2

3) List the specific games where Ty Lawson is listed as a high assists leader
SQL:
SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Ty Lawson%';
Results:
- game: 9, date: november 11, high assists: "chauncey billups , ty lawson (5)"
- game: 15, date: november 25, high assists: "nenê , ty lawson (6)"

4) Maximum Ty Lawson appearances as assists leader in any consecutive 13-game window present in the table (by rows)
SQL:
WITH numbered AS (
  SELECT game, "high assists",
    (CASE WHEN "high assists" ILIKE '%lawson%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS lawson_flag,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY game) AS rn,
    COUNT(*) OVER () AS total_rows,
    LEAD(game,12) OVER (ORDER BY game) AS window_end_game
  FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
),
windowed AS (
  SELECT game AS window_start_game, window_end_game,
    SUM(lawson_flag) OVER (ORDER BY game ROWS BETWEEN CURRENT ROW AND 12 FOLLOWING) AS lawson_count,
    rn, total_rows
  FROM numbered
),
maxv AS (
  SELECT MAX(lawson_count) AS max_lawson_in_13 FROM windowed WHERE rn <= total_rows - 12
)
SELECT m.max_lawson_in_13, w.window_start_game, w.window_end_game
FROM windowed w CROSS JOIN maxv m
WHERE w.rn <= w.total_rows - 12 AND w.lawson_count = m.max_lawson_in_13
ORDER BY w.window_start_game;
Result:
- max_lawson_in_13: 2; window_start_game: 3; window_end_game: 16
Interpretation: In the only full 13-row window available (the whole table), Ty Lawson is listed as a high-assists leader in 2 games, not 10.

Conclusion
- Based on the available 13-game dataset (games numbered 3–16 with one number missing), Ty Lawson led or tied for the team lead in assists in 2 out of 13 games. This directly contradicts the claim of 10 out of 13.

Assumptions and notes
- “Led or tied for the lead in assists” was operationalized as the player’s name appearing in the "high assists" text field; matching was case-insensitive and substring-based (ILIKE '%lawson%' or '%Ty Lawson%').
- The dataset contains exactly 13 games by rows; because one game number (6) is absent in the 3–16 range, we evaluated the single available 13-row window. Regardless, the count of Lawson-led/tied games is 2, far below 10.
- All conclusions are grounded strictly in the data available in the referenced table.
