Claim interpreted: “Two of the teams have the same number of goals scored against them.” We verify this by checking for duplicate values in the 'against' column (goals conceded) of the available football standings table.

Step 1 — Inspect the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT position, team, points, played, "against", difference
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
ORDER BY position;

Result snapshot (position | team | against):
1 | flamengo | 12
2 | fluminense | 15
3 | corinthians | 15
4 | palestra itália | 19
5 | portuguesa | 23
6 | botafogo | 25
7 | vasco da gama | 19
8 | américa | 25
9 | são paulo | 24

Step 2 — Find duplicate 'against' values and the teams sharing them
Executed SQL:
SELECT "against", COUNT(*) AS team_count, array_agg(team ORDER BY team) AS teams
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY "against"
HAVING COUNT(*) >= 2
ORDER BY team_count DESC, "against" ASC;

Result:
- against=15 | team_count=2 | teams={corinthians, fluminense}
- against=19 | team_count=2 | teams={palestra itália, vasco da gama}
- against=25 | team_count=2 | teams={américa, botafogo}

Conclusion:
Yes. There are multiple instances where exactly two teams share the same number of goals against: 15 (corinthians, fluminense), 19 (palestra itália, vasco da gama), and 25 (américa, botafogo). Therefore the claim that two of the teams have the same goals-against number is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “goal score against them” is interpreted as the 'against' column (goals conceded) in public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- The claim requires existence of at least one such pair, not that exactly one pair exists.
