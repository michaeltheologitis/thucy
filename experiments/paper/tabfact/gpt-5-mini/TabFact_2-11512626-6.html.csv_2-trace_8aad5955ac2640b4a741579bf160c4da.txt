Claim to verify: “the attendance on August 26 and August 27 be 48063 and 48032.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1997_colorado_rockies_season — game logs for the 1997 Colorado Rockies season, including an attendance column.

Schema inspection (summary):
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Establish date format present in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season ORDER BY date;
- Observation: Dates are stored as lowercase strings like “august 1”, “august 26”, etc.

2) Retrieve August entries and their attendance values
- SQL:
  SELECT date, attendance FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date LIKE 'august %' ORDER BY (split_part(date, ' ', 2))::int;
- Result excerpts (date — attendance):
  - august 26 — 48063
  - august 27 — 48032
  - Context around those dates also shows nearby days (e.g., august 25 — 48143 and 48081; august 28 — 48422), confirming consistency.

Assessment:
- The table records august 26 with attendance 48063 and august 27 with attendance 48032.
- These values match the claim exactly.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the dates within the 1997 Colorado Rockies season dataset (the only available relevant dataset). The date strings do not include a year, but the table is for the 1997 season.
