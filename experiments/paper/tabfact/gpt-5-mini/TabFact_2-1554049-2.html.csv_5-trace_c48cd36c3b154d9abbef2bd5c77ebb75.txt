Claim to verify: “the surface after October 10, 2004 be hard.”

Data sources discovered:
- postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact) → public.ji_nov_k

Schema inspected:
- Table public.ji_nov_k columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to understand date format
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score
FROM public.ji_nov_k
LIMIT 20;
Result highlights:
- ...
- “october 10 , 2004” | surface: “hard” | opponent: “taylor dent”
- “november 3 , 2004” | surface: “carpet (i)” | opponent: “david nalbandian”
Observation: date is text like “october 10 , 2004” (note spaces around the comma).

Step 2: Find all matches strictly after 2004-10-10 and list surfaces
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, surface, to_date(REGEXP_REPLACE(date, '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE to_date(REGEXP_REPLACE(date, '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') > DATE '2004-10-10'
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC;
Result:
- november 3 , 2004 → surface: carpet (i)
Finding: The only match after October 10, 2004 has surface “carpet (i),” not “hard.”

Step 3 (context): Confirm the October 10, 2004 match itself
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, surface, opponent
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE to_date(REGEXP_REPLACE(date, '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') = DATE '2004-10-10';
Result:
- october 10 , 2004 → surface: hard → opponent: taylor dent

Conclusion:
- On October 10, 2004, the surface was hard. However, after that date, the next recorded match (November 3, 2004) was on carpet (i), not hard. Therefore, the claim that “the surface after October 10, 2004 be hard” is contradicted by the data in this table.

Assumptions:
- “After October 10, 2004” is interpreted as strictly later than 2004-10-10 within the public.ji_nov_k dataset.
- Dates were parsed from text using REGEXP_REPLACE to normalize comma spacing, then to_date(..., 'FMMonth DD, YYYY').
