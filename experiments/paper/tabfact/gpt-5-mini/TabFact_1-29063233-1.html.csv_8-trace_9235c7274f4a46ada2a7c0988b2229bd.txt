Conclusion
- The data shows Lucy Watkins is credited with writing 1 episode in Merlin Series 2, not 6. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “series 2” refers to Merlin Series 2 as represented by the public.merlin_series_2 table, which is the only relevant TV-series table available in the connected data source.
- Writer attribution is taken directly from the "written by" column, matched case-insensitively to the substring "Lucy Watkins".
