Claim to verify: “the away match have a 2 - 3 result.”

Data discovery and schema
- Available data source: postgres_tabfact25 (TabFact) → public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (text), competition (text), "man of the match" (text)

Step 1: Confirm how “away” is represented in the data
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season ORDER BY venue;
Result:
- away
- home

Step 2: Check for any away match with result exactly “2 - 3”
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE venue = 'away' AND result = '2 - 3';
Result:
- count = 0 (no matching rows)

Step 3: See all distinct result values for away matches to assess possible formats
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT result FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE venue = 'away' ORDER BY result ASC;
Results (distinct away-side result values):
- lost 5 - 4
- lost 5 - 6 (ot)
- won 4 - 0
- won 6 - 3
- won 7 - 4

Step 4: List all away matches (for transparency of scores)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result, competition
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE venue = 'away'
ORDER BY date ASC;
Results (as stored):
1) date: 15th, opponent: sheffield scimitars, result: won 7 - 4, competition: league / cup
2) date: 22nd, opponent: wightlink raiders, result: lost 5 - 4, competition: league / cup
3) date: 2nd, opponent: slough jets, result: lost 5 - 6 (ot), competition: league
4) date: 30th, opponent: bracknell bees, result: won 4 - 0, competition: league / cup
5) date: 8th, opponent: swindon wildcats, result: won 6 - 3, competition: league / cup

Step 5: Substring search to catch phrasing like “lost 2 - 3” (not just an exact “2 - 3” value)
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE venue = 'away' AND result ILIKE '%2 - 3%';
Result:
- match_count = 0

Executed SQL (list any matching rows):
SELECT date, opponent, result
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE venue = 'away' AND result ILIKE '%2 - 3%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion
- Within the authoritative dataset available (2008–09 Guildford Flames season table), there are no away matches with a 2 - 3 result (neither exactly “2 - 3” nor embedded within a phrase like “lost 2 - 3”). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “the away match” was interpreted as referring to away fixtures recorded in the available table public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season.
- The “result” field stores text such as “won 6 - 3” or “lost 5 - 4”, so searches accounted for both exact score-only and prefixed formats.
- Analysis is confined to the discovered and accessible dataset; no other seasons/teams were available via the provided data tools.
