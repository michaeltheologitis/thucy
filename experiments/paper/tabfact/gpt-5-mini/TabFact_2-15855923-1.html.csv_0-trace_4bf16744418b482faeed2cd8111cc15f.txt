Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public.
- Inspected schema and found table public.kwak_tae_hwi with columns: date, venue, score, result, competition.
- Queried the table to check whether any game with score = '3 - 2' also has result = '3 - 2'.

Evidence
1) Explore how score and result are represented
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT score, result FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi ORDER BY score NULLS LAST, result NULLS LAST LIMIT 50;
Key returned pair relevant to the claim:
- score = '3 - 2', result = '3 - 2'

2) List all matches where score = '3 - 2'
SQL executed:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2';
Result rows:
- date: february 17 , 2008; venue: chongqing , china; score: 3 - 2; result: 3 - 2; competition: 2008 east asian cup

3) Count matches with score = '3 - 2'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches_with_score_3_2 FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2';
Result:
- total_matches_with_score_3_2: 1

4) Count matches where score = '3 - 2' and result = '3 - 2'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches_with_result_3_2 FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2' AND result = '3 - 2';
Result:
- total_matches_with_result_3_2: 1

Conclusion
- The data show there is a game whose score is '3 - 2' and whose result is also '3 - 2'. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “For the game(s) recorded with a score of 3 - 2 in public.kwak_tae_hwi, the result is 3 - 2.”
- Treated any single matching row as sufficient to verify the statement.
