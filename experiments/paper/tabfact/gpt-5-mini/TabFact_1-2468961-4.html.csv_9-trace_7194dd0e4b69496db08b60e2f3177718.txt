Claim interpreted: “The title of series number 56 is ‘the case of the miss diary.’”

Data source: TabFact PostgreSQL database, public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes

Evidence 1 — Retrieve the title for series number 56:
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "title" FROM list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 56;
Result:
- no in series: 56
- title: sister act

Evidence 2 — Check if any episode has the exact title ‘the case of the miss diary’ (case-insensitive):
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", title FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE lower(title) = 'the case of the miss diary';
Result: 0 rows

Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", title FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE title ILIKE 'the case of the miss diary';
Result: 0 rows

Conclusion: The episode numbered 56 in series has the title “sister act,” not “the case of the miss diary.” No episode in the table has the exact title “the case of the miss diary.” The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “series number 56” is interpreted as the row where the column "no in series" equals 56 in the public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes table.
- Title comparisons in Evidence 2 are exact (case-insensitive) without additional normalization beyond case.
