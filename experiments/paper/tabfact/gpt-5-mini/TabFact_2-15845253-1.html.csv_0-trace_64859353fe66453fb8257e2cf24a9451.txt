Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL instance (TabFact, schema public). One relevant table discovered: viral_disease with columns: family, baltimore group, envelopment, virion shape, replication site.

What the data shows
1) Distinct replication-site values and record counts
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT "replication site" AS replication_site, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM viral_disease
  GROUP BY "replication site"
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result:
  - cytoplasm: 14 records
  - nucleus: 9 records

2) How many distinct viral families have a replication site that includes the nucleus (case-insensitive substring match)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS count FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%';
- Result: 9

3) Which families are these (alphabetical)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT DISTINCT "family" FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%' ORDER BY "family";
- Result (as stored in data):
  - ad enoviridae
  - hepadnaviridae
  - herpesviridae
  - orthomyxoviridae
  - papillomaviridae
  - parvoviridae
  - polyomaviridae
  - retroviridae
  - unassigned

4) Count of families with nucleus replication excluding the non-family label "unassigned"
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS count
  FROM viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%'
    AND "family" IS NOT NULL
    AND lower("family") <> 'unassigned';
- Result: 8

Assessment of the claim
- The dataset contains 9 rows labeled with replication site = nucleus, and 9 distinct values in the family column for those rows. However, one of these is "unassigned", which is not a recognized viral family. Excluding "unassigned" yields 8 recognized viral families with nucleus replication.

Conclusion
- If counting all entries in this dataset where replication site is nucleus (including the non-taxonomic label "unassigned"), the number is 9.
- If strictly counting recognized viral families, the number is 8.

Assumptions and notes
- Each row in viral_disease was treated as one family entry; replication site values observed were exactly 'cytoplasm' or 'nucleus'.
- "Includes the nucleus" was implemented via case-insensitive substring match, though in this dataset the value appears as exactly 'nucleus'.
- The entry "ad enoviridae" appears to be a typographical variant of Adenoviridae in the source data; results are reported exactly as stored.
- "Unassigned" is not a viral family; whether to include it depends on interpretation of "viral family" in the claim.
