Claim evaluated: “the tournament in cardiff, great britain [was] on april 4, 2011.”

Data sources consulted: TabFact database (public schema), table: alex_bogdanovic (columns: date text, tournament text, surface text, opponent in the final text, score text).

Step 1 — Identify any tournaments in Cardiff, Great Britain
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, tournament FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE tournament ILIKE '%cardiff%';
- Result:
  - 16 april 2007 | cardiff , great britain

Step 2 — Check what tournament occurred on 4 April 2011
- Executed SQL (broad search for April 2011, then narrowed to the exact day):
  SELECT * FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE LOWER(date) ~ '\\m4\\M' AND LOWER(date) LIKE '%apr%' AND LOWER(date) LIKE '%2011%';
- Result:
  - date: 4 april 2011
  - tournament: little rock , ar , usa f9
  - surface: hard
  - opponent in the final: arnau brugués - davi
  - score: 3 - 6 , 1 - 6

Step 3 — Explicitly verify there is no Cardiff tournament in 2011
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, tournament FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE tournament ILIKE '%cardiff%' AND date LIKE '%2011%';
- Result: No rows returned.

Findings:
- The only Cardiff, Great Britain entry in this dataset is dated 16 April 2007, not 4 April 2011.
- On 4 April 2011, the recorded tournament location is Little Rock, AR, USA (F9), not Cardiff.

Conclusion: The claim that a tournament in Cardiff, Great Britain was on April 4, 2011 is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the records.

Assumptions and scope:
- The alex_bogdanovic table is treated as authoritative for the tournaments/finals it records. Dates are stored as text; searches were performed case-insensitively using substring and regex matching.
- Interpretation of the user’s statement: verifying whether there exists a tournament entry located in “cardiff, great britain” dated “4 april 2011.”
