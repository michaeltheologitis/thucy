Claim to verify: “the detroit piston lose over 8 game during this period of their 2010 - 2011 season.”

Interpretation used for verification
- I interpret “this period” as the span of games represented in the available 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season table (games 62 through 73, dated March 1 to March 26). The question asks whether Detroit lost more than 8 games within that period.

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record)

What the data shows
1) The table covers a 12-game slice (games 62–73) of the 2010–11 season.
   - SQL:
     SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
   - Result: {"min_game": 62, "max_game": 73}
   - SQL:
     SELECT game, date FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE game = (SELECT MIN(game) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season) OR game = (SELECT MAX(game) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season) ORDER BY game;
   - Results:
     {"game": 62, "date": "march 1"}
     {"game": 73, "date": "march 26"}

2) There are 12 rows total; among them, 8 are losses (score starts with “l”) and 4 are wins (score starts with “w”).
   - SQL (total rows):
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
   - Result: total_rows = 12
   - SQL (prefix distribution):
     SELECT CASE WHEN score IS NULL OR score = '' THEN 'NULL/empty' WHEN lower(score) LIKE 'w%' THEN 'w' WHEN lower(score) LIKE 'l%' THEN 'l' ELSE 'other' END AS prefix_category, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season GROUP BY prefix_category ORDER BY prefix_category;
   - Results:
     prefix_category = 'l', count = 8
     prefix_category = 'w', count = 4

3) Explicit list of the 8 losses in this period (games 62–73):
   - SQL:
     SELECT game, date, team, score, record FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE score ILIKE 'l%' ORDER BY game;
   - Results:
     - game 62 | date: march 1 | team: milwaukee | score: l 90 - 92 (ot) | record: 22 - 40
     - game 63 | date: march 2 | team: minnesota | score: l 105 - 116 (ot) | record: 22 - 41
     - game 65 | date: march 9 | team: san antonio | score: l 104 - 111 (ot) | record: 23 - 42
     - game 66 | date: march 11 | team: oklahoma city | score: l 94 - 104 (ot) | record: 23 - 43
     - game 67 | date: march 12 | team: denver | score: l 101 - 131 (ot) | record: 23 - 44
     - game 70 | date: march 20 | team: atlanta | score: l 96 - 104 (ot) | record: 25 - 45
     - game 71 | date: march 23 | team: miami | score: l 94 - 100 (ot) | record: 25 - 46
     - game 72 | date: march 25 | team: cleveland | score: l 91 - 97 (ot) | record: 25 - 47

Conclusion
- In the available period (games 62–73), Detroit lost exactly 8 games, not more than 8. Therefore, the claim that they “lose over 8 game during this period” is not supported by the data.

Notes
- The final row in this slice shows a cumulative season record of 26–47 as of game 73, but that reflects season-to-date results, not losses within just this 12-game period. For verifying the claim about losses “during this period,” the correct metric is the count of loss rows within the period, which is 8.

Assumptions
- “This period” refers to the span of games present in the table (games 62–73, March 1–March 26). If instead the claim intended the entire 2010–11 season, that is a different scope than what this table fully covers; I did not extrapolate beyond the available rows.
