Claim to verify: “the Toronto Blue Jays lose 3 consecutive game between the 25th and the 28 May 1991.”

Summary conclusion: Supported by the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays game log. The Jays lost on May 25, May 26, and May 28, 1991. There was no game on May 27, so these are three consecutive team games all resulting in losses within the stated dates.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL (public schema) with a season table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season.
  • Discovery tool output: “Accessible data source is a PostgreSQL instance (public schema)… table named t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (owner: guest_user).”

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Resulting schema (key columns): date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text. No PK or FKs.

Row sampling (to understand formats)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 15;
- Observations: date is stored as lowercase month and day (e.g., “may 1”), record is cumulative team record “W - L”. The score formatting is textual and ambiguous for perspective, so win/loss is best inferred via changes in the cumulative record.

Verification step 1: Compute May results via record deltas (May 20–31 view)
- Executed SQL:
  WITH may AS (
    SELECT *, regexp_replace(date,'^\s*may\s+([0-9]+).*$','\1')::int AS day,
           split_part(record,' - ',1)::int AS wins,
           split_part(record,' - ',2)::int AS losses
    FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
    WHERE date ILIKE 'may %'
  ), with_lag AS (
    SELECT date, day, score, record, wins, losses,
           LAG(wins) OVER (ORDER BY day) AS prev_wins,
           LAG(losses) OVER (ORDER BY day) AS prev_losses
    FROM may
  )
  SELECT date, day, score, record, wins, losses, prev_wins, prev_losses,
         CASE
           WHEN wins = prev_wins + 1 THEN 'W'
           WHEN losses = prev_losses + 1 THEN 'L'
           ELSE 'N/A' END AS result
  FROM with_lag
  WHERE day BETWEEN 20 AND 31
  ORDER BY day;
- Returned (relevant rows):
  • May 25: score 5 - 0, record 25 - 18 → result: L
  • May 26: score 6 - 2, record 25 - 19 → result: L
  • May 28: score 8 - 4, record 25 - 20 → result: L

Verification step 2: Show opponents and confirm no game on May 27
- Executed SQL (plus initial quick inspect noted by tool):
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT date, opponent, score, record,
      (split_part(record,' - ',1))::int as wins,
      to_date('1991 '|| initcap(date),'YYYY Mon DD') as game_date
    FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
  ), withlag AS (
    SELECT *, lag(wins) OVER (ORDER BY game_date) as prev_wins
    FROM parsed
  )
  SELECT date, opponent, score, record,
    CASE WHEN wins > prev_wins THEN 'W' ELSE 'L' END as result
  FROM withlag
  WHERE date IN ('may 24','may 25','may 26','may 27','may 28','may 29')
  ORDER BY game_date;
- Returned rows:
  • may 24 | angels    | 3 - 2 | 25 - 17 | W
  • may 25 | angels    | 5 - 0 | 25 - 18 | L
  • may 26 | angels    | 6 - 2 | 25 - 19 | L
  • may 27 | (no game recorded)
  • may 28 | athletics | 8 - 4 | 25 - 20 | L
  • may 29 | athletics | 8 - 3 | 26 - 20 | W

Verification step 3: Count losses between May 25 and May 28 inclusive
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses_count FROM (
    SELECT to_date(initcap(date) || ' 1991', 'Mon DD YYYY') AS game_date,
           CAST(split_part(record, ' - ', 1) AS integer) AS wins,
           CAST(split_part(record, ' - ', 1) AS integer) -
           LAG(CAST(split_part(record, ' - ', 1) AS integer)) OVER (
             ORDER BY to_date(initcap(date) || ' 1991', 'Mon DD YYYY')
           ) AS wins_delta
    FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
  ) t
  WHERE game_date BETWEEN DATE '1991-05-25' AND DATE '1991-05-28'
    AND (wins_delta = 0 OR wins_delta IS NULL);
- Result: losses_count = 3

Conclusion
- The data show the Toronto Blue Jays lost three consecutive games within the period May 25 to May 28, 1991 (losses on May 25, May 26, and May 28; no game on May 27). Therefore, the claim is verified.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “between the 25th and the 28 May 1991” as inclusive of both dates.
- “Consecutive game” interpreted as consecutive team games (off-days are allowed between games) rather than consecutive calendar days.
- The table is specifically for the 1991 season; the date column lacks a year, so 1991 was added when parsing dates for ordering and comparison.
- Win/loss determination is based on changes in the cumulative record, which is unambiguous given the dataset’s format.
