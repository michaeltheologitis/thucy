Scope and data sources
- Verified against the only available authoritative dataset: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8), table public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs. This table includes a continent column used to determine geographic location.

Key evidence from the data
1) How “Europe” is represented
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT continent FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs ORDER BY continent;
Result:
- asia
- europe
- oceania
- s america
Interpretation: The table uses the lowercase value "europe" for the European continent.

2) How many clubs are located in Europe
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS exact_match_count FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE continent = 'europe';
Result: exact_match_count = 9

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ci_match_count FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower(continent) = 'europe';
Result: ci_match_count = 9

SQL:
SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs GROUP BY continent ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- europe: 9
- oceania: 2
- asia: 2
- s america: 1
Interpretation: There are 9 clubs in Europe in this dataset (not one).

3) Which clubs are listed in Europe
SQL:
SELECT "football club" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower("continent") = 'europe' ORDER BY "football club" ASC;
Results:
- ac milan
- ac sparta prague
- fc basel 1893
- fc midtjylland
- rangers fc
- rsc anderlecht
- team england
- team luxembourg
- team netherlands
Interpretation: Multiple European clubs are present.

4) Does “team brazil” exist and where is it located
SQL:
SELECT "no", "football club", "continent", "associated football club", "seasons", "racing drivers"
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%brazil%';
Result:
- no: 14; football club: team brazil; continent: s america; associated football club: none; seasons: 2011; racing drivers: antônio pizzonia
Interpretation: “team brazil” is present but located in “s america,” not Europe.

Conclusion
- The claim that “team brazil [is] the only football club located on the European continent” is contradicted by the data. The dataset shows 9 European clubs, and “team brazil” is located in South America, not Europe.

Assumptions and interpretation
- Interpreted “located on the European continent” using the continent column in the only available dataset.
- Interpreted “team brazil” as the row named exactly “team brazil” in the table.
