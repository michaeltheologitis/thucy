Summary conclusion
- Yes. In the available season data, the game against Minnesota had higher attendance (18,478) than the game against New Orleans (17,781).

What I checked and found
1) Discovered data sources
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Finding: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema was available. No other sources were accessible.

2) Inspected schema to understand relevant tables
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Result: Table public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season with columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text).

3) Located rows for Minnesota and New Orleans and extracted attendance
- Evidence query A (initial filter to locate candidate rows):
  SQL: SELECT date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE team ILIKE '%Minn%' OR team ILIKE '%New Orl%';
  Result rows:
  - april 8 — new orleans — new orleans arena 17781
  - april 11 — minnesota — target center 18478

- Evidence query B (exact match for the two teams to confirm and view raw text):
  SQL: SELECT date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE team IN ('minnesota','new orleans');
  Results:
  - date: april 8, team: new orleans, location attendance: new orleans arena 17781
  - date: april 11, team: minnesota, location attendance: target center 18478

- Evidence query C (extract the numeric attendance values as integers):
  SQL: SELECT date, team, replace(substring("location attendance" from '(\d+)'),',','')::integer AS attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE team IN ('minnesota','new orleans');
  Results:
  - date: april 8, team: new orleans, attendance: 17781
  - date: april 11, team: minnesota, attendance: 18478

- Evidence query D (identify which is higher):
  SQL: SELECT team, attendance FROM ( SELECT team, replace(substring("location attendance" from '(\d+)'),',','')::integer AS attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE team IN ('minnesota','new orleans') ) t ORDER BY attendance DESC LIMIT 1;
  Result:
  - team: minnesota, attendance: 18478

Conclusion based on data
- The Minnesota game attendance (18,478) is greater than the New Orleans game attendance (17,781). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- The table t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season represents the Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season, and the "team" column lists the opponent (stored in lowercase).
- The "location attendance" field ends with the numeric attendance; I extracted the trailing digits as attendance.
- Only the rows present for "minnesota" and "new orleans" in this table were considered, which yielded one game each.
