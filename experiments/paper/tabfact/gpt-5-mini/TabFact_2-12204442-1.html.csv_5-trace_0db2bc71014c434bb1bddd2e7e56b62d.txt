Claim interpreted: A drop tower with a 272-foot drop was open before March 22, 2003.

Data source consulted
- Database: postgres_tabfact22 (public schema)
- Table: drop_tower_scream_zone (columns: park, tower height, drop height, speed, model, opened, height requirement) — all stored as text

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any entries with a 272 ft drop
Executed SQL #1:
SELECT park, "drop height", opened, "tower height", model,
       NULLIF(regexp_replace("drop height",'[^0-9.]','','g'), '') AS drop_num_text,
       CASE WHEN regexp_replace("drop height",'[^0-9.]','','g') ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN (regexp_replace("drop height",'[^0-9.]','','g'))::float ELSE NULL END AS drop_num
FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone
WHERE ("drop height" ILIKE '%272%')
   OR (
       regexp_replace("drop height",'[^0-9.]','','g') ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
       AND (regexp_replace("drop height",'[^0-9.]','','g'))::float BETWEEN 270 AND 274
   );

Result row:
{ park: "kings dominion", drop height: "272feet", opened: "march 22 , 2003", tower height: "305feet", model: "gyro drop", drop_num_text: "272", drop_num: 272 }

2) Parse the opened field into a date and compare to 2003-03-22
Executed SQL #2:
SELECT park, "drop height", opened, to_date(initcap(regexp_replace(opened,'\s+,\s+',', ', 'g')), 'Month DD, YYYY') AS opened_date
FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone
WHERE "drop height" ILIKE '%272%';

Result row:
{ park: "kings dominion", drop height: "272feet", opened: "march 22 , 2003", opened_date: "2003-03-22" }

Analysis
- The entry with a 272-foot drop exists (at Kings Dominion; model: Gyro Drop).
- Its opened date is 2003-03-22, which is the same day as March 22, 2003, not before it.

Conclusion
- The part asserting a 272-foot drop is supported.
- The claim that it was open before March 22, 2003 is not supported. The data shows it opened on March 22, 2003 (not earlier).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the drop height of 272 foot” as referencing any entry where the drop height is approximately 272 feet in the drop_tower_scream_zone table.
- Treated “be open before March 22, 2003” as requiring the opened date to be strictly earlier than 2003-03-22.
- No separate ride name column exists; I identified the record by park and model.
