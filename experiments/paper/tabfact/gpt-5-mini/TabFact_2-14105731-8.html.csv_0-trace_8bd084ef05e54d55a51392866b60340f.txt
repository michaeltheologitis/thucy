Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.my_info_table containing columns: episode (bigint), season (bigint), format (text), title (text), original airdate (text).
- Queried the table to extract the format associated with season = 6.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Determine distinct format values for season 6
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT format FROM public.my_info_table WHERE season = 6 ORDER BY format NULLS LAST;
Result:
[{"format":"q145"}]

2) Show supporting rows for season 6
SQL executed:
SELECT format, episode, title FROM public.my_info_table WHERE season = 6 ORDER BY format, episode NULLS LAST;
Result:
[{"episode":222,"format":"q145","title":"denisa 's greedy doll / denisa 's slumber party"}]

Conclusion:
- The data shows that for season 6, the format is q145. This directly supports the claim that "the format of season 6 be q145."

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as: The value of the column "format" for rows where season = 6 equals "q145" in public.my_info_table.
- Treated “be q145” as “is q145.”
