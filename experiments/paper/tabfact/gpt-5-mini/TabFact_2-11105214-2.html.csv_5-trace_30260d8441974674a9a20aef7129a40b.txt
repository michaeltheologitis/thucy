Data source explored

Evidence gathered
1) Query to retrieve swing-to-gain values for Dundee West and Western Isles:
SQL:
SELECT constituency, "swing to gain"
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE constituency ILIKE '%Dundee%' OR constituency ILIKE '%Western%';
Result:

- western isles: 2.91

2) Exact-match confirmation query:
SQL:
SELECT rank, constituency, "swing to gain"
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE constituency IN ('dundee west', 'western isles')
ORDER BY rank;
Result rows:
- rank 5 | dundee west | 2.13
- rank 6 | western isles | 2.91
