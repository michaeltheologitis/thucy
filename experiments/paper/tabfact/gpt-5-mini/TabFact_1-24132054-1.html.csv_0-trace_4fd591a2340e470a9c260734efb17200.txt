Claim to verify: More viewers in the US watched Dexter Season 3 Episode 4 than Episode 2.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4)
- Relevant table: public.dexter_season_3
  - Columns include: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), title (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text), among others.

Evidence query and results:
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "us viewers (millions)"::numeric AS us_viewers_millions
FROM public.dexter_season_3
WHERE "no in season" IN (2, 4)
ORDER BY "no in season";

Results:
- Episode 2 (no in season: 2) | No in series: 26 | Title: finding freebo | US viewers (millions): 0.79
- Episode 4 (no in season: 4) | No in series: 28 | Title: all in the family | US viewers (millions): 0.86

Interpretation:
- 0.86 million (Episode 4) > 0.79 million (Episode 2). Therefore, Episode 4 had more U.S. viewers than Episode 2 in Season 3.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data from public.dexter_season_3.

Assumptions:
- The column "us viewers (millions)" represents the U.S. viewership per episode in millions and is authoritative for Season 3 of Dexter.
- The table public.dexter_season_3 exclusively contains Season 3 episodes, so filtering by episode numbers 2 and 4 correctly targets the intended episodes.
