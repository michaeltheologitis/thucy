Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1961_vfl_season
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine the highest recorded crowd in the 1961 VFL season
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season;
- Result:
  max_crowd = 49678

2) Get the match details for the maximum attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT "date","home team","away team","venue","crowd"
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  WHERE crowd = (SELECT MAX(crowd) FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season)
  ORDER BY "date";
- Result row(s):
  {"date":"3 june 1961","home team":"melbourne","away team":"carlton","venue":"mcg","crowd":49678}

3) Compare maximum attendance by venue (to see where Lake Oval ranks)
- SQL:
  SELECT venue, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  GROUP BY venue
  ORDER BY max_crowd DESC;
- Result (top to bottom):
  - mcg — 49678
  - victoria park — 28290
  - kardinia park — 18683
  - glenferrie oval — 15000
  - lake oval — 14500
  - arden street oval — 13000

4) List all 1961 matches at Lake Oval to confirm its highest crowd
- SQL:
  SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", crowd, venue
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  WHERE venue ILIKE '%Lake Oval%'
  ORDER BY crowd DESC;
- Result:
  - 3 June 1961 — South Melbourne vs Fitzroy — Crowd: 14500 — Venue: lake oval

Conclusion
- The highest recorded crowd in the 1961 VFL season was 49,678 at the MCG (Melbourne vs Carlton, 3 June 1961).
- Lake Oval’s highest recorded crowd that season was 14,500, which is well below the season’s maximum and ranks below several other venues.
- Therefore, the claim that Lake Oval recorded the highest crowd participation during the 1961 VFL season is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- "Highest crowd participation" is interpreted as the single-match maximum attendance.
- The table public.t_1961_vfl_season contains all official VFL matches for the 1961 season with accurate venues and crowds.
