Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources and inspected the schema to find any tables containing team game leaders for points and rebounds. The only relevant table available was a 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season summary with per-game team leaders.
- I then queried this table to count and list games where Travis Outlaw led the Nets in both points and rebounds in the same game.

What the data contains
- The table public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season contains 7 rows, covering late-season games for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets, with columns for team high points and high rebounds leaders in each game.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Preview of the table (to confirm format and scope)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists", "location attendance", record FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 10;
Result: 7 rows returned (games 75–81). Example rows include formats like "player name (number)" in lowercase, e.g., "brook lopez (39)".

2) Total number of rows in the table (to confirm scope)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Result:
- {row_count: 7}

3) Count of games where Travis Outlaw led both points and rebounds
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%travis outlaw%' AND "high rebounds" ILIKE '%travis outlaw%';
Result:
- count = 0

4) Any games where Travis Outlaw appears as a leader in either points or rebounds (for context)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, "high points", "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%travis outlaw%' OR "high rebounds" ILIKE '%travis outlaw%';
Result:
- One game: game 76 (april 3) — high points: deron williams (18); high rebounds: travis outlaw (9)

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (7 late-season games for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets), Travis Outlaw did not lead his team in both points and rebounds in the same game even once. Therefore, the claim that he did so “3 different time” is not supported by the data available here.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Leading is interpreted as the player listed in the 'high points' and 'high rebounds' columns for a given game; ties (if any) would still match via the substring name search. Names are matched case-insensitively.
- The accessible data covers only 7 Nets games from the 2010–11 season. I treated the available data as authoritative within its scope, but note it is not a complete career or full-season dataset. The verdict reflects the claim against the accessible data.
