Claim interpreted: “There are 96 goals achieved when the club is Chievo and the debut is after 1999.” I interpret this as: in the table of football records in Italy, for any entry whose current club is Chievo and whose debut year is after 1999, the goals value should be 96.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14)
- Table: public.football_records_in_italy (columns: rank, all - time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, apps)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find entries where current club is Chievo and debut year > 1999
SQL:
SELECT "name", "debut year", "current club", "goals", "apps"
FROM public.football_records_in_italy
WHERE lower("current club") = 'chievo' AND "debut year" > 1999;
Result:
- name: sergio pellissier; debut year: 2002; current club: chievo; goals: 86; apps: 333

2) Broader check: any entry with current club containing 'chievo' and debut year > 1999
SQL:
SELECT name, "current club", "debut year", goals, apps
FROM public.football_records_in_italy
WHERE lower("current club") LIKE '%chievo%' AND "debut year" > 1999
ORDER BY name;
Result:
- sergio pellissier | chievo | 2002 | 86 | 333

3) Check if any Chievo entry has exactly 96 goals (regardless of debut year)
SQL:
SELECT name, "debut year", "current club", goals
FROM public.football_records_in_italy
WHERE lower("current club") LIKE '%chievo%'
  AND goals = 96;
Result: No rows found

Conclusion
- The only relevant entry (current club Chievo, debut after 1999) has 86 goals, not 96. No Chievo-associated entry with 96 goals exists in the dataset.

Assumptions
- “club which debut after 1999” refers to the player’s debut year > 1999 (column: debut year).
- “Chievo” is matched case-insensitively against the current club field.
- “goals achieved” maps to the goals column in the table.
