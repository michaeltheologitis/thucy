Scope and data sources explored:
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact25/TabFact) with a public schema. One table found: public.my_info_table.
- Schema of public.my_info_table: columns — "ntfa div 1" (text), wins (bigint), byes (bigint), losses (bigint), draws (bigint), against (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Locate team entry and its draws value for “bridgenorth” (case-insensitive exact match).
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT "ntfa div 1", draws FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("ntfa div 1") = 'bridgenorth';
   Result:
   - ntfa div 1: bridgenorth
   - draws: 0

Conclusion:
- The table contains an entry for “bridgenorth” with draws = 0. This directly supports the claim that the total number of draw for bridgenorth is 0.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “draw” as the draws column in the table, representing the total number of drawn matches for the team.
- Treated team matching as case-insensitive exact match on the "ntfa div 1" column.
- The verification is within the scope of the available dataset (single table) without season/context metadata beyond what is present.
