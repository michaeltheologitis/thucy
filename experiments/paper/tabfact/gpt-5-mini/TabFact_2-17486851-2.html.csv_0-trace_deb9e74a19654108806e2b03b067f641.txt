Claim to verify: “Paulo Costa be moving to Anorthosis Famagusta during the transfer window.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one accessible table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season. Columns include nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee, source, which are directly relevant to transfer activity.

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Query to locate any entry referencing Paulo Costa or Anorthosis Famagusta:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE '%Paulo Costa%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%Anorthosis%';
Result: 1 row
- nat: por
- name: paulo costa
- moving to: anorthosis famagusta
- type: mutual consent loan return
- transfer window: winter
- transfer fee: free
- source: apoelfccomcy

2) Query to list all transfer records for Paulo Costa (to confirm uniqueness and details):
SQL:
SELECT nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
WHERE name ILIKE 'Paulo Costa';
Result: 1 row (same as above)
- nat: por
- name: paulo costa
- moving to: anorthosis famagusta
- type: mutual consent loan return
- transfer window: winter
- transfer fee: free
- source: apoelfccomcy

Conclusion:
- The database contains a direct record that Paulo Costa moved to Anorthosis Famagusta during the winter transfer window, with the move characterized as a mutual consent loan return and no transfer fee (free). This supports the claim that he was moving to Anorthosis Famagusta during a transfer window.

Assumptions and notes:
- Matching used case-insensitive string matching (ILIKE). The table pertains to transfer activity associated with the 2008–09 season context, but the claim does not specify a season. Within the available authoritative data, the move is recorded as described.
