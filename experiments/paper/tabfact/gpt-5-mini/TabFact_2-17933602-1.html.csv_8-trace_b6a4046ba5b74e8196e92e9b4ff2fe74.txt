Claim components:
- Porto finished 1st in the 2003–2004 Liga (Primeira Liga): Supported by data.
- Benfica followed (2nd place): Supported by data.
- Both clubs are from the city of Porto: Contradicted by data (Benfica is from Lisbon; Porto is from Porto).

Evidence from the database
1) Full table scan of relevant columns
Executed SQL:
SELECT club, city, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga;

Key returned rows (club — city — "2003 - 2004 season"):
- porto — porto — 1st in the liga
- benfica — lisbon — 2nd in the liga
(Other rows omitted here for brevity; full result set included Porto=1st, Benfica=2nd, and cities for each club.)

2) Direct check for Porto and Benfica
Executed SQL:
SELECT club, city, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE lower(club) IN ('porto','benfica');

Results:
- club: benfica, city: lisbon, 2003 - 2004 season: 2nd in the liga
- club: porto, city: porto, 2003 - 2004 season: 1st in the liga

Conclusion
- Standings portion of the claim (Porto 1st, Benfica 2nd in 2003–2004) is correct.
- Geographic portion of the claim is incorrect: Benfica is from Lisbon, not Porto.

Assumptions made:
- "liga" refers to Portugal’s top flight (Primeira Liga).
- "follow by benfica" means Benfica placed 2nd.
- The column named "2003 - 2004 season" in table t_2004_05_primeira_liga represents each club’s finish in that season.
