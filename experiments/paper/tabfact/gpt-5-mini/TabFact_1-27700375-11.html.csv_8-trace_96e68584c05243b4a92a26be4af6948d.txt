Claim to verify: “Jordan Farmar led the team in points for 5 straight games.”

How I interpreted the claim
- I verified whether Jordan Farmar was the Nets’ team-leading scorer in points for five consecutive games within the NBA data available to me. The only accessible dataset concerns the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season (and, as shown below, only games 75–81 are present).

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all rows to understand coverage and see team high scorers by game
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season ORDER BY game;
Result (7 rows):
- game: 75, date: april 1, score: l 90 - 115 (ot), high points: brandan wright (15)
- game: 76, date: april 3, score: l 94 - 108 (ot), high points: deron williams (18)
- game: 77, date: april 5, score: w 107 - 105 (ot), high points: brook lopez (30)
- game: 78, date: april 6, score: l 109 - 116 (ot), high points: brook lopez (39)
- game: 79, date: april 8, score: l 93 - 116 (ot), high points: brook lopez (27)
- game: 80, date: april 10, score: l 92 - 99 (ot), high points: brook lopez (35)
- game: 81, date: april 11, score: l 103 - 105 (ot), high points: brook lopez (31)

2) Identify any games where Jordan Farmar was listed among the team’s high scorers (including ties)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Farmar%' ORDER BY game;
Result: 0 rows (no occurrences of “Farmar” in the high points field).

3) Compute the longest consecutive streak of games where Jordan Farmar appears in the team high-points field
SQL executed:
WITH t AS (
  SELECT game, date, score, "high points", (CASE WHEN "high points" ILIKE '%Farmar%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS is_farmar
  FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
  ORDER BY game
), grp AS (
  SELECT *, sum(CASE WHEN is_farmar=0 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) OVER (ORDER BY game) AS grp
  FROM t
)
SELECT COALESCE(MAX(cnt),0) AS longest_streak
FROM (
  SELECT grp, count(*) AS cnt
  FROM grp
  WHERE is_farmar=1
  GROUP BY grp
) s;
Result: longest_streak = 0

Findings
- In the accessible dataset (games 75–81 of the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets), Jordan Farmar does not appear even once as the team’s high points scorer, and thus he certainly does not lead for five consecutive games within this data.

Conclusion
- Based on the available evidence, the claim is not supported.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Only one table was available: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season, and it contains seven rows (games 75–81). I treated this dataset as authoritative within its scope. The claim could refer to another season or team from Jordan Farmar’s career, but no additional seasons/teams were accessible in the connected data. I considered any appearance of “Farmar” in the “high points” text (including ties) as leading the team in points.
