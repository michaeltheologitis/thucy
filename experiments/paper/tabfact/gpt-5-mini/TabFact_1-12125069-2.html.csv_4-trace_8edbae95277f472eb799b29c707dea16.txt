Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. For the 2005 Texas Rangers season, the winning pitcher on June 24 was Roy Oswalt (Houston), not Chris Young. Chris Young was the winning pitcher on June 25.

Evidence from the database (TabFact, table public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season):

1) Query: Identify the game on June 24
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", location FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date ILIKE '%June 24%';
- Result:
  - date: june 24
  - winning team: houston
  - score: 5 - 2
  - winning pitcher: roy oswalt
  - losing pitcher: ricardo rodríguez
  - location: houston

2) Query: Check all games where Chris Young was the winning pitcher
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", location
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE "winning pitcher" ILIKE '%Chris Young%';
- Results:
  - may 21 | texas | 18 - 3 | chris young | ezequiel astacio | arlington
  - june 25 | texas | 6 - 5 | chris young | brandon backe | houston

Assessment:
- On June 24, the winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt (Houston). Therefore, the statement that the winning pitcher on June 24 was Chris Young is contradicted by the data. Notably, Chris Young was the winning pitcher the following day, June 25.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the 2005 Texas Rangers season (the only available dataset discovered).
- Date matching used a case-insensitive substring search on the text-based date field.
- No other seasons or leagues were available in the accessible data sources to cross-check alternate contexts for “June 24.”
