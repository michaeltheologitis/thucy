Claim to verify: “From 1965–1970, there were 998,000 deaths per year and 3,330,000 live births per year.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact33), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table, which contains period and per-year vital statistics (live births per year, deaths per year, natural change per year, etc.).

Evidence collected
1) Locate the record for the 1965–1970 period and read per-year values
- Executed SQL:
SELECT period, "live births per year", "deaths per year", "natural change per year"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE trim(period) ~* '^(1965\s*-\s*1970|1965\s*–\s*1970|1965\s*—\s*1970|1965\s+to\s+1970)$';
- Result:
  - period: 1965 - 1970
  - live births per year: 3 330 000
  - deaths per year: 998 000
  - natural change per year: 2 332 000

2) Cast the textual per-year values to integers to confirm exact numbers
- Executed SQL:
SELECT period,
       CAST(REPLACE("live births per year", ' ', '') AS INTEGER) AS live_births_per_year,
       CAST(REPLACE("deaths per year", ' ', '') AS INTEGER) AS deaths_per_year,
       CAST(REPLACE("natural change per year", ' ', '') AS INTEGER) AS natural_change_per_year
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE period = '1965 - 1970';
- Result:
  - period: 1965 - 1970
  - live_births_per_year: 3330000
  - deaths_per_year: 998000
  - natural_change_per_year: 2332000

Assessment
- The database record for the period 1965–1970 reports exactly 3,330,000 live births per year and 998,000 deaths per year. This directly supports the claim.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the same scope as the dataset’s “1965 - 1970” period (which presents per-year figures averaged over that multi-year period). The dataset does not specify geographic scope in the schema; I treated the table as the authoritative source for the claim as stated.
