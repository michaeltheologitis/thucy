- Table: public.list_of_leverage_episodes
  - Columns: series (bigint), season (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), original air date (text), us viewers (in millions) (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Retrieve the episode with series number 50 and its viewers
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "season", "title", "us viewers (in millions)" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE "series" = 50;
- Result:
  season: 6
  title: the carnival job
  us viewers (in millions): 3.38

2) Confirm uniqueness of series number 50
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_series_50 FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE series = 50;
- Result:
  count_series_50 = 1

Conclusion:
- The row with series = 50 reports US viewers (in millions) = 3.38. This directly supports the claim that “series number 50” has 3.38 million viewers.

Assumptions made:
- “series number 50” refers to the value in the column named series in the list_of_leverage_episodes table.
- “viewer” refers to the column us viewers (in millions), which measures US audience size in millions.
