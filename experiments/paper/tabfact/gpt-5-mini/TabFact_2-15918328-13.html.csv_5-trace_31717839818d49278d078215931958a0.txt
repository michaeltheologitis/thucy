Claim interpreted: “Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced a jazz style and were safe.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25), schema public
- Relevant table: so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 (columns: couple, style, music, choreographer (s), results)

Evidence
1) Retrieve all entries for the couple “Katee Shean” and “Joshua Allen”
Executed SQL:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE couple ILIKE '%Katee Shean%'
  AND couple ILIKE '%Joshua Allen%';
Results:
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: contemporary | music: all by myself - celine dion | choreographer (s): tyce diorio | results: safe
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: paso doble | music: filet from le rêve | choreographer (s): jason gilkison | results: safe

2) Check how jazz routines are recorded and if any exist
Executed SQL:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE style ILIKE '%jazz%';
Count SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS jazz_count
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE style ILIKE '%jazz%';
Results:
- One jazz entry exists in the table:
  couple: courtney galiano mark kanemura | style: jazz | music: the garden- mirah | choreographer (s): sonya tayeh | results: kanemura eliminated
- jazz_count: 1

3) Explicitly verify whether Katee/Joshua had any jazz entries
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE (couple ILIKE '%Katee Shean%' OR couple ILIKE '%Joshua Allen%')
  AND style ILIKE '%jazz%';
Executed SQL (rows):
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE (couple ILIKE '%Katee Shean%' OR couple ILIKE '%Joshua Allen%')
  AND style ILIKE '%jazz%';
Results:
- match_count: 0
- No rows returned

Assessment
- “Were safe”: Supported. For the two recorded routines by Katee Shean & Joshua Allen (contemporary; paso doble), the results are “safe.”
- “Danced a jazz style”: Not supported. No entries show Katee Shean & Joshua Allen performing a jazz routine; the only jazz entry in the table involves Courtney Galiano & Mark Kanemura.

Conclusion
- The claim combines a true element (they were safe) with a false element (that they danced jazz). Overall: partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the So You Think You Can Dance U.S. Season 4 couple entries as represented in the table so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4. I used case-insensitive substring matching for names and styles.
