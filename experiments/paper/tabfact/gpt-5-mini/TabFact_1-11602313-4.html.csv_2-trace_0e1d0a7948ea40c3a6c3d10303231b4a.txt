Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a table containing Intel Pentium Dual-Core microprocessor specifications.
- Inspected the relevant schema to locate fields for model name, part numbers, and FSB speed.
- Queried for the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 to verify its part number and FSB.

Data sources and schema
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
  - Relevant columns: "model number", "sspec number", "fsb", "part number (s)"

Executed SQL (evidence)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "fsb", "part number (s)" FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE "model number" ILIKE '%T3200%';

Result:
- model number: pentium dual - core t3200
- sspec number: slavg (m0)
- fsb: 667 mt / s
- part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m

Findings
- The entry for "pentium dual - core t3200" shows an FSB of "667 mt / s" and a part number listed as "lf80537 gf0411 m".

Conclusion
- The claim that the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 has a part number "lf80537 gf0411 m" and an FSB of "667 mt / s" is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Matching was performed case-insensitively on model number using ILIKE '%T3200%'.
