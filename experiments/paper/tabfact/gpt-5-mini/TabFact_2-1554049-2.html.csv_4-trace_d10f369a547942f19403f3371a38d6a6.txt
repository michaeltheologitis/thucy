Conclusion: In the available dataset, there is no tournament where the opponent was Roger Federer and the surface was carpet. The only row involving Roger Federer is on clay, and the only carpet entry involves a different opponent (David Nalbandian).

Evidence from the data (with exact executed SQL):

1) Check distinct surface values to confirm whether any carpet entries exist
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE surface IS NOT NULL ORDER BY surface ASC;
- Result: carpet (i), clay, hard

2) Direct search for rows with opponent containing 'federer' and surface containing 'carpet'
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%federer%' AND surface ILIKE '%carpet%';
- Result: cnt = 0 (no matches)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%federer%' AND surface ILIKE '%carpet%';
- Result: no rows returned

3) Show the row(s) where opponent contains 'federer' (to see the actual surface and tournament)
- SQL: SELECT tournament, date, opponent, score, surface FROM ji_nov_k WHERE lower(opponent) LIKE '%federer%';
- Result: tournament = gstaad , switzerland; date = july 13 , 2003; opponent = roger federer; score = 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 3; surface = clay

4) Show the row(s) where surface contains 'carpet' (to see the tournament and opponent actually recorded on carpet)
- SQL: SELECT tournament, date, opponent, score, surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE surface ILIKE '%carpet%';
- Result: tournament = basel , switzerland; date = november 3 , 2004; opponent = david nalbandian; score = 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 4 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 2; surface = carpet (i)

Interpretation
- Within this dataset, there are carpet matches recorded, but none against Roger Federer. The only Federer entry is on clay (Gstaad 2003), not carpet.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the request as: identify any tournament(s) where the recorded opponent was Roger Federer and the surface was carpet. I used case-insensitive substring matching (ILIKE '%federer%' and ILIKE '%carpet%') to account for formatting variations. All conclusions are limited to the TabFact public.ji_nov_k table, which is the only available source here.
