Claim to verify: “Alabama be the opponent when the attendance be 81079.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text)

Evidence collected
1) Check for any game with normalized attendance = 81,079
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE regexp_replace(coalesce(attendance,''), '[, ]', '', 'g') = '81079';
Result: No rows returned.

Confirmation count:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE regexp_replace(coalesce(attendance,''), '[, ]', '', 'g') = '81079';
Result: match_count = 0

2) Check all games against Alabama and their attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Alabama%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: october 17
  opponent: alabama
  site: legion field birmingham , al
  result: l22 - 23
  attendance: 80079

Assessment
- There is no game in this dataset with attendance exactly 81,079.
- The only Alabama game in the dataset lists attendance 80,079, not 81,079.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the available data in this source.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (East Carolina Pirates football, 1990–1999). If the claim refers to a different team/season/database, it is outside the accessible data and cannot be verified here.
