Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.
- Inspected schema and found a relevant table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders, which includes a text column named "highest rank".
- Tested the claim by counting total rows, distinct values in "highest rank", and the distribution per value.

Data source discovery
- Verified accessible data source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) reachable via the postgres_tabfact34 tool.

Schema details
- Table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), "highest rank" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total rows in the table
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
Result: total_rows = 12

2) Number of distinct values in the "highest rank" column
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "highest rank") AS distinct_highest_rank_count FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
Result: distinct_highest_rank_count = 2

3) Counts per distinct "highest rank" value
SQL executed:
SELECT "highest rank", COUNT(*) AS count_per_rank
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY "highest rank"
ORDER BY count_per_rank DESC, "highest rank" ASC;
Result rows:
- highest rank = ōzeki, count_per_rank = 6
- highest rank = sekiwake, count_per_rank = 6

Conclusion
- The table contains exactly two distinct values in the "highest rank" column. Therefore, the claim that there are only 2 "highest rank" entries (interpreted as distinct categories/values) in the table is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s phrase "there be only 2 highest rank list in the table" as: "There are only two distinct values present in the 'highest rank' column of the table public.list_of_sumo_record_holders."
