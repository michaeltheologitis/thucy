Claim interpreted: “A clay surface [was] used at the tournament on October 10, 2004.” We verify this against the available data.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL instance: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: public.ji_nov_k with columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Step 1 — Locate the row for October 10, 2004:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface
FROM ji_nov_k
WHERE date ~* '(10[^0-9]+10[^0-9]+2004|2004[^0-9]+10[^0-9]+10|10[^0-9]+Oct[^0-9]+2004|Oct[^0-9]+10[^0-9]+2004|October[^0-9]+10[^0-9]+2004|10[^0-9]+October[^0-9]+2004)';
Result:
- date: october 10 , 2004
- tournament: tokyo , japan
- surface: hard

Step 2 — Confirm the exact row for the date text and its surface:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE date = 'october 10 , 2004';
Result:
- date: october 10 , 2004
- tournament: tokyo , japan
- surface: hard

Step 3 — Check if any row on that date has surface = 'clay':
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS clay_count FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE date = 'october 10 , 2004' AND lower(surface) = 'clay';
Result:
- clay_count: 0

Conclusion:
- The only row on October 10, 2004 shows the tournament as “tokyo , japan” with surface “hard,” not “clay.” Therefore, the claim that a clay surface was used on that date is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the tournament recorded in this dataset on the date “october 10 , 2004.”
- Dates are stored as free-form text; exact match was used once the specific string was identified.
- There is only one relevant entry for that date in the available table.
