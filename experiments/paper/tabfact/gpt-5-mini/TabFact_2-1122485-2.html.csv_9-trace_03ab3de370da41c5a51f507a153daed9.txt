Claim interpreted: “There exists at least one driver who completed more than 75 laps but had car trouble (i.e., a retirement reason) and thus no finishing time listed.”

Conclusion: No such drivers exist in the available dataset for the 1971 South African Grand Prix. Every driver with more than 75 laps has a time or gap recorded; none show a retirement reason.

Evidence from data
1) Full table review to understand the fields and values
Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix ORDER BY laps DESC;
Key results (top rows):
- mario andretti — laps: 79 — time / retired: 1:47:35.5
- jackie stewart — laps: 79 — time / retired: + 20.9
- clay regazzoni — laps: 79 — time / retired: + 31.4
- reine wisell — laps: 79 — time / retired: + 1:09.4
- chris amon — laps: 78 — time / retired: + 1 lap
- denny hulme — laps: 78 — time / retired: + 1 lap
- brian redman — laps: 78 — time / retired: + 1 lap
- jacky ickx — laps: 78 — time / retired: + 1 lap
- graham hill — laps: 77 — time / retired: + 2 laps
- ronnie peterson — laps: 77 — time / retired: + 2 laps
- henri pescarolo — laps: 77 — time / retired: + 2 laps
- rolf stommelen — laps: 77 — time / retired: + 2 laps
- andrea de adamich — laps: 75 — time / retired: + 4 laps
(Retirements with explicit reasons appear only for drivers with substantially fewer laps.)

2) Direct list of drivers with laps > 75
Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps > 75;
Results:
- mario andretti — 1:47:35.5
- jackie stewart — + 20.9
- clay regazzoni — + 31.4
- reine wisell — + 1:09.4
- chris amon — + 1 lap
- denny hulme — + 1 lap
- brian redman — + 1 lap
- jacky ickx — + 1 lap
- graham hill — + 2 laps
- ronnie peterson — + 2 laps
- henri pescarolo — + 2 laps
- rolf stommelen — + 2 laps
(All are times/gaps; none are retirement reasons.)

3) Targeted check for “car trouble/no time” among laps > 75
Executed SQL (returned zero rows):
SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired"
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE laps > 75
  AND "time / retired" IS NOT NULL
  AND NOT (
    "time / retired" ~ '^\+' OR
    "time / retired" LIKE '%:%' OR
    lower("time / retired") LIKE '%lap%'
  )
ORDER BY driver;
Interpretation: This filters out entries that clearly show a recorded time or gap (+gap, colon time format, or “lap(s)” wording). No rows remained, confirming no driver above 75 laps has a retirement reason instead of a time/gap.

Answer: The list is empty—there are no drivers with more than 75 laps who had car trouble and therefore no recorded time.

Assumptions
- “care trouble” interpreted as “car trouble,” i.e., retirement due to a mechanical/incident reason.
- “no time” interpreted as the absence of a finishing time/gap, meaning the “time / retired” field contains a retirement reason (e.g., engine, gearbox) rather than a time or +gap.
- Scope restricted to the available dataset: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (1971 South African Grand Prix).
