- Executed SQL:

  - player: dan o 'sullivan
  - nationality: united states
  - position: center
  - years for jazz: 1990 - 91
  - school / club team: fordham

Analysis
- The data shows that Dan O’Sullivan is listed on the Utah Jazz all-time roster as a center, with tenure “1990–91,” and his school/club team as “Fordham.”
- The phrase “Fordham Jazz Club” is not accurate as an entity: Fordham refers to the university he attended (college/“school”), while “Jazz” refers to the NBA team Utah Jazz for which he played. There is no indication of a team called “Fordham Jazz Club.”
- Therefore, the accurate statement supported by the data is: Dan O’Sullivan (Fordham alumnus) played center for the Utah Jazz in 1990–91.

Conclusion
- True components: Dan O’Sullivan played center; he is associated with Fordham; he played for the Utah Jazz (1990–91).
- Inaccurate component: Combining these into “Fordham Jazz Club” is incorrect.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing as a conflation of Fordham (college) and Utah Jazz (NBA team). No data in the accessible source suggests an entity named “Fordham Jazz Club.”
