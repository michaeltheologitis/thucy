Claim interpreted: The user asserts that when the team’s record was 4 - 5, the opponent was the Yankees on April 11.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Table: public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record)

Evidence collected
1) Understand the format of the record column
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT record FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY record;
- Result (excerpt): includes "4 - 5" among the distinct values, confirming the format is "W - L" with spaces around the dash.

2) Find the game(s) where the record was exactly 4 - 5
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE record = '4 - 5';
- Result:
  date: april 12, opponent: yankees
- Interpretation: The record reached 4 - 5 on April 12 vs. the Yankees.

3) Verify what happened on April 11 and April 12
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, record
  FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%Apr%' OR date ILIKE '%April%'
  ORDER BY date;
- Relevant returned rows:
  - april 11 — opponent: yankees — score: 11 - 6 (10) — record: 4 - 4
  - april 12 — opponent: yankees — score: 5 - 3 — record: 4 - 5
- Interpretation: On April 11 the record was 4 - 4 (after the game) vs Yankees; on April 12 it became 4 - 5 vs Yankees.

Conclusion
- The opponent part (Yankees) is correct, but the date is off by one day. The record of 4 - 5 occurred on April 12, not April 11.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1989 Toronto Blue Jays season (the only available connected dataset).
