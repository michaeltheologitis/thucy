Claim interpreted: “Pride be the away team with a result of W 11 - 10 for the game held on June 18.”

What I checked and found:
- Data source discovery: I found one accessible database (postgres_tabfact30) with a relevant table for game results.
- Relevant table and schema:
  - public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
    - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), home / away (text), field (text), result (text)

Evidence from the data:
1) Full table scan to understand entries
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT date, opponent, "home / away", field, result FROM t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season;
   - Relevant returned row (among 12 total):
     date: june 18 | opponent: pride | home / away: away | field: alumni stadium (kean university) | result: w 11 - 10

2) Targeted lookup for June 18 vs. Pride
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT date, opponent, "home / away", field, result
     FROM t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
     WHERE date ILIKE '%June 18%'
       AND opponent ILIKE '%Pride%';
   - Result:
     date: june 18; opponent: pride; home / away: away; field: alumni stadium (kean university); result: w 11 - 10

Assessment of the claim against the evidence:
- “Pride be the away team” — Not supported. The “home / away” column is from the Philadelphia Barrage perspective; it shows the Barrage were away on June 18, meaning Pride were the home team.
- “with a result of W 11 - 10” — The result recorded for that game is indeed “W 11 - 10,” but this “W” is for the Barrage (the table’s subject team). Pride’s outcome would have been a 10–11 loss.

Conclusion:
- The date and scoreline match an actual game on June 18, but the statement that Pride were the away team (and implicitly that they had the “W”) is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Pride” refers to the opponent listed as “pride” in the t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season table.
- “The game held on June 18” refers to the June 18 entry in that table.
- “Home / away” denotes the Philadelphia Barrage’s status, so the opponent’s status is the inverse.
- The “result” field records the Barrage’s result, not the opponent’s.
