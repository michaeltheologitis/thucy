- Data environment explored and verified one available table of Bradford City’s 2008–09 season fixtures/results.

Data source discovery
- Found PostgreSQL database postgres_tabfact17 with public schema containing table: t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (columns: game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance).

Evidence from the data

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Port Vale';
- Result:
  match_count = 2

2) List of matching fixtures
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Port Vale' ORDER BY game;
- Returned rows:
  - game: 5, date: 6 september 2008, opponent: port vale, venue: away, result: 2 - 0
  - game: 39, date: 21 march 2009, opponent: port vale, venue: home, result: 0 - 1

Conclusion
- The data shows Bradford City played Port Vale exactly 2 times in the 2008–09 season. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “According to the chart” is interpreted as the available 2008–09 Bradford City season table (fixtures/results) in the database.
- Opponent matching was done case-insensitively (ILIKE) to account for lowercase storage of team names.
