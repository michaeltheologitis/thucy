Claim interpreted: “Paul Findley (Illinois 20th district) was first elected after Henry Hyde (Illinois 6th district).”

Data source: TabFact (public schema), table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980. Relevant columns: district (text), incumbent (text), first elected (bigint).

Findings grounded in data:
- Paul Findley is listed as the incumbent for “illinois 20” with first elected year 1960.
- Henry Hyde is listed as the incumbent for “illinois 6” with first elected year 1974.
- Therefore, Paul Findley was first elected before Henry Hyde (1960 vs. 1974), not after.

Executed SQL and results (exact):
1) List Illinois rows to locate entries
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 WHERE district ILIKE '%Illinois%';
Result:
[{"district":"illinois 2","first elected":1970,"incumbent":"morgan f murphy"},{"district":"illinois 6","first elected":1974,"incumbent":"henry hyde"},{"district":"illinois 7","first elected":1973,"incumbent":"cardiss collins"},{"district":"illinois 12","first elected":1969,"incumbent":"phil crane"},{"district":"illinois 13","first elected":1962,"incumbent":"robert mcclory"},{"district":"illinois 15","first elected":1976,"incumbent":"tom corcoran"},{"district":"illinois 19","first elected":1966,"incumbent":"tom railsback"},{"district":"illinois 20","first elected":1960,"incumbent":"paul findley"}]

2) Directly retrieve the two incumbents
SQL:
SELECT incumbent, district, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 WHERE incumbent IN ('paul findley','henry hyde','Paul Findley','Henry Hyde');
Result:
[{"district":"illinois 6","first elected":1974,"incumbent":"henry hyde"},{"district":"illinois 20","first elected":1960,"incumbent":"paul findley"}]

Conclusion: The district details are correct (Findley—Illinois 20; Hyde—Illinois 6), but the temporal claim is not: Findley was first elected in 1960, which is before Hyde’s 1974.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “be first elect after” as “was first elected after.”
- Used the “first elected” year in the 1980 House elections table as authoritative for each incumbent’s initial election year.
