Claim to verify: “melbourne have the second lowest score when playing as the away team.”

What I checked
- Dataset available: public.t_1972_vfl_season (1972 VFL matches; contains home/away teams and scores as text like G.B (TotalPoints)).
- Interpreted “score” as the total points in parentheses within the score text.
- Ranked all away teams in this table by their away total points to see Melbourne’s position.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Extract away total points and order from lowest to highest:
SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)')::int AS points
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
ORDER BY points ASC, "away team" ASC;

Result (away team — away score — points):
- melbourne — 8.10 (58) — 58
- south melbourne — 8.15 (63) — 63
- st kilda — 9.11 (65) — 65
- north melbourne — 9.12 (66) — 66
- geelong — 15.8 (98) — 98
- richmond — 17.9 (111) — 111

2) Compute rank and show Melbourne’s row:
SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT
    *,
    CAST(substring("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS away_points,
    RANK() OVER (ORDER BY CAST(substring("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) ASC) AS away_points_rank
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT "date","home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","crowd", away_points, away_points_rank
FROM ranked
WHERE LOWER("away team") = 'melbourne'
ORDER BY "date";

Result:
- date: 15 july 1972 | home team: collingwood | away team: melbourne | away score: 8.10 (58) | away_points: 58 | away_points_rank: 1 (lowest)

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset, Melbourne’s away score is the lowest, not the second lowest. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible table public.t_1972_vfl_season (6 matches on 15 July 1972).
- “Score” means total points in parentheses from the score string.
- “melbourne” refers to the team named exactly “melbourne,” not “north melbourne” or “south melbourne.”
