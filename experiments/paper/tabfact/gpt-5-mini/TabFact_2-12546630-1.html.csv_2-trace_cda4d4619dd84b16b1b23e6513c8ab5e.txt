Claim to verify: In the 1933 Giro d'Italia, Gérard Loncke won the race on May 26, despite Alfredo Binda being the race leader.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact, schema: public) containing a relevant table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia with columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text).

Evidence 1: Retrieve the May 26 entry
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE date ILIKE '%May 26%' OR date ILIKE '%26 May%' OR date ILIKE '%May 26, 1933%' OR date ILIKE '%26 May 1933%' OR date ILIKE '%26/5/1933%' OR date ILIKE '%26/5%' OR date ILIKE '%26-%May%' OR date ILIKE '%26-may%';
- Result:
  - date: 26 may
  - course: bassano del grappa to bolzano
  - winner: gerard loncke ( bel )
  - race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )

Evidence 2: Cross-check all Gérard Loncke stage wins in 1933 Giro
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE winner ILIKE '%Loncke%';
- Results:
  1) date: 14 may | course: rome to naples | winner: gerard loncke ( bel ) | race leader: jef demuysere ( bel )
  2) date: 26 may | course: bassano del grappa to bolzano | winner: gerard loncke ( bel ) | race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )

Assessment:
- The table explicitly shows that on 26 May (listed as "26 may"), Gérard Loncke won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano while the overall race leader was Alfredo Binda. This directly supports the claim as a stage result on that date.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data: Gérard Loncke won on May 26, 1933, and Alfredo Binda was the race leader at that time.

Assumptions clarified:
- "Win the race on May 26" is interpreted as winning the stage held on May 26 (a single-day stage), not the overall general classification of the Giro. The data confirms the stage winner and concurrent race leader for that day.
