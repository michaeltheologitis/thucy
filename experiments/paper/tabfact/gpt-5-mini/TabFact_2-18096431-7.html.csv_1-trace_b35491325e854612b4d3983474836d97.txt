Claim interpreted: In the 1996 PGA Championship table, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are tied for the lowest to-par score.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1996_pga_championship(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text, money bigint)

Method
1) Compute the minimum numeric to-par value (treat 'E' as 0; strip spaces and '+' before casting).
2) List all players whose normalized to-par equals that minimum.

Evidence
1) Minimum to-par value
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN((CASE WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') = 'E' THEN '0' WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+$' THEN replace(replace(trim("to par"),' ', ''), '+', '') ELSE NULL END)::integer) AS min_topar FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship;
Result: min_topar = -11

2) Players at the minimum to-par
SQL executed:
SELECT place, player, "to par" AS original_to_par, (CASE WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') = 'E' THEN '0' WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+$' THEN replace(replace(trim("to par"),' ', ''), '+', '') ELSE NULL END)::integer AS normalized_to_par FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE (CASE WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') = 'E' THEN '0' WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+$' THEN replace(replace(trim("to par"),' ', ''), '+', '') ELSE NULL END)::integer = -11 ORDER BY player;
Returned rows:
- place: 1, player: mark brooks, original_to_par: "- 11", normalized_to_par: -11
- place: 2, player: kenny perry, original_to_par: "- 11", normalized_to_par: -11

Conclusion
- The data shows the lowest to-par in this event is -11, and both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry have -11. This supports that they tie for the lowest to-par in the 1996 PGA Championship table.
- Note: The table records places as 1 (Brooks) and 2 (Perry), consistent with a playoff deciding the winner, but their to-par values are equal.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1996 PGA Championship dataset found in the connected database.
- Interpreted "to par" as a numeric value after normalizing text (handling 'E' as 0 and removing spaces/plus signs).
- Interpreted the misspelling "mark brook" as Mark Brooks.
