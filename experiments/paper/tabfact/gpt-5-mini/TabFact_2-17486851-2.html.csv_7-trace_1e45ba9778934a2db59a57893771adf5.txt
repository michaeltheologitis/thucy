Summary of available data sources
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4), public schema.
- Available table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season with columns [nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee, source]. No other tables were found.

Evidence gathered
1) Search for any entries mentioning Paphos/Pafos
Executed SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
WHERE nat ILIKE '%paphos%' OR nat ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR name ILIKE '%paphos%' OR name ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR "moving to" ILIKE '%paphos%' OR "moving to" ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR type ILIKE '%paphos%' OR type ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR "transfer window" ILIKE '%paphos%' OR "transfer window" ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%paphos%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%pafos%'
   OR source ILIKE '%paphos%' OR source ILIKE '%pafos%';
Result:
- nat: mkd | name: nikolovski | moving to: aep paphos | type: mutual consent | transfer window: winter | transfer fee: free | source: -

2) Check whether the same row has nat = 'mkd'
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, nat, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE lower(nat) = 'mkd';
Result:
- name: nikolovski | nat: mkd | moving to: aep paphos | type: mutual consent | transfer window: winter | transfer fee: free

Assessment of the claim
- "Paphos": Supported. The player’s destination is explicitly “aep paphos”.
- "the player be release": Supported. The move type is “mutual consent” with transfer fee “free”, indicating a release.
- "by mkd": Partially or not supported depending on interpretation. In the data, "mkd" appears only in the nat (nationality) column for this player, which denotes nationality (commonly the code for Macedonia/North Macedonia). There is no evidence that "mkd" refers to a club (e.g., MK Dons) or the releasing entity in this dataset. The table does not include a "from" club field; it documents players (from APOEL’s 2008–09 season context) and their moves, not releases by an entity labeled "mkd".

Conclusion
- The data confirms that a player (nikolovski) with nat = mkd was released (mutual consent, free) and moved to AEP Paphos. If the claim means “a Macedonian (mkd) player was released to Paphos,” it is supported. If it means “released by MK Dons,” this database provides no support for that interpretation.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “mkd” as the nationality code (as it appears under the nat column), not as a club name.
- Interpreted “released” to include “mutual consent” and “free” transfer as a release.
- Treated the single discovered table as the authoritative scope of available evidence, as no other data sources were accessible via the tools.
