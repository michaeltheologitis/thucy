What I checked
- Data source discovery: Found a single accessible table in the TabFact (postgres_tabfact12) database, schema public: all_japan_university_rugby_championship.
- Relevant columns: title, season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue, attendance.

Evidence from the database
1) Locate seasons containing “2000”
SQL executed:
SELECT season, title, winner, "runner - up", attendance
FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season LIKE '%2000%';

Result:
[{"season":"2000 - 1 details","title":"37th","winner":"kanto gakuin university","runner - up":"hosei","attendance":"n / a"}]

2) Confirm the exact row by season value returned above
SQL executed:
SELECT title, season, winner, "runner - up", attendance
FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season = '2000 - 1 details';

Result:
[{"season":"2000 - 1 details","title":"37th","winner":"kanto gakuin university","runner - up":"hosei","attendance":"n / a"}]

Assessment of each part of the claim
- Season “2000 - 1”: The table stores this entry as "2000 - 1 details". This corresponds to the claimed season label.
- Winner “kanto gakuin university”: Matches the winner field exactly.
- Title “37th”: Matches the title field exactly.
- Attendance “not available”: The attendance field is "n / a", which indicates not available.

Conclusion
All elements of the claim are supported by the data in the all_japan_university_rugby_championship table.

Assumptions
- I interpret the user’s “season 2000 - 1” as the record stored in the data as "2000 - 1 details".
- I interpret “attendance be not available” as equivalent to the data value "n / a".
