Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema). Relevant table detected: t_1975_u_s_open_golf with columns [place, player, country, score, to par, money].

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Locate Peter Oosterhuis in the 1975 U.S. Open results table and retrieve placement and prize money.
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money
FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Peter Oosterhuis%';
Result:
- place: t7
  player: peter oosterhuis
  country: england
  score: 69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289
  to par: + 5
  money: 7500

Assessment:
- The table shows Peter Oosterhuis with place = "t7" and money = "7500". This directly supports the claim that his place was T7 and he won 7,500.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the 1975 U.S. Open (as per the table name). 
- "win 7500" refers to prize money in the table’s money column and that "t7" denotes tied for 7th place. 
- Player name matched case-insensitively.
