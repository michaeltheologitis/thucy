Summary conclusion: The data confirms that Peter Oosterhuis finished T7 in the 1975 U.S. Open Golf, but his money is listed as 7500, not 10875. The amount 10875 corresponds to players who finished T3.

What I checked and found:
- Player: peter oosterhuis
  - Place: t7
  - Money: 7500
- Rows with money equal to 10875 belong to players who finished T3 (Frank Beard, Ben Crenshaw, Hale Irwin, Bob Murphy), not Peter Oosterhuis.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) Locate Peter Oosterhuis and verify place and money
SQL:
SELECT place, money, player FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Oosterhuis%';
Result:
- player: peter oosterhuis | place: t7 | money: 7500

2) Full row for Peter Oosterhuis for additional context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Oosterhuis%';
Result:
- place: t7 | player: peter oosterhuis | country: england | score: 69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289 | to par: + 5 | money: 7500

3) Check who has money = 10875
SQL:
SELECT *, regexp_replace(money, '\\D', '', 'g') AS digits_only
FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf
WHERE money = '10875'
   OR money LIKE '%10875%'
   OR regexp_replace(money, '\\D', '', 'g') = '10875'
   OR regexp_replace(money, '\\D', '', 'g') LIKE '%10875%';
Results (place | player | money):
- t3 | frank beard | 10875
- t3 | ben crenshaw | 10875
- t3 | hale irwin | 10875
- t3 | bob murphy | 10875

Data source discovery context:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1975_u_s_open_golf
- Columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money (all text)

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1975 U.S. Open Golf results (the only available golf dataset discovered).
- The phrase “who have 10875” refers to the prize money in the money column for that event.
