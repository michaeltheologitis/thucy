Claim to verify: “the year 1972 - 1976 have a rank of 1.”

Summary conclusion: Verified. In the accessible dataset, the row with years = '1972 - 1976' has rank = 1.

Data discovery and schema understanding
- Located the relevant table in the public schema.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  ORDER BY table_name;
  Result: my_info_table

- Inspected columns to confirm the presence and types of year-like and rank-like fields.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
    AND table_name = 'my_info_table'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  Key columns for this verification:
  - years (text) — stores year ranges like '1972 - 1976'
  - rank (bigint)

- Quick sample of table contents showing the relevant row is present in the first 10:
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 10;
  Relevant returned row among the first 10:
  { "player": "jim nowers", "years": "1972 - 1976", "rank": 1, "games": 112, "reb avg": 9.4, "total rebounds": 1048 }

Direct verification of the claim
- Queried the exact years range to retrieve its rank.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, years, rank, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE years = '1972 - 1976';
  Result:
  player: jim nowers
  years: 1972 - 1976
  rank: 1
  games: 112
  reb avg: 9.4
  total rebounds: 1048

Conclusion
- The data explicitly shows that the entry with years = '1972 - 1976' has rank = 1. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the 'years' range recorded in public.my_info_table and asks whether that specific range ('1972 - 1976') is associated with rank 1 in this dataset.
