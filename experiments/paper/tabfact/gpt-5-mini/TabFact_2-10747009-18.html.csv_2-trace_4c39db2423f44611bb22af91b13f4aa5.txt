Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL TabFact database (public schema). It contains one relevant table: public.t_1927_vfl_season, which appears to record matches from the 1927 VFL season with columns: home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, date.

What I checked
- Whether any match in this dataset where Carlton played St Kilda had Carlton listed as the away team.

Executed queries and evidence
1) Confirm table has data
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season;
Result: [{"count":6}]

2) Exact-case head-to-head check (returned zero due to case/style)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'Carlton' AND "away team" = 'St Kilda')
   OR ("home team" = 'St Kilda' AND "away team" = 'Carlton');
Result: [{"count":0}]

3) Case-insensitive search for any rows involving Carlton or St Kilda
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Carlton%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Carlton%'
   OR "home team" ILIKE '%St Kilda%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%St Kilda%';
Result: [{"count":1}]

4) Retrieve those head-to-head rows
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, "home team score", "away team score"
FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Carlton%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Carlton%'
   OR "home team" ILIKE '%St Kilda%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%St Kilda%'
ORDER BY date;
Result: [{"date":"10 september 1927","home team":"carlton","away team":"st kilda","venue":"princes park","home team score":"15.16 (106)","away team score":"7.9 (51)"}]

Findings
- In the only Carlton vs St Kilda match present in this dataset (10 September 1927), Carlton is the home team and St Kilda is the away team.
- No matches in this table have Carlton as the away team versus St Kilda.

Conclusion
- The claim that Carlton are the away team when they play St Kilda is not supported by the available data; the recorded head-to-head match shows the opposite.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (t_1927_vfl_season). Team names are stored in lowercase; case-insensitive matching was used. The dataset may represent a subset (e.g., finals) of the 1927 season, but it is treated as complete within its scope per the data grounding instructions.
