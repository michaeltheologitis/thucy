Claim to verify: “In all elections where the Democrat held the seat, the party maintained the office.”

How I interpreted the claim (brief): For the elections represented in the accessible dataset, check whether, in every case where the Democratic Party held the seat prior to the election, the Democrats maintained control (i.e., the incumbent Democratic party was re-elected and did not lose the seat).

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL instance with a single accessible table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  - Appears to contain entries for 1942 U.S. House elections; sample rows indicate California districts.

Schema inspection:
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (text), result (text), candidates (text)
  - No keys/constraints. “result” appears to encode outcomes; “party” appears to encode the incumbent’s party.

Evidence collected from the data
1) Example rows and distinct values to understand party/outcome encoding
- SQL (example rows):
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  LIMIT 10;
  Returned (7 rows; examples): Democratic rows show result = "re - elected"; one row shows a “new seat republican gain” with party="none (district created)".

- SQL (distinct party values):
  SELECT DISTINCT party
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  ORDER BY party;
  Returned: democratic; none (district created); republican

- SQL (distinct result values):
  SELECT DISTINCT result
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  ORDER BY result;
  Returned: new seat republican gain; re - elected

Interpretation from step 1: The table encodes holds via “re - elected”. Gains are explicitly labeled (e.g., “new seat republican gain”). There is no explicit “Democratic hold” string; instead re-election indicates the incumbent party maintained the seat.

2) Quantify whether Democratic-held seats were maintained
- SQL (total rows):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942;
  Result: 7

- SQL (count of Democratic-held seats):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS democratic_count
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE lower(trim(party)) = 'democratic';
  Result: 3

- SQL (Democratic-held seats with result = 're - elected'):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS re_elected_democrats
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE lower(trim(party)) = 'democratic' AND lower(trim(result)) = 're - elected';
  Result: 3

- SQL (Democratic-held seats with result <> 're - elected'):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS not_re_elected_democrats
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE lower(trim(party)) = 'democratic' AND lower(trim(result)) <> 're - elected';
  Result: 0

- SQL (list Democratic-held rows):
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, result, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE lower(party) = 'democratic';
  Result (3 rows):
  • california 7 — result: re - elected
  • california 10 — result: re - elected
  • california 17 — result: re - elected

Findings:
- In this dataset, all Democratic-held seats (3 out of 3) were re-elected. There are no cases where a Democratic-held seat did not maintain party control.
- The only “gain” case shown is a “new seat republican gain” where the party column is “none (district created)”, which is out of scope for “where the Democrat held the seat.”

Conclusion:
- Within the available dataset (public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942), the claim is supported: in all elections where the Democrat held the seat, the Democrats maintained the office (100% of Democratic-held seats show “re - elected,” zero counterexamples).

Assumptions made (due to scope/ambiguity):
- Scope: I interpreted “all election” to mean all elections represented in the accessible dataset (this table), not every election historically.
- Semantics: “party” is the incumbent’s party (i.e., the party that held the seat prior to the election). “Maintain the office” corresponds to result = “re - elected,” indicating the incumbent party kept the seat.
- Case/whitespace-insensitive comparisons were used for robustness.
