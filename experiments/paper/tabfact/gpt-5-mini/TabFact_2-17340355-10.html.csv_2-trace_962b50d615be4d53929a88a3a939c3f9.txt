Claim to verify: “the game at the target center take place after the game at the fedexforum.”

Data sources explored
- Available database discovered: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (columns: game, date, team, "location attendance", record). This table lists late-season games, venues, and (usually) attendance.

Method
- Identify rows whose venue mentions “target center” or “fedexforum”.
- Parse the date text into month/day numbers and order chronologically.
- Count occurrences to confirm there is exactly one game at each of those venues in this dataset.

Evidence
1) Chronological ordering of the two relevant games
SQL executed:
"SELECT date, \"location attendance\" AS location_attendance,
       split_part(date, ' ', 1) AS month,
       NULLIF(split_part(date, ' ', 2), '')::int AS day,
       CASE lower(split_part(date,' ',1))
         WHEN 'october' THEN 10 WHEN 'november' THEN 11 WHEN 'december' THEN 12
         WHEN 'january' THEN 1 WHEN 'february' THEN 2 WHEN 'march' THEN 3
         WHEN 'april' THEN 4 WHEN 'may' THEN 5 WHEN 'june' THEN 6
         WHEN 'july' THEN 7 WHEN 'august' THEN 8 WHEN 'september' THEN 9
       END AS month_num
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE lower(\"location attendance\") LIKE '%target center%' OR lower(\"location attendance\") LIKE '%fedexforum%'
ORDER BY month_num, day;"
Results:
- april 10 — fedexforum 15908 (month_num=4, day=10)
- april 11 — target center 18478 (month_num=4, day=11)
Interpretation: The Target Center game (April 11) occurs after the FedExForum game (April 10).

2) Uniqueness check (counts of rows per venue)
SQL executed:
"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE \"location attendance\" ILIKE '%target center%';"
Result: 1

SQL executed:
"SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE \"location attendance\" ILIKE '%fedexforum%';"
Result: 1
Interpretation: There is exactly one game at each of these venues in this dataset, so the ordering above is unambiguous.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the game at FedExForum on April 10 and the game at Target Center on April 11. Therefore, the game at the Target Center took place after the game at the FedExForum.

Assumptions
- This verification is scoped to the available table (t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season). Dates are stored as text without year; I treated them as occurring within the same season and ordered by month then day. No time-of-day information is present, so “after” is interpreted by calendar date.
