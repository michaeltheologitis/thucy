Claim assessed: “when the indianapolis colt be the visit team at giant stadium , the final score be 26 - 21.”

Data source discovery:
- Explored connected databases and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present (columns: date, visiting team, final score, host team, stadium).

Evidence from data:
1) Query to find games at Giants Stadium with the Indianapolis Colts as the visiting team
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", "final score", stadium
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "visiting team" ILIKE 'indianapolis colts' AND stadium ILIKE 'giants stadium'
ORDER BY date;
- Result:
[{"date":"september 10","visiting team":"indianapolis colts","host team":"new york giants","final score":"26 - 21","stadium":"giants stadium"}]
- Interpretation: This shows a Sunday Night Football game at Giants Stadium where the Indianapolis Colts were the visiting team and the final score was 26 - 21.

2) Auxiliary check (scope of Colts as visiting team entries)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS colts_like
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE "visiting team" ILIKE '%Colts%';
- Result:
[{"colts_like":2}]
- Interpretation: Confirms the table contains multiple Colts visiting entries overall, but only one at Giants Stadium matched in the primary query above.

Conclusion:
- The data directly supports the claim: there is a recorded Sunday Night Football game at Giants Stadium with the Indianapolis Colts as the visiting team where the final score was 26 - 21 (against the New York Giants).

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The available dataset covers NBC Sunday Night Football results from 2006 to present. The match found corresponds to that scope (commonly known as the 2006 season opener: Colts at Giants, 26-21, at Giants Stadium). The claim appears to reference this specific instance, and within the available authoritative data, it is verified.
