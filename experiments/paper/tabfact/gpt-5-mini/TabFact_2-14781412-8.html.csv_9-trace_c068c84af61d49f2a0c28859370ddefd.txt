Summary conclusion
- Within the available data, South Korea hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than once (1986 in Seoul and 2002 in Busan). However, Seoul itself appears only once. Also, no other location appears more than once, so only South Korea (via two different cities) appears multiple times in this dataset.

Evidence from the TabFact database
1) Full list of editions (years and locations)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1982 — new delhi
- 1986 — seoul
- 1994 — hiroshima
- 1998 — bangkok
- 2002 — busan
- 2006 — doha
- 2010 — guangzhou

Interpretation: Seoul (South Korea) appears in 1986 and Busan (South Korea) appears in 2002. Other locations appear once each.

2) Count of occurrences by location (to test whether any city hosted more than once)
SQL executed:
SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY cnt DESC, location;
Results (location — count):
- bangkok — 1
- busan — 1
- doha — 1
- guangzhou — 1
- hiroshima — 1
- new delhi — 1
- seoul — 1

Interpretation: No city hosted more than once in this dataset; specifically, Seoul appears only once.

3) Direct check for South Korean locations (Seoul and Busan)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE location IN ('seoul','busan') ORDER BY location, year;
Results:
- busan: 2002
- seoul: 1986

4) Count of South Korean entries (Seoul or Busan)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE lower(location) IN ('seoul','busan');
Result:
- count = 2

Findings vs the claim
- “South Korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the Asian Games more than 1 time”: Supported by this dataset. South Korea appears twice (Seoul 1986, Busan 2002). All other listed locations appear once.
- “in seoul 2 time”: Not supported. Seoul appears only once (1986) in the data.

Assumptions and scope
- I interpret “host equestrian at the Asian Games” as the host city for the Asian Games editions listed in the table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games.
- Country attribution is inferred from city names: Seoul and Busan (South Korea), New Delhi (India), Hiroshima (Japan), Bangkok (Thailand), Doha (Qatar), Guangzhou (China).
- The analysis is strictly based on the accessible TabFact dataset (years 1982–2010 as listed).
