Claim to verify: “2 viral family have a helical virion shape.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing one relevant table: public.viral_disease.
- Schema details (relevant columns):
  - family (text)
  - virion shape (text)

Evidence gathered (with executed SQL)
1) Count of distinct families with helical virion shape
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS distinct_family_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';
- Result: distinct_family_count = 7

2) List of distinct families with helical virion shape
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "family"
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%'
  ORDER BY "family";
- Result (families):
  - arenaviridae
  - bunyaviridae
  - coronaviridae
  - filoviridae
  - orthomyxoviridae
  - paramyxoviridae
  - rhabdoviridae

3) Context: distribution of virion shape values in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  GROUP BY "virion shape"
  ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC, "virion shape";
- Result (virion shape : count):
  - icosahedral : 13
  - helical : 6
  - complex : 2
  - helical , bullet shaped : 1
  - spherical : 1

Findings
- The data show 7 distinct viral families with helical virion shape, not 2.
- The families identified are: arenaviridae, bunyaviridae, coronaviridae, filoviridae, orthomyxoviridae, paramyxoviridae, and rhabdoviridae.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. More than two viral families in the dataset have helical virion morphology.

Assumptions
- “Viral family” corresponds to the “family” column in public.viral_disease.
- “Helical virion shape” is identified via a case-insensitive substring match on the word “helical” within the “virion shape” column (thus including entries like “helical , bullet shaped”).
- The TabFact public.viral_disease table is treated as authoritative for this verification task.
