Claim to verify: A 2-round match held in South Dakota, United States, with the opponent named Brian Dunn.

Data source exploration:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: brad_gumm
- Table columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), location (text)

Evidence from data (SQL and results):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.brad_gumm WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Brian Dunn%' AND location ILIKE '%South Dakota%';
- Result (res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location):
  - win | 5 - 1 - 1 | brian dunn | submission (rear naked choke) | msf - total destruction | 2 | south dakota , united states

Assessment:
- Opponent named Brian Dunn: Supported (opponent = "brian dunn").
- Location in South Dakota, United States: Supported (location = "south dakota , united states").
- “2 round match”: The fight’s round value is 2, indicating it ended in round 2. This supports the notion of a “2-round” outcome; the data does not specify scheduled rounds, only the finishing round.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the fight record in the brad_gumm table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “2 round match” to mean the bout ended in round 2 (as recorded in the round field), not that it was scheduled for exactly two rounds.
