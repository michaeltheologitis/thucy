Claim to verify: "there be 4 episode in region 4 on march 13 , 2008"

1) Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database via the postgres_tabfact0 connector (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.my_info_table with columns:
  - volume (bigint)
  - discs (bigint)
  - episodes (bigint)
  - region 1 (text)
  - region 2 (text)
  - region 4 (text)

2) Evidence retrieval and checks
- Check A: Exact text "March 13, 2008" with episodes = 4 (case-insensitive on that exact pattern)
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episodes = 4 AND "region 4" ILIKE '%March 13, 2008%';
  Result: match_count = 0
  Interpretation: No row contains the exact string "March 13, 2008" (with no extra spaces) alongside episodes = 4.

- Check B: Broader scan for 2008 when episodes = 4 to locate candidate rows
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episodes = 4 AND "region 4" LIKE '%2008%';
  Results:
  - volume: 3, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 4: march 13 , 2008
  - volume: 4, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 4: june 19 , 2008
  Interpretation: There is a row with episodes = 4 and region 4 showing the date string "march 13 , 2008" (lowercase with spaces around the comma), and another row for June 19, 2008.

- Check C: Direct match for the exact formatting observed in the data (case-insensitive)
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("region 4") LIKE '%march 13 , 2008%';
  Result:
  - volume: 3, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 4: march 13 , 2008
  Interpretation: The table contains a row where the region 4 release date is "march 13 , 2008" and the episodes count is 4.

3) Conclusion
- The data shows a Region 4 entry dated "march 13 , 2008" with episodes = 4. Therefore, the claim is supported by the database.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "region 4" as the "region 4" column in public.my_info_table and "4 episode" as the numeric episodes column equaling 4.
- Interpreted the date as a textual date embedded in the "region 4" field; matching was done case-insensitively and tolerant of the observed extra spaces around the comma in the stored text.
