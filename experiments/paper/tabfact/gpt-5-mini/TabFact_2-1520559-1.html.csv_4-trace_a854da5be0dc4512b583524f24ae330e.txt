Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single table: women_s_british_open in the TabFact public schema.
- Retrieved the champions and winner's shares for 2011 and 2012 and computed the difference.

Data source and schema
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: women_s_british_open
- Relevant columns: year (bigint), champion (text), winner 's share (bigint)

Evidence
1) Champions and winner's shares for 2011 and 2012
SQL executed:
SELECT year, champion, "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2011, 2012) ORDER BY year;
Results observed:
- 2011: champion = yani tseng; winner's share = 392133
- 2012: champion = jiyai shin; winner's share = 428650

2) Difference between 2012 and 2011 winner's shares
SQL executed:
SELECT
  (SELECT champion FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2011) AS champion_2011,
  (SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2011) AS share_2011,
  (SELECT champion FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2012) AS champion_2012,
  (SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2012) AS share_2012,
  ((SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2012) - (SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2011)) AS difference;
Result observed:
- share_2011 = 392133; share_2012 = 428650; difference = 36517

Conclusion
- In 2012, Jiyai Shin’s winner's share (428650) is 36517 more than Yani Tseng’s winner's share (392133) in 2011. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “jiyal shin” refers to Jiyai Shin.
- “earn” refers to the “winner's share” column in the women_s_british_open table.
- All amounts are in the same currency as stored in the table; no conversion needed.
