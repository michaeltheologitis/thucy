Claim to verify: “Android 4.2.1 Jelly Bean (November 27, 2012) is the stable version where H.264 is 9.0 and VP9 (WebM) is no.”

What the data shows
- The html5_video table contains an “android browser” row listing the latest stable release and codec support by browser/OS.
- For Android Browser, the latest stable release is “4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )”, H.264 is “3.0”, and VP9 (WebM) is “no”.

Executed SQL evidence
1) Context overview (first rows):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt (row 1):
- browser: android browser
- operating system: android
- latest stable release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )
- theora: 2.3
- h264: 3.0
- vp8 ( webm ): 2.3
- vp9 ( webm ): no

2) Targeted check for Android Browser:
SQL:
SELECT browser, "latest stable release", h264, "vp9 ( webm )" FROM html5_video WHERE browser = 'android browser';
Result:
- browser: android browser
- latest stable release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )
- h264: 3.0
- vp9: no

3) Where does H.264 = 9.0 appear?
SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", theora, h264, "vp8 ( webm )", "vp9 ( webm )" 
FROM html5_video
WHERE h264 = '9.0';
Results:
- internet explorer (windows): h264 9.0; vp9 no
- internet explorer (windows phone): h264 9.0; vp9 no

Assessment of the claim
- “4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 ) be the stable version”: Supported by the data.
- “vp9 (webm) be no”: Supported by the data for Android Browser.
- “h264 be 9.0”: Contradicted by the data; Android Browser shows H.264 = 3.0, not 9.0. The 9.0 value appears for Internet Explorer, not Android Browser.

Conclusion: The claim mixes correct and incorrect details. The version/date and VP9 status are correct; the H.264 value is not.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the “android browser” entry in the html5_video table and its HTML5 video codec support fields (H.264 and VP9).
