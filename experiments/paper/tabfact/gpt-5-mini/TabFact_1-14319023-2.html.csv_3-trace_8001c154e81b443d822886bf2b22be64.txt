Claim to verify:
“In 2007, the girls doubles were Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati, and the mixed doubles were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.”

Data source exploration:
- Accessible data source: a PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with a public schema containing the table “indonesian_national_badminton_championships”. Relevant columns include year, girls doubles, and mixed doubles.

Evidence gathered from the database:
1) Query to retrieve the 2007 champions (girls doubles and mixed doubles):
SQL:
SELECT year, "girls doubles", "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2007;
Result row:
- year: 2007
- girls doubles: “anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati”
- mixed doubles: “wifqi windarto debby susanto”

Assessment:
- The database records for 2007 list the girls doubles champions as “anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati,” matching the claim (names appear in lowercase in the data but match exactly by identity).
- The database records for 2007 list the mixed doubles champions as “wifqi windarto debby susanto,” also matching the claim.

Conclusion:
- The claim is fully supported by the database evidence for the year 2007.

Assumptions made:
- “girl double” refers to the “girls doubles” event and “mixed double” refers to the “mixed doubles” event in the indonesian_national_badminton_championships table.
- Minor differences in capitalization/formatting of names are not material to identity.
