Claim to verify: there be only 1 event in 2011 and it be on 10 - 12 june 2011

Data source exploration:
- Available data sources discovery identified one PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact22 (TabFact), public schema.
- Schema inspection highlighted a relevant table: public.tsuyoshi_fujita with columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint). The date field is stored as text.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all rows for season = '2011'
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank
  FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
  WHERE season = '2011'
  ORDER BY date;
- Result (1 row):
  season: 2011; event type: pro tour; location: nagoya; format: block constructed and booster draft; date: 10 - 12 june 2011; rank: 5

2) Count rows and show distinct dates for season = '2011'
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2011 FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2011';
- Result: count_2011 = 1

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2011' ORDER BY "date";
- Result: ["10 - 12 june 2011"]

Assessment:
- The database contains exactly one row for season 2011 in the relevant table.
- The associated date value for that 2011 event is 10 - 12 june 2011.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the accessible source.

Assumptions:
- I assumed the claim refers to the events recorded in the public.tsuyoshi_fujita table, since it is the only available table with event-like records and a date field in the discovered data source.
- Season is matched exactly as the text '2011'.
