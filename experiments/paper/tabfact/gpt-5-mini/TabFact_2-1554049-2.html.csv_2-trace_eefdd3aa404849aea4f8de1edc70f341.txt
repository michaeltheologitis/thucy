What I checked
- I explored the available database and found a tennis match table (likely for player Jiří Novák) with columns for date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score. I then looked for rows where the opponent is Roger Federer and examined the surface values.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify that an opponent named Federer exists
- Result: roger federer
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Federer%' ORDER BY opponent;

2) Count surfaces for matches where the opponent is Roger Federer
- Result:
  - clay: 1 match
- SQL:
  SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.ji_nov_k
  WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer'
  GROUP BY surface
  ORDER BY match_count DESC;

3) Show the detailed row(s) vs Roger Federer
- Result (date, tournament, surface, score):
  - july 13 , 2003 | gstaad , switzerland | clay | 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 3
- SQL:
  SELECT date, tournament, surface, score
  FROM public.ji_nov_k
  WHERE lower(trim(opponent)) = 'roger federer'
  ORDER BY date;

Conclusion
- In the available dataset, the only match with opponent "roger federer" is on a clay surface. Therefore, the statement that the surface for the opponent Roger Federer is clay is supported by this data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the request as: "For the match(es) in this table where the opponent is Roger Federer, is the surface clay?" The table appears to list matches for Jiří Novák (based on the row content and naming), not all players, so conclusions are scoped to this dataset.
