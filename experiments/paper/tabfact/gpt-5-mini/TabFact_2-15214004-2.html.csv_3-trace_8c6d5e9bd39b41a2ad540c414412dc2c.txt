Claim interpreted: “Peter Lowry’s pick number is 25.” Context assumed: MLS SuperDraft (the available dataset is specifically for the 2008 MLS SuperDraft).

Data source exploration:
- Available relational source discovered: PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with table public.t_2008_mls_superdraft.

Evidence from the database:
1) Identify table columns to locate pick and player fields
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 't_2008_mls_superdraft'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result:
- pick — bigint
- mls team — text
- player — text
- position — text
- affiliation — text

2) Retrieve Peter Lowry’s row to see his pick number
Executed SQL:
SELECT pick, player, "mls team", position, affiliation
FROM public.t_2008_mls_superdraft
WHERE player ILIKE '%Peter Lowry%';
Result:
[ {"pick": 26, "player": "peter lowry", "mls team": "chicago fire", "position": "m / f", "affiliation": "santa clara san jose frogs"} ]

Conclusion based on evidence:
- The table shows Peter Lowry’s pick number as 26 (not 25) in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the MLS SuperDraft (specifically 2008, which is the dataset available).
- Name matching is case-insensitive and exact for “Peter Lowry.”
