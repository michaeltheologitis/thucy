Claim to verify: “footscray score 14.8 when they visit essendon on july 13 1946.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema) with a table t_1946_vfl_season containing VFL 1946 match data.

Schema inspection (summary)
- t_1946_vfl_season columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text). Team names are stored in lowercase.

Evidence and SQL
1) Initial attempt with capitalized team names (returned no rows)
SQL:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","crowd","date"
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'Essendon' AND "away team" = 'Footscray') OR ("home team" = 'Footscray' AND "away team" = 'Essendon')
ORDER BY "date" ASC;
Result: No rows.

2) Identify exact team name strings used in the table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team
FROM (
  SELECT "home team" AS team FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
  UNION
  SELECT "away team" AS team FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
) t
ORDER BY team;
Result (partial): essendon, footscray, … (all lowercase team names).

3) Retrieve Essendon vs Footscray matches
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'essendon' AND "away team" = 'footscray')
   OR ("home team" = 'footscray' AND "away team" = 'essendon')
ORDER BY date ASC;
Result:
- Date: 13 july 1946
- Home team: essendon
- Home score: 16.24 (120)
- Away team: footscray
- Away score: 14.8 (92)
- Venue: windy hill
- Crowd: 29000

Assessment
- The data shows that on 13 July 1946, Footscray played away at Essendon (venue: Windy Hill) and Footscray’s score was 14.8 (92). This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “score 14.8” refers to the goals.behinds notation standard in VFL/AFL (total points 92).
- “visit Essendon” means Essendon was the home team (match at Windy Hill). The date string “13 july 1946” is equivalent to “July 13, 1946.”
