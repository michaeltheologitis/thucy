Claim interpreted: The user is asking whether the Macoto Cobras were the opponent in the game where Horacio Estrada was charged with the loss.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (treated as authoritative per instructions)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, save)

Evidence
1) Find all games where the losing pitcher was Horacio Estrada
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss = 'horacio estrada';
Result:
- date: 3 / 18, opponent: la new bears, score: 4 - 1, loss: horacio estrada

Supporting inspection of loss values
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season ORDER BY loss NULLS LAST;
Result (distinct loss values include):
- horacio estrada (present once among other names)

2) Check whether Macoto Cobras appear as an opponent and who took the loss in those games
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season ORDER BY opponent;
Result (opponents): brother elephants; chinatrust whales; la new bears; macoto cobras

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%macoto cobras%' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: 3 / 31, opponent: macoto cobras, loss: diegomar markwell

Conclusion
- The only game in this dataset where Horacio Estrada was the losing pitcher lists the opponent as La New Bears, not Macoto Cobras. Games against Macoto Cobras in this dataset show a different losing pitcher.

Answer: No. The opponent was La New Bears when Horacio Estrada took the loss (not Macoto Cobras).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2007 Uni-President Lions season data available in the TabFact database.
- Player names in the table are stored in lowercase (e.g., "horacio estrada"), and matching was performed accordingly.
- No other seasons or leagues are available in the connected data source; conclusions are based solely on the accessible dataset.
