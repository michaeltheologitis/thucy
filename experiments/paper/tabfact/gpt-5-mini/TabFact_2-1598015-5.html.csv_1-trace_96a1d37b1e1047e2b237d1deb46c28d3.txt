Claim interpreted: For the PGA Championship (in the available dataset), the following should hold simultaneously: top-25 finishes < 4, wins = 0, cuts made = 6, and top-5 finishes > 0.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Schema: public
- Table: public."chris_dimarco"
- Columns: "tournament" (text), "wins" (bigint), "top - 5" (bigint), "top - 10" (bigint), "top - 25" (bigint), "events" (bigint), "cuts made" (bigint)

Evidence query 1 — retrieve PGA Championship row values:
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public."chris_dimarco" WHERE "tournament" ILIKE '%pga%';
Result (row for "pga championship"):
- tournament: pga championship
- wins: 0
- top - 5: 1
- top - 10: 1
- top - 25: 4
- events: 10
- cuts made: 8

Evidence query 2 — directly test the combined condition:
SQL executed:
SELECT "tournament",
       ("top - 25" < 4) AND ("wins" = 0) AND ("cuts made" = 6) AND ("top - 5" > 0) AS conditions_satisfied,
       "top - 25", "wins", "cuts made", "top - 5"
FROM public."chris_dimarco"
WHERE lower("tournament") = 'pga championship';
Returned values:
- tournament: pga championship
- top - 25: 4
- wins: 0
- cuts made: 8
- top - 5: 1
- conditions_satisfied: false

Condition-by-condition assessment (from Evidence query 2):
- top-25 < 4: Not satisfied (actual = 4)
- wins = 0: Satisfied (actual = 0)
- cuts made = 6: Not satisfied (actual = 8)
- top-5 > 0: Satisfied (actual = 1)

Conclusion: The claim requires all conditions to be true simultaneously. In the available data for "pga championship", two of the four conditions fail (top-25 is not < 4; cuts made is not 6). Therefore, the claim does not hold as stated, though parts of it (wins = 0 and top-5 > 0) are correct.

Assumptions and scope:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the PGA Championship row in the available table of Chris DiMarco’s career aggregates.
- Interpreted “top - 25 be less than 4” as a strict inequality (< 4) and “cut made 6” as equality (= 6).
- Only the public."chris_dimarco" table was accessible; conclusions are grounded solely in this dataset.
