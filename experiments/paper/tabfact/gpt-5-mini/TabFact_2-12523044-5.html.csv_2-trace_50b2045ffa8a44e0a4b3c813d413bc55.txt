Claim interpreted: “Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy are the only players to score +1 to par.” I interpret this as referring to the ‘to par’ field in the available 2006 U.S. Open golf table.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect players and their to par values
SQL:
SELECT player, "to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY player;
Results (excerpt):
- arron oberholser — + 3
- colin montgomerie — e
- geoff ogilvy — + 1
- graeme mcdowell — + 3
- jason dufner — + 3
- jim furyk — + 2
- kenneth ferrie — + 1
- pádraig harrington — + 2
- phil mickelson — + 3
- steve stricker — - 1

2) Identify players with +1 to par (normalize spacing in the text field)
SQL:
SELECT player, "to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE replace(trim("to par"),' ','') = '+1' ORDER BY player;
Results:
- geoff ogilvy — + 1
- kenneth ferrie — + 1

3) Count players with +1 to par
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE replace(trim("to par"),' ','') = '+1';
Result:
- count = 2

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly two players with +1 to par: Geoff Ogilvy and Kenneth Ferrie. No other player in this dataset has +1 to par.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the ‘to par’ values in the 2006 U.S. Open table found in the available data.
- The ‘to par’ field is stored as text and may contain internal spaces (e.g., “+ 1”), so normalization via replace/trim is used to match “+1”.
