Summary
- The claim asserts that Richie Hearn held a qualifying time of 24.521 “before September 2003.”
- The Chicagoland Speedway table shows Richie Hearn recorded a qualifying time of 24.521 on September 6, 2003. This supports the driver and time, but contradicts the “before September 2003” part.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Full table inspection to locate relevant entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.chicagoland_speedway;
Key returned row:
- date: september 6 , 2003 | driver: richie hearn | record: qualifying | time: 24.521

2) Targeted lookup for Richie Hearn
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, record, time FROM chicagoland_speedway WHERE driver ILIKE 'Richie Hearn';
Result:
- date: september 6 , 2003; record: qualifying; time: 24.521

Assessment
- True: Richie Hearn is recorded with a qualifying time of 24.521 at Chicagoland Speedway.
- False: The timing qualifier “before September 2003” is contradicted by the recorded date (September 6, 2003), which is during September 2003, not before it.

Assumptions
- “Before September 2003” is interpreted as strictly prior to 2003-09-01.
- The “record: qualifying” field denotes a qualifying time record at Chicagoland Speedway as represented in the available dataset.
