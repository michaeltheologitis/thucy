What was checked
- Whether the elector holding the title “cardinal - priest of S. Anastasia” had an elevation date earlier than 1116, using the available TabFact database (papal_election_1119 table).

Key evidence from the data
1) Confirm the table exists
SQL:
SELECT to_regclass('public.papal_election_1119') AS table_exists;
Result:
[{"table_exists":"papal_election_1119"}]

2) Inspect columns
SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='papal_election_1119';
Result:
[{"column_name":"elector"},{"column_name":"nationality"},{"column_name":"cardinalatial order and title"},{"column_name":"elevated"},{"column_name":"elevator"}]

3) Find any elector whose title mentions S. Anastasia
SQL:
SELECT elector, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated
FROM papal_election_1119
WHERE "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%anastasia%';
Result:
- elector: bosone
  cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s anastasia
  elevated: circa 1116

4) Retrieve the full row for that elector
SQL:
SELECT * FROM papal_election_1119 WHERE "cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%Anastasia%';
Result:
{"cardinalatial order and title":"cardinal - priest of s anastasia","elector":"bosone","elevated":"circa 1116","elevator":"paschal ii","nationality":"italy"}

Assessment
- The title is explicitly recorded as “cardinal - priest of s anastasia,” which matches the cardinal order and title in the claim.
- The elevation date in the data is “circa 1116,” not earlier than 1116. The phrasing “circa 1116” indicates an approximate date around 1116, which does not provide evidence that the elevation occurred before 1116. Therefore, the specific assertion of “earlier than 1116” is not supported by the available data.

Conclusion
- Correct: The cardinal order and title is “cardinal - priest of s anastasia.”
- Not supported: The elevation being earlier than 1116. The data shows “circa 1116.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the individual in the 1119 papal election dataset whose title is “cardinal - priest of s anastasia” (elector: bosone).
- “Earlier than 1116” is interpreted strictly as a date prior to 1116; “circa 1116” is not treated as evidence of <1116.
