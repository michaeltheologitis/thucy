Claim to verify: “the 2009 hurricane season result in the lowest final position”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table found: public.dundee_hurricanes (columns: season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes)

Evidence gathered
1) Inspect the full table to see all seasons and final positions
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.dundee_hurricanes ORDER BY season;
Result (season | division | wins | losses | ties | final position | notes):
- 2003 | bafl division 2 north    | 6 | 4 | 0 | 4 / 11 | -
- 2004 | bafl division 2 north    | 6 | 2 | 1 | 1 / 3  | -
- 2005 | bafl division 2 scottish | 5 | 5 | 0 | 2 / 4  | -
- 2006 | bafl division 2 scottish | 3 | 4 | 0 | 2 / 3  | -
- 2007 | bafl division 2 north    | 9 | 1 | 0 | 1 / 6  | promoted to division 1 north
- 2008 | bafl division 1 north    | 5 | 2 | 3 | 3 / 6  | -
- 2009 | bafl division 1 north    | 2 | 6 | 1 | 5 / 7  | -

2) Confirm the format of the “final position” values
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "final position" FROM public.dundee_hurricanes ORDER BY "final position";
Result:
- 1 / 3, 1 / 6, 2 / 3, 2 / 4, 3 / 6, 4 / 11, 5 / 7

3) Parse finish position numbers and list by season
SQL executed:
SELECT season,
       CAST(trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1)) AS integer) AS finish_position,
       CAST(trim(split_part("final position", '/', 2)) AS integer) AS teams_in_division,
       (trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1)) || '/' || trim(split_part("final position", '/', 2)))::text AS rank_fraction
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
ORDER BY season;
Result:
- 2003: finish_position=4, teams=11, rank_fraction=4/11
- 2004: finish_position=1, teams=3,  rank_fraction=1/3
- 2005: finish_position=2, teams=4,  rank_fraction=2/4
- 2006: finish_position=2, teams=3,  rank_fraction=2/3
- 2007: finish_position=1, teams=6,  rank_fraction=1/6
- 2008: finish_position=3, teams=6,  rank_fraction=3/6
- 2009: finish_position=5, teams=7,  rank_fraction=5/7

4) Identify the best (minimum) and worst (maximum) numeric finish positions
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1))::int) AS min_pos,
       MAX(trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1))::int) AS max_pos
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes;
Result:
- min_pos = 1, max_pos = 5

SQL executed to list seasons at extremes:
SELECT season, "final position", trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1))::int AS pos_num
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
WHERE trim(split_part("final position", '/', 1))::int IN (1,5)
ORDER BY pos_num, season;
Result:
- min (1): seasons 2004 (1/3), 2007 (1/6)
- max (5): season 2009 (5/7)

Assessment
- If “lowest final position” is interpreted as the worst standing (i.e., the lowest placement in the table), then 2009 has the worst/lowest finish among listed seasons (5th), making the claim supported by the data.
- If “lowest” were interpreted as the smallest numeric rank (best finish), then 2009 would not qualify (that would be 2004 or 2007 with 1st place). However, in standings context, “lowest final position” typically refers to worst placement.

Conclusion
- The 2009 Dundee Hurricanes season resulted in the team’s worst final placing among the seasons shown (5th of 7).

Assumptions made
- “hurricane season” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes seasons in the available table, not meteorological hurricane seasons or other teams named Hurricanes.
- “lowest final position” is taken to mean the worst final standing (i.e., numerically highest finishing position).
