Claim being checked: "gold coast blaze win the most game in the season"

Scope and data used
- Available authoritative data source discovered: TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_nbl_season (teams’ records for the 2008–09 NBL season). Columns: team, lost, last 5, streak, home, away, % pts, % won.

Method
1) Inspect the table to confirm how wins can be computed (home/away stored as "W - L").
2) Compute total wins per team by parsing home and away fields and summing wins, then rank teams.
3) Identify the team(s) with the maximum wins and compare to Gold Coast Blaze.
4) Separately retrieve Gold Coast Blaze’s row to confirm their exact record.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Table inspection (field formats):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season;
Observed: home and away fields are strings in the form "W - L" (e.g., "13 - 2", "9 - 6").

2) Compute wins for all teams and rank:
SQL:
SELECT team,
       split_part(home,' - ',1)::int AS home_wins,
       split_part(away,' - ',1)::int AS away_wins,
       (split_part(home,' - ',1)::int + split_part(away,' - ',1)::int) AS total_wins
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
ORDER BY total_wins DESC, team;
Key results (total_wins):
- south dragons: 22
- melbourne tigers: 20
- new zealand breakers: 18
- perth wildcats: 17
- townsville crocodiles: 17
- adelaide 36ers: 15
- cairns taipans: 11
- sydney spirit: 11
- wollongong hawks: 11
- gold coast blaze: 8

3) Team(s) with the most wins:
SQL:
WITH wins AS (
  SELECT team,
         (split_part(home,' - ',1)::int + split_part(away,' - ',1)::int) AS total_wins
  FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
)
SELECT team, total_wins
FROM wins
WHERE total_wins = (SELECT MAX(total_wins) FROM wins)
ORDER BY team;
Result: south dragons | total_wins: 22 (highest in the table).

4) Gold Coast Blaze’s specific record:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team ILIKE 'Gold Coast Blaze';
Result: team = gold coast blaze; home = 6 - 9; away = 2 - 13; lost = 22; % won = 26.67.

SQL:
SELECT team, (split_part(home, ' - ', 1)::int + split_part(away, ' - ', 1)::int) AS wins, lost
FROM t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE team ILIKE 'Gold Coast Blaze';
Result: gold coast blaze | wins: 8 | lost: 22.

Findings
- In the 2008–09 NBL season, Gold Coast Blaze won 8 games in total.
- The most wins that season were by South Dragons with 22 wins.
- Therefore, Gold Coast Blaze did not win the most games in the season represented by the available data (2008–09 NBL).

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: Gold Coast Blaze did not have the most wins in the season; South Dragons did.

Assumptions and notes
- Interpreted the claim to refer to the only available season in the data (2008–09 NBL) and to mean “had the most wins in that season.”
- Parsed home/away fields as "wins - losses"; this was confirmed by inspection of the table.
