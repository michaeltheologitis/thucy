Claim to verify: “Arienai kisu be broadcast 14 day after the title with the earliest broadcast date.”

Summary conclusion: The episode with romanized title “arienai kisu” aired 7 days after the earliest broadcast date in the dataset, not 14 days. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact10)
- Schema: public
- Table: tsuki_no_koibito (columns: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, ratings)

Key evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve and parse the broadcast date for “arienai kisu”
SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')::date AS broadcast_date_parsed
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE lower("romanized title") = 'arienai kisu';
Result:
- romanized title: arienai kisu
- broadcast date (raw): may 17 , 2010
- parsed broadcast date: 2010-05-17

2) Compute the earliest broadcast date in the table
SQL:
SELECT MIN(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'))::date AS earliest_broadcast_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE "broadcast date" IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- earliest_broadcast_date: 2010-05-10

3) Identify the title with that earliest broadcast date
SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "romanized title", "broadcast date",
       to_date(initcap(trim(replace("broadcast date",' ,',','))), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_broadcast_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE to_date(initcap(trim(replace("broadcast date",' ,',','))), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') = DATE '2010-05-10';
Result:
- episode title: おまえが欲しい
- romanized title: omae ga hosii
- broadcast date (raw): may 10 , 2010
- parsed broadcast date: 2010-05-10

4) Compute the day difference between “arienai kisu” and the earliest broadcast date
SQL:
SELECT (
  to_date(initcap(regexp_replace((SELECT "broadcast date" FROM tsuki_no_koibito WHERE lower("romanized title")='arienai kisu' LIMIT 1), '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')::date
  -
  (SELECT MIN(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'))::date FROM tsuki_no_koibito WHERE "broadcast date" IS NOT NULL)
) AS diff_days;
Result:
- diff_days: 7

Finding:
- Earliest broadcast date: 2010-05-10 (episode “omae ga hosii”).
- “arienai kisu” broadcast date: 2010-05-17.
- Difference: 7 days, not 14 days.

Assumptions made:
- “arienai kisu” refers to the romanized title field in the tsuki_no_koibito table.
- “the title with the earliest broadcast date” refers to the episode whose parsed broadcast date is the minimum in this table.
- Date parsing standardized the stored text format by removing extra spaces around commas and using to_date with the format 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'.
