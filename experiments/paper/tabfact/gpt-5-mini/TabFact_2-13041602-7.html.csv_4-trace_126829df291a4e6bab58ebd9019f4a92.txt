Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season. Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count games with attendance > 30,000
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE attendance > 30000;
- Result:
num_games = 8

2) List those games (for transparency)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE attendance > 30000 ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  - september 16 — astros — 33767
  - september 17 — astros — 37756
  - september 18 — astros — 35052
  - september 20 — cubs — 30136
  - september 21 — cubs — 30049
  - september 22 — cubs — 31137
  - september 24 — cardinals — 33506
  - september 3 — padres — 32022

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 8 games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season with attendance greater than 30,000, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “more than 30000” as strictly > 30000 (not ≥ 30000). The table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season was treated as the authoritative game-by-game record for that season’s attendance.
