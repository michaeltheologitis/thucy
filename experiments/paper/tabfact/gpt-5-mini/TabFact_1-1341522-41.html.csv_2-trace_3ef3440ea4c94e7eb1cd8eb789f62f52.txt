Claim interpreted: The user asks whether William F. Goodling was “one of six Republican incumbents to be re‑elected.” I interpret this as a verification about a specific election cycle. The available authoritative dataset contains 1994 U.S. House election results for Pennsylvania districts (subset). I verify within this data.

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 (appears to contain Pennsylvania districts for the 1994 U.S. House elections; see evidence below)

Evidence 1 — William F. Goodling’s 1994 result
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, status FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Goodling%';
- Result:
  - district: pennsylvania19; incumbent: william f goodling; party: republican; status: re - elected
- Finding: Goodling (R-PA-19) is recorded as re - elected in this dataset.

Evidence 2 — Count of Republican incumbents re‑elected in Pennsylvania (per this table)
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
WHERE lower(district) LIKE '%pennsylvania%'
  AND lower(party) = 'republican'
  AND lower(status) LIKE '%re - elected%';
- Result: cnt = 5
- Executed SQL (list):
SELECT district, incumbent, party, status
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
WHERE lower(district) LIKE '%pennsylvania%'
  AND lower(party) = 'republican'
  AND lower(status) LIKE '%re - elected%'
ORDER BY district;
- Result rows:
  - pennsylvania17 — george gekas — republican — re - elected
  - pennsylvania19 — william f goodling — republican — re - elected
  - pennsylvania5 — william f clinger , jr — republican — re - elected
  - pennsylvania7 — curt weldon — republican — re - elected
  - pennsylvania9 — bud shuster — republican — re - elected
- Finding: The dataset shows 5 (not 6) Republican incumbents re‑elected among Pennsylvania districts represented here.

Evidence 3 — Table coverage indicates Pennsylvania-only subset
- Executed SQL (total rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994;
- Result: total_rows = 8
- Executed SQL (infer state prefix from district):
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(TRIM(substring(district FROM '^[A-Za-z]+'))) AS state_identifier
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
ORDER BY state_identifier NULLS LAST;
- Result: PENNSYLVANIA
- Executed SQL (distinct districts):
SELECT DISTINCT district FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 ORDER BY district;
- Result: pennsylvania12, pennsylvania17, pennsylvania18, pennsylvania19, pennsylvania4, pennsylvania5, pennsylvania7, pennsylvania9
- Finding: The table is a Pennsylvania-only subset for 1994 (8 districts listed), not a nationwide dataset.

Conclusion
- True: William F. Goodling was re‑elected (status = “re - elected”).
- Not supported: The specific numeric claim that he was “one of six” Republican incumbents re‑elected. In the available 1994 Pennsylvania dataset, there are 5 Republican incumbents re‑elected, not 6.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Year/context assumed to be the 1994 U.S. House elections because that is the authoritative data available here.
- Pennsylvania identification is via district strings containing “pennsylvania”.
- The table appears to be a subset covering eight Pennsylvania districts, not all districts statewide or nationwide. Conclusions are grounded in what this dataset contains.
