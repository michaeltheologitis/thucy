Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19)
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_all_that_episodes
- Relevant columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the episode with series = 47
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date" 
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE series = 47;
Result:
- season: 10; series: 47; episode title: chris farley / mint condition; original air date: january 11 , 1997

Derived month/year for series 47
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", split_part(lower("original air date"), ' ', 1) AS month_token, substring("original air date" from '([0-9]{4})') AS year_token
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE series = 47;
Result:
- month_token: january; year_token: 1997

2) Identify episode(s) with season = 2
Option A — first episode of season 2 by series order
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE season = 2
ORDER BY series ASC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- season: 2; series: 39; episode title: montell jordan; original air date: november 23 , 1996

Option B — list all season 2 entries and derive month/year tokens
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date",
       split_part(lower("original air date"), ' ', 1) AS month_token,
       substring("original air date" from '([0-9]{4})') AS year_token
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE season = 2
ORDER BY series ASC;
Result rows:
- season: 2; series: 39; episode title: montell jordan; original air date: november 23 , 1996; month_token: november; year_token: 1996
(Note: Only one season=2 row is present in this table.)

Assessment
- Series 47 episode month/year: January 1997
- Season 2 episode month/year (the only one present): November 1996
- Comparison: Months differ (January vs November) and years differ (1997 vs 1996).

Conclusion: The episode with series 47 was shown in a different month and year than the (only) episode listed with season 2 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “The episode that have season 2” was interpreted as the episode(s) in the table where season = 2. The table contains only one such row.
- “Series 47” refers to the numeric value in the series column.
