Claim interpreted: “there be no game that have rebound larger than 1048.” I interpret this as: within the available dataset, there is no record with total rebounds greater than 1048.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: rank, player, years, games, reb avg, total rebounds.

Evidence from the data
1) Maximum total rebounds
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX("total rebounds") AS max_total_rebounds FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: max_total_rebounds = 1048
- Implication: The highest value present for total rebounds is exactly 1048.

2) Any records with total rebounds > 1048?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT rank, player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE "total rebounds" > 1048
  ORDER BY "total rebounds" DESC;
- Result: No rows returned.
- Implication: There are no entries exceeding 1048 total rebounds.

3) Context: top entries by total rebounds
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT rank, player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
  FROM public.my_info_table
  ORDER BY "total rebounds" DESC
  LIMIT 10;
- Result (top 3 shown):
  1) rank: 1, player: jim nowers, total rebounds: 1048
  2) rank: 2, player: kenny sanders, total rebounds: 1026
  3) rank: 3, player: will thomas, total rebounds: 993
- Implication: The leaderboard confirms 1048 is the maximum.

4) Additional context (not directly required but clarifies units)
- Max games
  SQL: SELECT MAX(games) AS max_games FROM public.my_info_table;
  Result: 131
- Max reb avg
  SQL: SELECT MAX("reb avg") AS max_reb_avg FROM public.my_info_table;
  Result: 9.6

Conclusion
- The dataset shows no record with total rebounds greater than 1048. Therefore, the claim (that none exceed 1048) is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “game … have rebound” as referring to the “total rebounds” metric in the available table (which is player-level totals), since the dataset does not contain per-game rebound counts. The verification is thus scoped to the available table and its definition of rebounds.
