Claim to verify: “manchester unite have be 2nd in league position since 17 november 2005.”

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available season data. In the 2005–06 season, Manchester United were not consistently 2nd from (or immediately after) 17 November 2005; they were 3rd on 19 November 2005 and again on 11 December 2005. Thus, the assertion that they have been 2nd since that date is inaccurate according to the authoritative dataset accessible here.

Data sources discovered
- Accessible database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season

Schema summary for the relevant table (from schema inspection)
- Columns: date (TEXT), opponents (TEXT), h / a (TEXT), result f - a (TEXT), attendance (BIGINT), league position (TEXT)
- Interpretation: Each row is a match in the 2005–06 season with the team’s league position recorded for that match date.

Evidence from executed queries
1) Inspect stored dates (to determine parsing format)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 200;
Key observation: Dates are stored as text in the format “DD monthname YYYY” (e.g., “19 november 2005”).

2) All rows on or after 2005-11-17 (parsed), showing league position
SQL executed:
SELECT date, to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, opponents, "league position"
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') >= DATE '2005-11-17'
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC;
Results (excerpt of key rows):
- 2005-11-19 vs Charlton Athletic — league position: 3rd
- 2005-11-27 vs West Ham United — league position: 2nd
- 2005-12-03 vs Portsmouth — league position: 2nd
- 2005-12-11 vs Everton — league position: 3rd
- 2005-12-14 through 2006-05-07 — mostly 2nd (per-row details in the query results)

3) Distinct league positions in the period on/after 2005-11-17
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "league position" AS league_position
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') >= DATE '2005-11-17'
ORDER BY league_position;
Result: 2nd, 3rd
Interpretation: They were not exclusively 2nd in this timeframe.

4) Focused window around November–mid December 2005 for clarity
SQL executed:
SELECT date, to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, opponents, "league position"
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '2005-11-01' AND DATE '2005-12-15'
ORDER BY parsed_date;
Results:
- 2005-11-06 vs Chelsea — league position: 4th
- 2005-11-19 vs Charlton Athletic — league position: 3rd
- 2005-11-27 vs West Ham United — league position: 2nd
- 2005-12-03 vs Portsmouth — league position: 2nd
- 2005-12-11 vs Everton — league position: 3rd
- 2005-12-14 vs Wigan Athletic — league position: 2nd

Assessment of the claim
- The claim asserts a continuous 2nd-place standing since 17 November 2005. The available 2005–06 season data shows this is false: immediately after that date (on 2005-11-19) United were 3rd, and again on 2005-12-11 they were 3rd. Therefore, the claim does not hold even within the season contemporaneous to the stated date.

Assumptions and scope
- “League position” is interpreted as the team’s standing as of the match date recorded in each row, based on the table’s structure.
- The table covers Manchester United’s 2005–06 season only; broader historical verification beyond this season is outside the accessible dataset. Nonetheless, within this season, the claim is clearly contradicted by the data.
- Dates were parsed from text using the format DD Month YYYY (e.g., ‘19 november 2005’), as verified by the inspection query.
