Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered one PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema). One table available: public.tim_lajcik.

Relevant schema details (from public.tim_lajcik):
- Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distribution of results in the res column
- SQL executed:
  SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  GROUP BY res
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result:
  - res = 'win'  -> cnt = 7
  - res = 'loss' -> cnt = 6
  - res = 'draw' -> cnt = 1

2) Totals of wins and losses, and comparison
- SQL executed:
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN lower(res) LIKE 'win%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
         SUM(CASE WHEN lower(res) LIKE 'loss%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses
  FROM public.tim_lajcik;
- Result:
  - wins = 7
  - losses = 6

Conclusion:
- The data show there are 7 wins and 6 losses. Therefore, there are more win results than loss results in this table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the public.tim_lajcik table and its res column, where values such as 'win' and 'loss' denote outcomes.
- Treated 'draw' as neither win nor loss.
- Matching was case-insensitive and allowed for potential prefixes (e.g., 'win', 'loss').
