Claim to verify (interpreted):
- VCA 155 has a weight of 40 t (44.1 tons) and mounts a 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer.
- VCTM has a power-to-weight ratio of 28.8 hp/t (25.1 hp/ton) and mounts a 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact6), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.tam_tank (columns: vctp, vca 155, vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt — all text).

Executed SQL (evidence):
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;

Key returned rows/cells (by interpretation of row categories):
- Row 1 (weights):
  • vca 155: "40t (44.1tons)"  • vctm: "26t (28.7tons)"
- Row 2 (armament):
  • vca 155: "155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer"  • vctm: "120 mm (4.72in) mortar"
- Row 4 (power-to-weight):
  • vca 155: "18hp / t ( 16.5hp / ton)"  • vctm: "28.8hp / t (25.1hp / ton)"

Assessment of each sub-claim against evidence:
- VCA 155 weight = 40 t (44.1 tons): Supported (Row 1, vca 155).
- VCA 155 armament = 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer: Supported (Row 2, vca 155).
- VCTM power-to-weight = 28.8 hp/t (25.1 hp/ton): Supported (Row 4, vctm).
- VCTM armament = 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar: Supported (Row 2, vctm).

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are directly supported by the data returned from the tam_tank table via the SQL shown above.

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “respectively” maps VCA 155 to weight and howitzer caliber, and VCTM to power-to-weight and mortar caliber.
- The table rows represent categories (Row 1 = weight, Row 2 = armament, Row 4 = power-to-weight), inferred from their contents.
