Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a table containing 2011 GDP (PPP) data in billions of USD for Asian and Pacific countries.
- Inspected the table schema to confirm the exact units and year.
- Queried the table for Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) value and compared it against the claim.

Data source and schema
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
- Relevant column (per schema): "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" — double precision (explicitly in billions of USD)

Executed SQL and results
1) Query
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" AS gdp_2011_bil_usd
FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
WHERE country ILIKE '%Israel%';

Result
- country: israel
- gdp_2011_bil_usd: 235.446

Assessment
- The dataset reports Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) as 235.446 billions of USD.
- The claim states “235446” (billions USD). If taken literally as billions, that would be 235,446 billions USD (i.e., 235.446 trillion), which is inconsistent with the data and implausible.
- The value 235,446 would match if the unit were millions of USD (i.e., 235.446 billions), but the claim explicitly specifies billions of USD.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported as stated. The correct value per the data source is 235.446 billions USD for 2011.

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive country name matching was used to retrieve the Israel record.
- The table’s unit labeling (billions of USD) is taken as authoritative for interpreting magnitudes.
