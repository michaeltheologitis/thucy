Summary of verification
- Claim: "industrial and commercial panel have 4 more member than cultural and educational panel"
- Interpreted scope: Totals by panel in the available dataset covering the 5th Seanad (public.members_of_the_5th_seanad), summing across parties.

Data source discovery
- Using the discovery tool, one accessible source was found: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.

Relevant schema
- Table: public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  - Columns: party; administrative panel; agricultural panel; cultural and educational panel; industrial and commercial panel; labour panel; national university of ireland; university of dublin; nominated by the taoiseach; total.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Total members in the Industrial and Commercial Panel
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM("industrial and commercial panel") AS industrial_total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result: industrial_total = 16

2) Total members in the Cultural and Educational Panel
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM("cultural and educational panel") AS cultural_total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result: cultural_total = 9

3) Difference (Industrial and Commercial minus Cultural and Educational)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM("industrial and commercial panel") - SUM("cultural and educational panel") AS difference FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result: difference = 7

Additional context check (totals across panels)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM("administrative panel") AS administrative_total,
         SUM("agricultural panel") AS agricultural_total,
         SUM("cultural and educational panel") AS cultural_and_educational_total,
         SUM("industrial and commercial panel") AS industrial_and_commercial_total,
         SUM("labour panel") AS labour_total
  FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result: Administrative = 12; Agricultural = 21; Cultural & Educational = 9; Industrial & Commercial = 16; Labour = 17.

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative dataset available, the Industrial and Commercial Panel total (16) exceeds the Cultural and Educational Panel total (9) by 7, not 4. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim did not specify a time period; I interpreted it using the only accessible structured source that references these panels, namely the 5th Seanad table, and summed across parties to obtain panel totals.
