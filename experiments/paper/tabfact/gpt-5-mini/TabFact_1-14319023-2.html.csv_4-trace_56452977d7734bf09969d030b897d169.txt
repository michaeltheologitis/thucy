Summary answer:
- There is no year after 2007 in which the girls’ singles winner is Lindaweni Fanetri and the mixed doubles winners are Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto. The only year with that combination in the data is 2007 itself.

Key evidence from the database:
1) Full table (to inspect winners across years)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships ORDER BY year;

Returned rows (excerpt relevant to this question):
- 2007: girls singles = "lindaweni fanetri"; mixed doubles = "wifqi windarto debby susanto"
- 2008: girls singles = "ana rovita"; mixed doubles = "irfan fadhilah weni anggraeni"
- 2009: girls singles = "ana rovita"; mixed doubles = "didit juang indrianto yayu rahayu"
- 2010: girls singles = "ganis nur rahmadani"; mixed doubles = "jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico"

2) Direct check for the requested combination after 2007 (case-insensitive substring matching)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "year", "girls singles", "mixed doubles"
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE "year" > 2007
  AND "girls singles" ILIKE '%lindaweni fanetri%'
  AND "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%wifqi windarto%'
  AND "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%debby susanto%'
ORDER BY "year";

Result: 0 rows returned (no match after 2007).

3) Locate any year with that exact combination (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "girls singles", "mixed doubles"
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE lower("girls singles") = 'lindaweni fanetri'
  AND lower("mixed doubles") LIKE '%wifqi windarto%'
  AND lower("mixed doubles") LIKE '%debby susanto%';

Result:
- year: 2007; girls singles: lindaweni fanetri; mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanto

Conclusion:
- The combination “girls singles = Lindaweni Fanetri” and “mixed doubles = Wifqi Windarto/Debby Susanto” occurs in 2007. It does not occur after 2007 in the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “After the year 2007” was interpreted as year > 2007.
- Name matching used case-insensitive comparisons and substring matches to allow for formatting differences.
- The question was interpreted as asking whether (and when) this combination occurs after 2007; the answer is that it does not, and it occurred in 2007 instead.
