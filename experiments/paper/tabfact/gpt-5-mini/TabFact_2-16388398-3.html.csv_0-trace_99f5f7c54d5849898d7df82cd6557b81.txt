Summary
- Claim: “the home team score 17.5 (107) on sunday , january 30.”
- Finding: In the 2000 Ansett Australia Cup table, there is a match on “sunday , 30 january” where the home team (adelaide) scored 17.5 (107). This supports the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_2000_ansett_australia_cup with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "ground", "crowd", "date" (scores and date stored as text).

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Identify exact date string formatting in the table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup ORDER BY "date";
Result (excerpt):
- monday , 14 february
- saturday , 5 february
- sunday , 13 february
- sunday , 30 january
- sunday , 6 february
Interpretation: The table stores the target date as “sunday , 30 january”.

2) Retrieve all matches on that date
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "ground", "crowd", "date"
FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup
WHERE "date" = 'sunday , 30 january';
Results:
1) home team: adelaide | home team score: 17.5 (107) | away team: melbourne | away team score: 19.11 (125) | ground: football park | crowd: 12239 | date: sunday , 30 january
2) home team: geelong | home team score: 10.14 (74) | away team: st kilda | away team score: 11.12 (78) | ground: waverley park | crowd: 7394 | date: sunday , 30 january

Assessment
- The data shows that on “sunday , 30 january,” at least one home team (adelaide) scored 17.5 (107). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Scope: The verification is grounded in the 2000 Ansett Australia Cup dataset (table t_2000_ansett_australia_cup). The date strings do not include a year, but the table pertains to 2000; January 30, 2000 was a Sunday.
- Interpretation: The claim is interpreted existentially (i.e., that there exists a home team on that date with that score), not that every home team on that date had that score.
