Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns including: period (text), cdr (double precision), life expectancy total (double precision), among others.

Step 1: Understand available time periods
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT period FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY period;
Results:
- 1950 - 1955
- 1955 - 1960
- 1960 - 1965
- 1965 - 1970
- 1970 - 1975
- 1975 - 1980
- 1980 - 1985
- 1985 - 1990
- 1990 - 1995
- 1995 - 2000
- 2000 - 2005

Step 2: Retrieve life expectancy (total) and CDR for 1950 - 1955
Executed SQL:
SELECT period, cdr, "life expectancy total" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '1950 - 1955';
Result row:
- period: 1950 - 1955
- cdr: 15.5
- life expectancy total: 50.9

Assessment of the claim
- Claim component 1: "total life expectancy in 1950 - 1955 > 70.1"
  - Data: 50.9
  - Evaluation: 50.9 > 70.1 is FALSE.
- Claim component 2: "cdr < 32.5"
  - Data: 15.5
  - Evaluation: 15.5 < 32.5 is TRUE.
- Overall (AND condition): One component is false, so the combined claim is not satisfied.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim overall: life expectancy total is well below 70.1, though the CDR is indeed below 32.5.

Assumptions
- Treated period as the exact text value '1950 - 1955' in the period column.
- Interpreted "cdr" as crude death rate and "life expectancy total" as years, using values directly as stored in the table.
