Claim interpreted: Episode 28 is titled “The Suspension.”

Data source checked: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18), schema public, table my_info_table, which contains episode, series, episode title, original air date, and production code.

Evidence and results:
- Query objective: Retrieve any records where episode = 28 and inspect the title.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date", "production code"
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE episode = 28;
- Result:
  • episode: 28
  • series: 2
  • episode title: the suspension
  • original air date: 6 april 2008
  • production code: 202

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows that episode 28 has the title "the suspension" (case-insensitive match to “The Suspension”). The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- “Episode 28” refers to the episode column (global episode numbering as stored) in my_info_table.
- Title matching treats case as non-substantive ("the suspension" ≈ "The Suspension").
- No specific series was specified; we accepted the single matching row (series 2) as the target of the claim.
