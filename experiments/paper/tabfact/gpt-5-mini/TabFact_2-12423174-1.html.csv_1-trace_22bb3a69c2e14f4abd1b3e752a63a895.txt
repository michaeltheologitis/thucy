Summary of finding
- The TabFact database contains a table for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs. It shows a tie where Young Africans faced Lavori Publici. The recorded results are: 1st leg 2–0, 2nd leg 0–0, aggregate 2–0. This indicates Young Africans scored 2 goals in that competition tie.
- The claim uses the term “points,” but the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs was a knockout competition decided by aggregate goals, not league points. Interpreting “points” as “goals,” the data supports the claim that Young Africans scored 2.

Interpretation
- The aggregate score of 2–0, with a first leg of 2–0 and a second leg of 0–0, shows Young Africans scored a total of 2 goals in their 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs matchup. If “points” is intended to mean “goals,” the claim is supported.

Assumptions made
- “points” is interpreted as “goals,” since the tournament format was knockout by aggregate goals rather than a points-based league format.
- The single row returned represents the entirety of Young Africans’ participation in the 1971 edition within this data source.
