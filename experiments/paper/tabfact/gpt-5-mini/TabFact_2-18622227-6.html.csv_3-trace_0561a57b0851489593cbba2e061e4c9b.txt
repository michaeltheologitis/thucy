Claim to verify: "each tournament have the same result in the year 1990 and 1999"

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15)
- Schema: public
- Table: katrina_adams
- Columns: tournament (text), and year-result columns including "1990" (text) and "1999" (text)

Evidence gathered via executed SQL:
1) Count total tournaments (rows)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_tournaments FROM public.katrina_adams;
Result: total_tournaments = 5

2) Count tournaments where 1990 result differs from 1999 result (treating NULL=NULL as equal)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_diff FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE "1990" IS DISTINCT FROM "1999";
Result: count_diff = 4

3) List tournaments where 1990 and 1999 results differ
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1990" AS result_1990, "1999" AS result_1999
FROM public.katrina_adams
WHERE "1990" IS DISTINCT FROM "1999"
ORDER BY tournament;
Results:
- australian open: result_1990 = 3r, result_1999 = 1r
- french open: result_1990 = 3r, result_1999 = 1r
- us open: result_1990 = 3r, result_1999 = 1r
- wimbledon: result_1990 = 3r, result_1999 = 1r

Conclusion:
- Out of 5 tournaments, 4 have different results between 1990 and 1999. Therefore, it is not true that each tournament has the same result in those years.

Assumptions made:
- Each row in public.katrina_adams represents a tournament.
- "Same result" means the value in column "1990" equals the value in column "1999"; NULLs are treated as equal using PostgreSQL’s IS DISTINCT FROM operator.
