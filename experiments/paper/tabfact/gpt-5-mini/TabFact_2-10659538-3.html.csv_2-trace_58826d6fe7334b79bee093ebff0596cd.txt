Claim to verify: “66189 crowd attend the game with a record of 6 - 1 on week 8.”

Data source discovered
- Database: postgres_tabfact1 (TabFact)
- Table: public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season (game-by-game data: week, date, opponent, result, season record, TV time, attendance) for the 2001 St. Louis Rams season

Key evidence from the data
1) Week 8 row contents (to check if Week 8 has attendance and record)
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance
FROM public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season
WHERE week = 8;
Result:
- week: 8, date: -, opponent: -, result: -, record: -, attendance: NULL
Interpretation: Week 8 data is missing in this dataset; no attendance or record is provided for Week 8.

2) Locate any game with attendance = 66189 (to see which week had that crowd)
SQL executed:
SELECT week, opponent, result, record
FROM public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season
WHERE attendance = 66189;
Result:
- week: 7, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 34 - 31, record: 6 - 1
Interpretation: The 66,189 attendance corresponds to Week 7, not Week 8. After that game, the team’s record is 6 - 1.

3) Locate any game where the season record is exactly '6 - 1'
SQL executed:
SELECT week, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season
WHERE record = '6 - 1';
Result:
- week: 7, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 34 - 31, attendance: 66189
Interpretation: The season record of 6 - 1 appears after Week 7, and that game had an attendance of 66,189.

Assessment
- The specific attendance figure (66,189) and the record “6 - 1” both align with Week 7 in this dataset, not Week 8.
- Week 8 data is missing (no attendance or record shown), so the claim that Week 8 had 66,189 in attendance with a 6 - 1 record is contradicted by the available data.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported: 66,189 attendance and a 6 - 1 record correspond to Week 7, and Week 8 has no recorded attendance or record in this dataset.

Assumptions made
- The queryable dataset (2001 St. Louis Rams season) is the intended context for the claim. If the claim refers to a different team/season, that context is not present in the accessible data sources.
