Claim to verify: "all 5 match hold in october of 1978 take place after the 25th of the month"

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL source: TabFact (public schema).
- Identified a single relevant table containing match/event data: public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland.

Schema summary (relevant table)
- Columns: "opposing team" (text), "against" (bigint), "date" (text), "venue" (text), "status" (text)

Evidence from executed queries
1) List all rows to view dates and confirm October 1978 entries
SQL:
SELECT "opposing team", "against", "date", "venue", "status"
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland;
Result (excerpt for October 1978):
- cambridge university | 18 october 1978
- cardiff | 21 october 1978
- west wales xv | 25 october 1978
- london counties | 28 october 1978
- munster | 31 october 1978

2) Parse dates and check which October 1978 matches occurred after Oct 25
SQL:
SELECT "date" AS raw_date, to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, "opposing team", "venue", (to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') > DATE '1978-10-25') AS occurred_after_25th
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-10-31'
ORDER BY parsed_date;
Result:
- 1978-10-18 (cambridge university) — occurred_after_25th: false
- 1978-10-21 (cardiff) — occurred_after_25th: false
- 1978-10-25 (west wales xv) — occurred_after_25th: false
- 1978-10-28 (london counties) — occurred_after_25th: true
- 1978-10-31 (munster) — occurred_after_25th: true

3) Count of matches in October 1978
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS october_1978_matches
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-10-31';
Result:
- october_1978_matches: 5

Assessment
- There are exactly 5 matches in October 1978.
- Only 2 of the 5 took place after October 25 (on the 28th and 31st). Three did not (18th, 21st, and 25th itself). Therefore, the claim that all five took place after the 25th is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is false according to the table’s data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "match hold in october of 1978" as the matches listed in the table for October 1978.
- Interpreted "after the 25th" strictly as dates > 1978-10-25 (exclusive).
