Summary
- Claim interpreted: The match score was 2 - 2 in a game where the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion.
- Scope: Verified against the available TabFact (postgres_tabfact11) database, public schema, table t_1990_91_fa_cup (1990–91 FA Cup results).

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1990_91_fa_cup with columns [tie no, home team, score, away team, date].

Evidence
1) Locate all matches where the away team mentions “Brighton”
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", score, "away team", date
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%brighton%';

Result:
- tie no: 1 | home team: liverpool | score: 2 - 2 | away team: brighton & hove albion | date: 26 / 01 / 1991

2) Check distinct scores for rows where away team equals “brighton & hove albion” (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT score, count(*) AS cnt
FROM public."t_1990_91_fa_cup"
WHERE lower("away team") = 'brighton & hove albion'
GROUP BY score
ORDER BY cnt DESC, score;

Result:
- 2 - 2: 1 occurrence

Conclusion
- The data shows a match where the away team is Brighton & Hove Albion and the recorded score is 2 - 2. No other scores are associated with Brighton & Hove Albion as the away team in this dataset. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “brighton and heave albion” was interpreted as “Brighton & Hove Albion.”
- Verification is limited to the available dataset (1990–91 FA Cup table).
