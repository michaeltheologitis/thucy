Claim to verify: “running back Calvin O’Neal was drafted with pick 24 of round 6.”

Data source discovery:
- Tool identified one available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13), public schema, containing table indianapolis_colts_draft_history (draft history for the Colts franchise).

Schema examined:
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)
  Note: No year column.

Evidence queries and results:
1) Locate Calvin O’Neal’s draft entry (name-normalized to handle apostrophes):
SQL:
SELECT name, position, round, pick, overall
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE regexp_replace(lower(name), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g') = 'calvinoneal';
Result:
- name: calvin o'neal
- position: linebacker
- round: 6
- pick (within round): 24
- overall: 163

2) Check for any other similarly named entries (to confirm uniqueness):
SQL:
SELECT name, position, round, pick, overall
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE regexp_replace(lower(name), '[^a-z0-9]', '', 'g') LIKE '%oneal%'
ORDER BY name;
Result: Only the same single Calvin O’Neal record returned.

Assessment:
- The pick details are supported: Calvin O’Neal was drafted in round 6 with pick 24 (overall 163) by the Colts franchise.
- The position stated in the claim is incorrect: data shows he was a linebacker, not a running back.

Conclusion: The drafting round/pick is correct; the position is not.

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the NFL Draft and the Colts franchise (Baltimore/Indianapolis) covered by this table.
- Name normalization appropriately resolves apostrophe variations (O’Neal/O'Neal/Oneal).
