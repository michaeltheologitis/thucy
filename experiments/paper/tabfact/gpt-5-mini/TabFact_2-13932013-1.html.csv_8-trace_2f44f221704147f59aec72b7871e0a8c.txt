Summary
- Claim: “only 10 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games.”
- Finding: The data shows 6 quarterbacks with more than 30 wins as a starter for the Cleveland Browns, not 10.

Data sources explored
- Discovered source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with table public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
- Relevant columns: quarterback (text), games started (bigint), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), winning pct (double precision).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) List quarterbacks with more than 30 wins and their totals
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE wins > 30 ORDER BY wins DESC;
Result:
- sipe , brian — 57
- graham , otto — 57
- kosar , bernie — 53
- ryan , frank — 52
- nelsen , bill — 34
- plum , milt — 33

2) Count quarterbacks with more than 30 wins
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_qbs_over_30_wins FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE wins > 30;
Result:
- count_qbs_over_30_wins: 6

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim. There are 6, not 10, Cleveland Browns quarterbacks with more than 30 wins as starters.

Assumptions
- “Win more than 30 game” was interpreted as strictly greater than 30 wins as a starter (wins > 30) with the Browns.
- The table provides one aggregate record per quarterback for their Browns starting record and is authoritative for this verification.
