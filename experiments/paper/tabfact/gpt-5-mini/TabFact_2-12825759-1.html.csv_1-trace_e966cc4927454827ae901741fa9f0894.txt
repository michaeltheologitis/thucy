Claim to verify: "twickenham stoop be the venue on 6 april 2007 , where the score be 22 - 12"

Available data sources explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact32 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988
  - Columns: date (text), venue (text), opponent (text), result (text), tournament (text), scored (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify any match on 6 April 2007 and see its venue and score
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, opponent, result, tournament, scored
  FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988
  WHERE trim(date) ~* '^0?6\s+(Apr|April)\s+2007$';
- Result:
  - date: 6 april 2007
    venue: twickenham stoop
    opponent: harlequins rl
    result: 30 - 28
    tournament: super league
    scored: 1
- Finding: There is a match on 6 April 2007 at Twickenham Stoop. The recorded final score is 30 - 28, not 22 - 12.

2) Check if any match in the table has a final score of 22-12 (any common dash and spacing)
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count
  FROM craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988
  WHERE result ~ '22\s*[-–:]\s*12';
- Result: match_count = 0 (no such scores found)

3) Check the reversed ordering 12-22 (in case of home/away formatting)
- Executed SQL (rows):
  SELECT date, venue, opponent, result, tournament, scored
  FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988
  WHERE result ~ '12[[:space:]]*[-–—][[:space:]]*22';
- Result: no rows returned
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988
  WHERE result ~ '12[[:space:]]*[-–—][[:space:]]*22';
- Result: match_count = 0

4) Directly test whether any 6 April 2007 row has result 22-12 (case-insensitive date matching)
- Executed SQL (list rows on that date, case-insensitive):
  SELECT * FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988 WHERE lower(date) = lower('6 April 2007');
- Result:
  - date: 6 april 2007; venue: twickenham stoop; opponent: harlequins rl; result: 30 - 28; tournament: super league; scored: 1
- Executed SQL (same date, test for result 22-12):
  SELECT * FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988 WHERE lower(date) = lower('6 April 2007') AND trim(lower(result)) = lower('22-12');
- Result: no rows returned

Conclusion
- True: Twickenham Stoop was the venue on 6 April 2007 (as per the table row).
- False: The score was not 22 - 12; the recorded result is 30 - 28.

Final assessment: The claim mixes a correct venue and date with an incorrect score.

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim as referring to the match data contained in the available table (public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988), which we treat as authoritative for verification.
- "Score be 22 - 12" refers to the final match result recorded in the result column.
- Date matching was done case-insensitively and allowed for common textual formatting (e.g., "6 April 2007").
