Summary
- Claim: In Lukáš Melich’s last 2 competitions he threw an average distance of 78.27 m.
- Finding: Verified by computing the mean of the two most recent competition distances in the authoritative dataset.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24)
- Table: public.luk_melich
- Columns: year (bigint), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text)
- Distances are stored in the notes column as text like "79.36 m".

Evidence and SQL
1) Identify the last two competitions (highest year values) and extract distances
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, notes,
       NULLIF(regexp_replace(notes, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'), '')::numeric AS distance_m
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE notes ~ '[0-9]'
ORDER BY year DESC
LIMIT 2;
Results:
- year: 2013, competition: world championships, distance_m: 79.36
- year: 2012, competition: olympic games, distance_m: 77.17

2) Compute the average of those two distances, rounded to 2 decimals
SQL:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(distance_m)::numeric, 2) AS avg_distance_m
FROM (
  SELECT NULLIF(regexp_replace(notes, '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'), '')::numeric AS distance_m
  FROM public.luk_melich
  WHERE notes ~ '[0-9]'
  ORDER BY year DESC
  LIMIT 2
) t;
Result:
- avg_distance_m: 78.27

Conclusion
- The average distance across Lukáš Melich’s last two competitions in the dataset is 78.27 m, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “Last 2 competitions” are interpreted as the two rows with the highest year values (2013 and 2012) in public.luk_melich.
- Throw distance is the numeric value recorded in the notes column (e.g., “79.36 m”).
