Claim to verify: “Melbourne be the home team when the team meet at Adelaide.”

Summary conclusion: In the available data (2000 Ansett Australia Cup), when Melbourne played at an Adelaide venue, Melbourne were the away team, not the home team.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (Postgres), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "ground", "crowd", "date".

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Identify grounds used in Melbourne’s matches
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT ground FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%';
Result:
[{"ground":"football park"},{"ground":"waverley park"}]
Interpretation: “Football Park” is an Adelaide venue.

2) Retrieve the Adelaide-venue match involving Melbourne
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", ground, date FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup WHERE ("home team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%') AND ground ILIKE '%football park%';
Result:
[{"home team":"adelaide","away team":"melbourne","ground":"football park","date":"sunday , 30 january"}]
Interpretation: Adelaide was the home team; Melbourne was away at Football Park (Adelaide).

3) Check if there are any instances of Melbourne as the home team at Adelaide venues
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup WHERE "home team" = 'Melbourne' AND ("ground" ILIKE '%adelaide%' OR "ground" ILIKE '%football park%' OR "ground" ILIKE '%adelaide oval%');
Result:
match_count = 0
Interpretation: No matches where Melbourne is home at an Adelaide venue in this dataset.

4) List all matches at Adelaide venues to confirm home designations
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "ground", "date" FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup WHERE lower("ground") IN ('football park', 'adelaide oval') ORDER BY "date";
Results:
1) adelaide — st kilda — football park — sunday , 13 february
2) adelaide — melbourne — football park — sunday , 30 january
3) adelaide — geelong — football park — sunday , 6 february
Interpretation: In all Adelaide-venue matches present, the home team is Adelaide; Melbourne appears as away.

Final assessment: The data contradicts the claim. When Melbourne met at an Adelaide venue (Football Park) in this dataset, they were the away team, not the home team.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- Interpreted “meet at Adelaide” as matches played at Adelaide venues (Football Park or Adelaide Oval).
- Scope is limited to the available dataset (2000 Ansett Australia Cup). Within this scope, the claim is false; we make no claims beyond the dataset provided.
