Claim to verify: “galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible dataset: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13)
- Available table: public.galina_voskoboeva

Schema details (from tool)
- Columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)
- No keys or constraints

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any opponents faced more than once
SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS matches
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
WHERE opponent IS NOT NULL AND opponent <> ''
GROUP BY opponent
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY matches DESC, opponent;
Result: No rows returned (no opponent appears more than once).

2) Summary stats and normalization check (lowercase, trim, collapse internal whitespace)
2a) Total matches
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
Result: total_matches = 5

2b) Unique opponents (raw)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS unique_opponents_raw FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
Result: unique_opponents_raw = 5

2c) Unique opponents (normalized)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT lower(regexp_replace(trim(opponent), '\s+', ' ', 'g'))) AS unique_opponents_normalized FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
Result: unique_opponents_normalized = 5

2d) Maximum number of matches against any single normalized opponent
SQL:
SELECT normalized, cnt FROM (
  SELECT lower(regexp_replace(trim(opponent), '\s+', ' ', 'g')) AS normalized,
         COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  GROUP BY normalized
) t
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result: normalized = 'oleksandra kravets', cnt = 1

3) Full match list for transparency
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, opponent, outcome, score FROM public.galina_voskoboeva ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') ASC;
Results (ordered by date ascending):
- 28 january 2003 | tipton | matea mezak | runner - up | 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6
- 29 june 2003 | mont - de - marsan | oleksandra kravets | winner | 6 - 4 , 6 - 2
- 3 october 2003 | latina | roberta vinci | runner - up | 3 - 6 , 4 - 6

Conclusion
- Based on the contents of public.galina_voskoboeva, Galina Voskoboeva did not face any opponent more than once. All checks—including a normalization step to mitigate minor name-format differences—show each opponent appears exactly once.

Assumptions
- Treating the discovered dataset as authoritative for this verification task.
- Opponent names are consistently recorded; normalization (lowercase/trim/collapse spaces) was applied to reduce formatting-induced duplication risk.
