Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a table with Texas Rangers 2005 season game logs containing pitcher info.
- Inspected the table schema to confirm it holds winning/losing pitcher fields.
- Queried the table for games where the winning pitcher is Roy Oswalt and examined the losing pitcher.

Data sources discovered
- Database: postgres_tabfact16 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2005_texas_rangers_season
  - Columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)

Executed SQL and results
1) Find games where the winning pitcher is Roy Oswalt
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", location, attendance
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
WHERE "winning pitcher" ILIKE '%Roy Oswalt%'
ORDER BY date;

Result:
- date: june 24
  winning team: houston
  score: 5 - 2
  winning pitcher: roy oswalt
  losing pitcher: ricardo rodríguez
  location: houston
  attendance: 36199

Conclusion
- The data shows a game on June 24 where Roy Oswalt was the winning pitcher and Ricardo Rodríguez was the losing pitcher. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- I treated the table as a complete record of the Texas Rangers’ 2005 game log and used a case-insensitive search for the winning pitcher’s name. The date field is text without a year in this dataset, but context implies the 2005 season.
