Summary
- Claim: “there be 2 time the attendance be over 50000.”
- Interpretation: Within the available dataset, count how many games had attendance > 50,000.
- Conclusion: The data shows exactly 2 such instances.

Data discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema).
- Accessible table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season.

Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
  - The attendance column is numeric (bigint) and represents game attendance.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count of games with attendance > 50000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE attendance > 50000;
- Result: cnt = 2

2) List the games where attendance > 50000 (for transparency)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE attendance > 50000 ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  - date: september 5, opponent: dodgers, attendance: 52270
  - date: september 7, opponent: dodgers, attendance: 54137

Assessment
- The dataset records exactly two rows where attendance exceeded 50,000. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the accessible dataset (public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season). Ordering by the text-based date does not affect the count.
