Claim to verify: "andre owens play center for the jazz from 2005 - 06"

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster

Schema details (relevant columns):
- player (text)
- position (text)
- years for jazz (text)

Evidence query and result:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Andre%' OR player ILIKE '%Owens%';
- Result row:
  player: andre owens
  position: guard
  years for jazz: 2005 - 06

Assessment of the claim:
- Team and years: Supported. The table lists "andre owens" with "years for jazz: 2005 - 06".
- Position: Contradicted. The table lists his position as "guard", not "center".

Conclusion: The player and timeframe are correct, but the position is not.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "from 2005 - 06" as the 2005–06 season.
- Treated the utah_jazz_all_time_roster table as authoritative for the Utah Jazz roster, positions, and years.
