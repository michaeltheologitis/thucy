Claim to verify: “the volume that have 1 disc, 4 episode, and a region 1 of may 30 , 2006 be volume 5.”

Data source consulted:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact1)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table(volume bigint, discs bigint, episodes bigint, "region 1" text, "region 2" text, "region 4" text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify all rows with 1 disc and 4 episodes, and inspect their Region 1 dates:
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 1" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs = 1 AND episodes = 4;
Results (volume, discs, episodes, region 1):
- 1, 1, 4, january 31 , 2006
- 2, 1, 4, march 28 , 2006
- 3, 1, 4, may 30 , 2006
- 4, 1, 4, july 18 , 2006
- 5, 1, 4, september 19 , 2006

2) Directly check which volume matches discs = 1, episodes = 4, and Region 1 = 'may 30 , 2006':
SQL executed:
SELECT volume FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs = 1 AND episodes = 4 AND "region 1" = 'may 30 , 2006';
Result: volume = 3

Assessment:
- A row with 1 disc, 4 episodes, and Region 1 date of “may 30 , 2006” does exist.
- The corresponding volume is 3, not 5.

Conclusion: The claim that this record corresponds to “volume 5” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “region 1” in the claim refers to the "region 1" text column in public.my_info_table.
- The date string comparison uses the exact formatting present in the table (lowercase month and spacing as shown).
