Evidence from available data:
- Data source: TabFact (public.joachim_hansen_fighter)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time, location, res
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE lower(opponent) = 'shinya aoki' OR event ILIKE '%DREAM 11%';

Results (relevant row):
- opponent: shinya aoki
  event: dream 11
  method: submission (armbar)
  round: 2
  time: 4:56
  location: yokohama , japan
  res: loss

Assessment:
- The dataset records that at DREAM 11, Joachim Hansen fought Shinya Aoki and lost by submission (armbar) at 4:56 of Round 2. This directly supports the notion that “go to 4:56” is the key timestamp of the fight’s conclusion.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “his fight” refers to Joachim Hansen (the available table is specifically about Joachim Hansen’s fights).
- “go to 4:56” refers to the official bout end time (i.e., the timestamp in the round when the finish occurred).
