Claim to verify: “3 - 0 be the 2nd leg when San Pedro be the 2nd place winner.”

Interpretation I verify: Whether there exists a Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty final in which (a) San Pedro were the runners-up (i.e., second place), and (b) the second leg score in that final was 3 - 0.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
- Relevant columns: year, winner, runners - up, 1st leg, 2nd leg, aggregate

Evidence
1) Verify column names (to correctly reference fields with spaces/hyphens):
SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty';
Result: ["year", "winner", "runners - up", "aggregate", "1st leg", "2nd leg"]

2) Check whether any row has runners-up containing “San Pedro” (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty WHERE "runners - up" ILIKE '%San Pedro%';
Result: {cnt: 0}
Interpretation: There are no finals where San Pedro are recorded as runners-up.

3) Find any rows mentioning “San Pedro” in either winner or runners-up, and show the legs:
SQL:
SELECT "year", winner, "runners - up", "1st leg", "2nd leg", aggregate
FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
WHERE winner ILIKE '%San Pedro%' OR "runners - up" ILIKE '%San Pedro%';
Result:
- year: 1984; winner: san pedro; runners - up: rocha; 1st leg: 1 - 3; 2nd leg: 3 - 0; aggregate: 4 - 3
Interpretation: San Pedro appears as the winner (not the runner-up) in 1984. In that tie, the second leg was 3 - 0.

Conclusion
- The scoreline “3 - 0” as the second leg did occur, but in the only instance where San Pedro appears in this dataset (1984), San Pedro were the winner, not the runner-up. There are no entries where San Pedro were runners-up.
- Therefore, the specific claim that “3 - 0 [was] the 2nd leg when San Pedro [were] the 2nd place winner” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “2nd place winner” is interpreted as “runner-up”.
- Case-insensitive string matching was used to capture any capitalization variants of “San Pedro”.
- Verification is limited to the available table (public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty) in the exposed TabFact database.
