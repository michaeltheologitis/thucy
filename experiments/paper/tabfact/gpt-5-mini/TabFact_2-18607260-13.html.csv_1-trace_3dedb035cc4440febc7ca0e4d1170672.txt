Conclusion based on evidence:
- The table documents exactly 4 World Cup matches occurring in June 1998, and each listed venue is in France. Therefore, within the scope of this dataset (1998 Paraguayan football matches), the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "the world cup have 4 game throughout june 1998 , all of which be in france" as referring to the World Cup matches represented in this table (i.e., Paraguay’s 1998 World Cup fixtures), not the entire tournament schedule.
- Used date LIKE '1998 - 06 - %' to identify June 1998 given the text-based date format.
- Used venue ILIKE '%france%' to determine that venues are in France.
