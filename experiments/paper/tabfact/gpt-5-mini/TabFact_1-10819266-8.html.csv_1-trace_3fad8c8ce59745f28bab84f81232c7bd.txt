Claim to verify: "september 22 , 2004 season premier have a rank of 21"

Data source explored: postgres_tabfact34 (TabFact) → public.csi_franchise
- Columns: season, episodes, time slot (est), season premiere, season finale, tv season, rank, viewers (in millions)

Method and evidence:
1) Identify how the season premiere date is stored in the table and confirm presence of the 2004 date
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "season premiere"
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE "season premiere" ILIKE '%September%'
AND "season premiere" ILIKE '%2004%';

2) Retrieve the row for the season with that premiere date and check its rank
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "season premiere", rank, "tv season", "viewers (in millions)"
FROM public.csi_franchise
WHERE lower("season premiere") = 'september 22 , 2004';

Result returned by query 2:
- season: 1
- season premiere: september 22 , 2004
- rank: 21
- tv season: 2004 - 2005
- viewers (in millions): 13.59

Conclusion:
- The table contains a season with a season premiere on "september 22 , 2004" and that season’s rank is 21. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the season-level “rank” field in the csi_franchise table, which represents the season’s ranking for the corresponding TV season.
- The date string match used case normalization and the table stores the date as "september 22 , 2004" (lowercase and with a space before the comma).
