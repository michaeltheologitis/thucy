Claim interpreted: The user is asking whether the episode titled “Aaliyah” was the first episode to air (within the available dataset of episodes).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_all_that_episodes with columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), episode title (text), original air date (text), nick prod (bigint).

Evidence 1: Find the episode titled “Aaliyah” and its air date
SQL executed:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%Aaliyah%'
ORDER BY "original air date" ASC;

Result:
- season: 16; series: 53; episode title: aaliyah; original air date: october 4 , 1997

Evidence 2: Determine the earliest episode air date in the dataset and compare to “Aaliyah”
SQL executed (Top 5 earliest episodes by parsed date):
WITH t AS (
  SELECT *, replace(initcap(trim("original air date")), ' ,', ',') AS norm
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
)
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date",
 CASE
  WHEN norm ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{1,2}, [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')
  WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')
  WHEN norm ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMMonth YYYY')
  WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'YYYY')
  WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$' THEN norm::date
  ELSE NULL
 END AS parsed_date
FROM t
ORDER BY parsed_date NULLS LAST, "original air date"
LIMIT 5;

Top results returned (earliest first):
1) season: 1; series: 38; episode title: tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j; original air date: november 16 , 1996; parsed_date: 1996-11-16
2) season: 2; series: 39; episode title: montell jordan; original air date: november 23 , 1996; parsed_date: 1996-11-23
3) season: 4; series: 41; episode title: dru hill; original air date: december 7 , 1996; parsed_date: 1996-12-07
4) season: 5; series: 42; episode title: tyra banks / blackstreet; original air date: december 14 , 1996; parsed_date: 1996-12-14
5) season: 6; series: 43; episode title: music special; original air date: december 17 , 1996; parsed_date: 1996-12-17

SQL executed (direct comparison of earliest date vs the “aaliyah” episode):
WITH t AS (
  SELECT *, replace(initcap(trim("original air date")), ' ,', ',') AS norm
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
), p AS (
  SELECT *,
   CASE
    WHEN norm ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{1,2}, [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')
    WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY')
    WHEN norm ~ '^[A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'FMMonth YYYY')
    WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{4}$' THEN to_date(norm,'YYYY')
    WHEN norm ~ '^[0-9]{4}-[0-9]{2}-[0-9]{2}$' THEN norm::date
    ELSE NULL
   END AS parsed_date
  FROM t
)
SELECT (SELECT min(parsed_date) FROM p) AS earliest_overall,
       (SELECT parsed_date FROM p WHERE lower("episode title") LIKE 'aaliyah' LIMIT 1) AS aaliyah_exact,
       (SELECT parsed_date FROM p WHERE lower("episode title") LIKE 'aaliyah%' LIMIT 1) AS aaliyah_like;

Result:
earliest_overall: 1996-11-16
aaliyah_exact: 1997-10-04
aaliyah_like: 1997-10-04

Conclusion
- The episode titled “aaliyah” aired on 1997-10-04.
- The earliest episode in this dataset aired on 1996-11-16, which is earlier than 1997-10-04.
- Therefore, the episode called “Aaliyah” was not the first episode to air (within the scope of the available data).

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as: “Was the episode titled ‘Aaliyah’ the first episode to air in the dataset?”
- Trusted the available TabFact dataset (public.list_of_all_that_episodes) as authoritative for this verification.
- Parsed textual dates into dates using standard patterns; results showed consistent, valid parsing for the compared entries.
