Claim interpreted: “The last record for both the highest totalling name and the lowest totalling name is in the month of September.” We interpret “last record” as the value in the column last and “highest/lowest totalling name” as the name(s) associated with the maximum/minimum value in total.

What the data shows
- Highest total:
  - Max total = 34
  - Name: kotonishiki — last: “september 1999” → September (matches claim)
- Lowest total (ties at 22):
  - daikirin — last: “september 1970” → September (matches claim)
  - kisenosato — last: “september 2011” → September (matches claim)
  - tochiazuma ii — last: “january 2005” → Not September (contradicts claim)

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Identify max and min totals
SELECT MAX(total) AS max_total, MIN(total) AS min_total FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
Returned: {"max_total":34, "min_total":22}

2) Retrieve rows for max total
SELECT name, total, first, last, "highest rank" FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE total = 34;
Returned: [{"name":"kotonishiki","total":34,"first":"september 1990","last":"september 1999","highest rank":"sekiwake"}]

3) Retrieve rows for min total (ties included)
SELECT name, total, first, last, "highest rank" FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE total = 22;
Returned: [{"name":"daikirin","total":22,"first":"november 1966","last":"september 1970","highest rank":"ōzeki"},{"name":"tochiazuma ii","total":22,"first":"july 1997","last":"january 2005","highest rank":"ōzeki"},{"name":"kisenosato","total":22,"first":"july 2006","last":"september 2011","highest rank":"ōzeki"}]

4) Explicit month check for September
SELECT name, total, last, (last ILIKE '%september%') AS last_is_september
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE total IN (34, 22)
ORDER BY total DESC, name;
Returned rows:
{"name":"kotonishiki","total":34,"last":"september 1999","last_is_september":true}
{"name":"daikirin","total":22,"last":"september 1970","last_is_september":true}
{"name":"kisenosato","total":22,"last":"september 2011","last_is_september":true}
{"name":"tochiazuma ii","total":22,"last":"january 2005","last_is_september":false}

Conclusion
- True for the highest total (kotonishiki: last is in September).
- Not uniformly true for the lowest total because there are multiple lowest-total names; one of them (tochiazuma ii) has last in January, not September.

Assumptions
- “Last record” refers to the last column in the table.
- “Highest/lowest totalling name” refers to the name(s) associated with the maximum/minimum values in total; in the presence of ties, all tied names are considered.
