Claim to verify: "iraq have a gdp (ppp) (billions usd) on 127348 in 2011"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact connector), public schema.
- Identified table: public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp with a column named "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd".

Evidence gathered:
- Query target: Iraq’s 2011 GDP (PPP), billions USD.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE lower(country) LIKE '%iraq%';

Result:
- Iraq — 127.348 (2011 GDP (PPP), billions USD)

Conclusion:
- The authoritative dataset reports Iraq’s 2011 GDP (PPP) as 127.348 billion USD. Interpreting the claim’s figure “127348” as a formatting variant of 127.348 (i.e., missing decimal/thousand separators) makes it consistent with the data. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence, assuming the intent was 127.348 billion USD.
- Note: If the figure “127348” were taken literally as 127,348 billions USD (i.e., 127.348 trillion), it would be incorrect. The data clearly supports 127.348 billions USD.

Assumptions made:
- The number "127348" in the claim is a formatting variant of 127.348 (billions USD), consistent with the dataset’s value.
