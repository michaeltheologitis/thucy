Claim interpreted: “1416 is the second-highest number of votes per candidate.” In the available dataset, the relevant field is “average votes per candidate” for Green Party of England and Wales election results by year.

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Table: public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results
  Columns include: year (text), candidates (bigint), "total votes" (bigint), "average votes per candidate" (bigint), "% of total vote" (double precision), "average % of vote per candidate" (double precision), "saved deposits" (bigint), "number of mps" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct values of “average votes per candidate” with associated years, sorted descending
SQL:
SELECT "average votes per candidate", array_agg(year ORDER BY year) AS years
FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results
GROUP BY "average votes per candidate"
ORDER BY "average votes per candidate" DESC;
Result (average votes per candidate -> years):
- 1416 -> ["2005"]
- 1148 -> ["2001"]
- 763  -> ["1974 - 02"]
- 753  -> ["1979"]
- 694  -> ["1997"]
- 675  -> ["1987"]
- 672  -> ["1992"]
- 498  -> ["1983"]
- 399  -> ["1974 - 10"]

2) Top two distinct “average votes per candidate” values
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "average votes per candidate" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE "average votes per candidate" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "average votes per candidate" DESC LIMIT 2;
Result:
[{"average votes per candidate":1416},{"average votes per candidate":1148}]

3) Year(s) for the second-highest distinct value (1148)
SQL:
SELECT year, candidates, "average votes per candidate" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE "average votes per candidate" = 1148;
Result:
[{"average votes per candidate":1148,"candidates":145,"year":"2001"}]

Conclusion:
- The highest average votes per candidate is 1416 (year 2005).
- The second-highest distinct average votes per candidate is 1148 (year 2001).
- Therefore, the claim that “1416 is the second highest number of vote per candidate” is not supported by the data; 1416 is the highest, not the second highest.

Assumptions made:
- “number of vote per candidate” refers to the column “average votes per candidate”.
- “second highest” is interpreted as the second-highest distinct value across years.
