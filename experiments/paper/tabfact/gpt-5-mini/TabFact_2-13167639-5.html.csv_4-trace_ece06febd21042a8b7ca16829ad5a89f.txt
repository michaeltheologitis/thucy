Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify how semifinal legs are labeled in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT "round", COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
GROUP BY "round"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, "round";
Result:
- final: 1
- round 3: 1
- round 4: 1
- round 5: 1
- semi - final first leg: 1
- semi - final second leg: 1
Interpretation:
- There is exactly one row labeled "semi - final first leg".

2) Retrieve the semifinal first leg match details
SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "result f - a", attendance
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE round = 'semi - final first leg';
Result:
- Date: 7 january 2003
- Opponents: blackburn rovers
