Summary conclusion: In the available 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats game-log data, Raymond Felton led (or co-led) the team in assists in 4 different games. Therefore, the claim that he led the team in assists fewer than 4 times is not supported by the data.

Data source discovery
- Used the available database discovery and schema inspection tools.
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season with columns including "high assists" (text), which lists the game’s team assist leader(s).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to understand the "high assists" format
- SQL:
  SELECT game, date, score, "high assists" FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt (relevant to Felton):
  - game=49 | date=february 6  | high assists=raymond felton (7)
  - game=50 | date=february 9  | high assists=raymond felton (5)
  - game=55 | date=february 22 | high assists=boris diaw , raymond felton (9) [tie]
  - game=56 | date=february 24 | high assists=raymond felton (5)

2) Count all games in the table where Felton is a high-assist leader (including ties)
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%felton%';
- Result: 4

- SQL (list):
  SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%felton%' ORDER BY game;
- Results:
  1) game: 49, date: february 6, high assists: raymond felton (7)
  2) game: 50, date: february 9, high assists: raymond felton (5)
  3) game: 55, date: february 22, high assists: boris diaw , raymond felton (9) [tie]
  4) game: 56, date: february 24, high assists: raymond felton (5)

Assessment

- The claim states "less than 4 different time"; the data show exactly 4, which contradicts the claim.

Assumptions made
