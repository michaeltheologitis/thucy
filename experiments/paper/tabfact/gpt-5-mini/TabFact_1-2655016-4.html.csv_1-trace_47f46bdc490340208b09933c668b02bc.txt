Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single episodes-related table: public.list_of_all_that_episodes in the postgres_tabfact16 (TabFact) database.
- Inspected schema to find the episode title column ("episode title").
- Queried the table to count titles beginning with the letter T (case-insensitive), trimming leading whitespace to avoid false negatives. Also listed the matching episodes for transparency.

Data source and schema
- Database: postgres_tabfact16 (schema: public)
- Table: public.list_of_all_that_episodes
- Columns:
  - season (bigint)
  - series (bigint)
  - "episode title" (text)
  - "original air date" (text)
  - nick prod (bigint)

Evidence 1: Count titles beginning with letter T (case-insensitive)
- Result: 3
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_t_titles
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE trim(leading FROM "episode title") ILIKE 'T%';

Evidence 2: List the matching episodes
- Results (season, series, episode title):
  1) season 1, series 38 — "tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j"
  2) season 5, series 42 — "tyra banks / blackstreet"
  3) season 9, series 46 — "tony! toni! tone!"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, series, "episode title"
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE ltrim("episode title") ILIKE 'T%'
  ORDER BY season, series, "episode title";

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 3 episodes whose titles begin with the letter T (case-insensitive).

Assumptions
- "Begin with the letter t" interpreted case-insensitively (i.e., 't' or 'T').
- Leading whitespace is ignored when determining the first letter.
- Each row represents a distinct episode entry in the dataset.
