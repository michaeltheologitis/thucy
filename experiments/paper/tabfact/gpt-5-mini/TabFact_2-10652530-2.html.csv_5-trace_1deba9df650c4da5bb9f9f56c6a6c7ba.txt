- postgres_tabfact17 (schema: public) with table public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season (2004 Cleveland Browns season)

Relevant schema

Evidence step 2: Identify the Browns game on October 17, 2004 and its opponent/attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season
WHERE (date ILIKE '%October%' OR date ILIKE '%Oct%') AND date ILIKE '%17%';
Result:
- Week: 6 | Date: october 17 , 2004 | Opponent: cincinnati bengals | Attendance: 73,263

Assessment of the claim
- Claimed: “the game on october 17 , 2004 , against the opponent san diego charger , have 73263 in attendance.”
- Findings:
  - On October 17, 2004, the Browns’ opponent was the Cincinnati Bengals, not the San Diego Chargers. Attendance was 73,263 on that date.
  - The Browns did play the San Diego Chargers on December 19, 2004, with an attendance of 72,489—not 73,263.

Conclusion
- The attendance figure 73,263 matches the Browns’ October 17, 2004 game, but the opponent is incorrect. Therefore, the claim mixes correct and incorrect information.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the context of the 2004 Cleveland Browns season (the only available data source). The opponent string “san diego charger” was treated as “San Diego Chargers.”
