Claim interpreted: “New Jersey be the visiting team on February 27 against Buffalo.” This asks whether New Jersey played as the visitor versus Buffalo on February 27 (year unspecified).

Data source check
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26), schema public.
- Relevant table: my_info_table(date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text).

Evidence
1) Direct lookup for a Feb 27 game with New Jersey as visitor and Buffalo as home
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM public.my_info_table WHERE (date ILIKE '%February 27%' OR date ILIKE '%Feb 27%') AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' AND home ILIKE '%Buffalo%';
- Result:
Date: february 27; Visitor: new jersey; Home: buffalo; Score: 2 - 6

2) Cross-check: list all Feb 27 games involving New Jersey or Buffalo
- Executed SQL (sanity check on date values):
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM my_info_table WHERE date LIKE '%27%';
- Result: [{"date":"february 27"}]

- Executed SQL (games on that exact date involving either team):
SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM my_info_table WHERE date = 'february 27' AND (visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' OR home ILIKE '%New Jersey%' OR visitor ILIKE '%Buffalo%' OR home ILIKE '%Buffalo%');
- Result: [{"date":"february 27","home":"buffalo","score":"2 - 6","visitor":"new jersey"}]

Conclusion
- The database shows a game on “february 27” where New Jersey is the visiting team and Buffalo is the home team. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “New Jersey” refers to the New Jersey team listed in the dataset (commonly the Devils in NHL context) and “Buffalo” to the Buffalo team (commonly the Sabres). The dataset stores team names and dates as lowercase text without a year; the claim does not specify a year, so verification is based on the available record for “february 27.”
