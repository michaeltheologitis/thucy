Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and inspected its schema to locate relevant tables/fields.
- Queried the chinese_units_of_measurement table for the characters 厘 and 分 to retrieve their imperial values.

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement
  - Columns: jyutping (text), character (text), portuguese (text), relative value (text), metric value (text), imperial value (text)

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "imperial value", "metric value", portuguese
  FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
  WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');

- Results returned by the database:
  • character: 厘; jyutping: lei4; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr; relative value: 1 / 1600; metric value: 37.79931 mg; portuguese: liz
  • character: 分; jyutping: fan1; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr; relative value: 1 / 1600; metric value: 377.9936375 mg; portuguese: condorim

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 be ~0.2133 dr.”
- Finding: The imperial value field for both 厘 and 分 in the authoritative table is exactly “~0.2133 dr.”
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Notes
- The table lists the same imperial and relative values for both units, while the metric values differ. This discrepancy does not affect verification of the specific claim about imperial values.

Assumptions
- “dr” as shown in the table is accepted as the intended imperial unit label for dram, and the table’s values are authoritative.
- Matching was done on exact characters ‘厘’ and ‘分’.
