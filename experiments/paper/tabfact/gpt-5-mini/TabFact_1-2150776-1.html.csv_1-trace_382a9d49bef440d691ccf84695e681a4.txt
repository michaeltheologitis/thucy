Claim to verify: "on june 8 , 1997 , jeff gordon drive for 200 lap"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact12 (TabFact). Within schema public, a relevant table was identified: public.pocono_400, which contains columns year, date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, race time, average speed (mph), and report.

Evidence gathered (executed SQL and results):
1) SQL executed:
SELECT date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, "average speed (mph)", report
FROM public.pocono_400
WHERE year = 1997;

Result (1 row):
- date: june 8
- driver: jeff gordon
- team: hendrick motorsports
- manufacturer: chevrolet
- laps: 200
- average speed (mph): 139.828
- report: report

Analysis:
- The table entry for year 1997 shows the event date as "june 8" with driver "jeff gordon" and the laps value as 200. This supports the claim that on June 8, 1997, Jeff Gordon drove a race of 200 laps (consistent with the Pocono 500’s 200-lap distance on a 2.5-mile track).

Conclusion:
- The data directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "drive for 200 lap" as the race distance completed by the winner being 200 laps on June 8, 1997, at Pocono, where Jeff Gordon is recorded in the dataset.
