Claim assessed: “The principal activity of EPCOR is airline.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.klm with columns including company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, and group 's equity shareholding.

Evidence gathered
1) Query to locate EPCOR and its principal activities
Executed SQL:
SELECT company, "principal activities" FROM klm WHERE company ILIKE 'EPCOR';
Result:
- company: epcor
- principal activities: maintenance

2) Full context for EPCOR
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.klm WHERE company ILIKE '%EPCOR%';
Result (columns: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, group 's equity shareholding):
- company: epcor
- type: subsidiary
- principal activities: maintenance
- incorporated in: netherlands
- group 's equity shareholding: 100%

Analysis
- The authoritative entry for EPCOR (stored as “epcor”) lists its principal activities as “maintenance,” not “airline.”
- Therefore, the claim that EPCOR’s principal activity is airline is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- EPCOR’s principal activity: maintenance.
- The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- “EPCOR” refers to the entity recorded in public.klm. A case-insensitive search (ILIKE) was used to match the company name.
- “Principal activity” is interpreted as the value in the "principal activities" column of the klm table.
