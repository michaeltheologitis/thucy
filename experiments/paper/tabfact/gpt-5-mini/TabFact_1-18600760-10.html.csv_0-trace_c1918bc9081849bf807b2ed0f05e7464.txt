Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a relevant table: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota in a PostgreSQL database (TabFact).
- Inspected the table schema to confirm presence of water area (in square miles) and a geographic identifier column (geo id).
- Queried the table directly by the provided geo id and by township name to verify both parts of the claim.

Data source discovery
- Accessible data sources found: one PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota.

Schema inspection
- Table: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
- Columns (relevant):
  - township (text)
  - county (text)
  - water (sqmi) (double precision)
  - land ( sqmi ) (double precision)
  - geo id (bigint)
- No primary key or constraints.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify by geo id
SQL executed:
SELECT township, county, "water (sqmi)" AS water_sqmi, "land ( sqmi )" AS land_sqmi
FROM list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE "geo id" = 3806741020;
Result:
- township: joliette
- county: pembina
- water area (sq mi): 0.771
- land area (sq mi): 70.044

2) Cross-check by township name
SQL executed:
SELECT township, "geo id", "water (sqmi)" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE lower(township) = 'joliette';
Result:
- township: joliette
- geo id: 3806741020
- water (sqmi): 0.771

Assessment of the claim
- “joliette have 0.771 square mile of water”: Supported. The water area is 0.771 sq mi for the Joliette township record.
- “and can be find with geo id 3806741020”: Supported. The record for Joliette has geo id = 3806741020.

Conclusion
- Both parts of the claim are fully supported by the queried data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “joliette” as the township in North Dakota (Pembina County), not the city in Quebec, due to the presence of a matching record in the North Dakota townships table and the geo id format consistent with a county subdivision GEOID in North Dakota.
