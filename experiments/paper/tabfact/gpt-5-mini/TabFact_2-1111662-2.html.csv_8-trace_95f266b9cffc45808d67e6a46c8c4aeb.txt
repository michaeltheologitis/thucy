Claim interpreted: Whether Milcah Chemos’s record time is more than 19:15.06.

Data source explored: postgres_tabfact4.public.memorial_van_damme

Evidence retrieved (exact SQL and results):
SQL:
SELECT event, record, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE athlete ILIKE 'Milcah Chemos';

Result:
- event: 3000 m steeplechase
- record: 9:15.06
- date: 6 september 2013

Analysis:
- Convert to seconds for comparison:
  • 9:15.06 = 555.06 seconds
  • 19:15.06 = 1155.06 seconds
- 555.06 < 1155.06, so Milcah Chemos’s record (9:15.06) is not more than 19:15.06.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data in the available source.

Assumptions:
- "Record" refers to the record listed for Milcah Chemos in the memorial_van_damme dataset (3000 m steeplechase meet record), and “more than” is interpreted as a numerically larger time (i.e., longer duration).
