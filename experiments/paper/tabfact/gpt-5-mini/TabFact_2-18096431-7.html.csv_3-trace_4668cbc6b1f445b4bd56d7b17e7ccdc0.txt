Claim being checked: "frank nobilo be the only player from new zealand"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered one accessible database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact), schema public, containing table t_1996_pga_championship.
- Table columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text), money (bigint).

Evidence from data:
1) Distinct New Zealand players
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT player, country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(country) = 'new zealand' ORDER BY player;
Result:
- player: frank nobilo | country: new zealand

2) Count of distinct players from New Zealand
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS nz_player_count FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(country) = 'new zealand';
Result:
- nz_player_count: 1

3) Broad check for any country values containing 'zealand'
SQL executed:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%zealand%';
Result rows (1):
- place: t8 | player: frank nobilo | country: new zealand | score: 69 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 280 | to par: - 8 | money: 57500

4) Distinct countries present (to confirm how New Zealand is represented)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY country ASC;
Result (distinct country values): australia; fiji; new zealand; sweden; united states; zimbabwe

Conclusion:
- Within the t_1996_pga_championship dataset, Frank Nobilo is the only player whose country is listed as New Zealand. All queries above support this.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1996 PGA Championship dataset represented by table t_1996_pga_championship. The phrase "only player from New Zealand" is interpreted as "the only player whose country is recorded as New Zealand in this table."
