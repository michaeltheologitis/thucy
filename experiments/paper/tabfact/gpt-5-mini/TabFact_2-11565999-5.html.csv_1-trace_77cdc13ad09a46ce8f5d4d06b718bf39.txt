Claim: “track 23 have a title: just a little bit.”

Data discovery and context:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table discovered: public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters with columns:
  - track (bigint)
  - recorded (text)
  - original issue (text)
  - song title (text)
  - time (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve the title for track 23
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT track, "song title" FROM public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters WHERE track = 23;
- Result: track = 23, song title = "he'll have to go".

2) Check if track 23’s title matches “just a little bit” (case-insensitive, trimmed)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "track", "song title", (lower(trim("song title")) = 'just a little bit') AS matches_just_a_little_bit FROM public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters WHERE track = 23;
- Result: track = 23, song title = "he'll have to go", matches_just_a_little_bit = false.

3) Identify if any track has the title “just a little bit”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT track, "song title" FROM public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters WHERE LOWER("song title") = 'just a little bit';
- Result: track = 9, song title = "just a little bit".

Conclusion:
- Track 23’s title is “he'll have to go”, not “just a little bit”. The title “just a little bit” exists in this dataset but corresponds to track 9. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Title” refers to the column "song title" in the table public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters.
- The “track” column encodes the track number uniquely within this table.
- The table represents the authoritative listing for the relevant album context implied by the query.
