Claim to verify: "the soviet union receive 6 more medal than east germany in the total medal count"

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL TabFact instance (postgres_tabfact9), public schema.
- Relevant table found: t_1988_winter_olympics with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total.

Evidence from data
1) List of nations and totals to identify USSR and East Germany entries
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics ORDER BY total DESC, nation ASC;
Result (excerpt):
- soviet union (urs) — 29
- east germany (gdr) — 25

2) Focused lookup and explicit difference calculation
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Soviet%' OR nation ILIKE '%East%' OR nation ILIKE '%German%';
Result:
- soviet union (urs): gold=11, silver=9, bronze=9, total=29
- east germany (gdr): gold=9, silver=10, bronze=6, total=25
- west germany (frg): gold=2, silver=4, bronze=2, total=8

SQL executed:
SELECT 
 (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation = 'soviet union (urs)') AS ussr_total,
 (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation = 'east germany (gdr)') AS gdr_total,
 ( (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation = 'soviet union (urs)') - (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation = 'east germany (gdr)') ) AS difference;
Result:
- ussr_total = 29, gdr_total = 25, difference = 4

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (1988 Winter Olympics), the Soviet Union earned 4 more total medals than East Germany, not 6. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence we have.

Assumptions and scope
- The only accessible, relevant dataset concerns the 1988 Winter Olympics. I interpreted “total medal count” as the total medals at that edition. If a different Games or an all-time total was intended, that context is not present in the available data; within this data, the claim is incorrect.
