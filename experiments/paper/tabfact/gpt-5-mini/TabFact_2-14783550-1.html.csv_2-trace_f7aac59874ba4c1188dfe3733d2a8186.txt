Overview of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (schema: public) containing a table relevant to the claim: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games.

Schema details used
- Table: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
  - Columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)
  - No primary/foreign keys.

Evidence collected
1) Search for Singapore and Mongolia entries (case-insensitive substring match)
Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Sing%'
   OR nation ILIKE '%Mong%';

Results:
- nation: singapore (sin) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 5, total: 5
- nation: mongolia (mgl) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 3, total: 3

2) Confirm using exact nation labels
Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games WHERE nation IN ('singapore (sin)', 'mongolia (mgl)');

Results:
- nation: singapore (sin) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 5, total: 5
- nation: mongolia (mgl) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 3, total: 3

Interpretation
- The authoritative table summarizing Wushu medals at the Asian Games shows that both Singapore and Mongolia have 0 gold medals in Wushu. Therefore, the claim that neither Singapore nor Mongolia has won a Wushu gold medal at the Asian Games is supported by the data available.

Assumptions
- The table public.wushu_at_the_asian_games represents aggregate Asian Games Wushu medal totals by nation up to the dataset’s coverage.
- Nation labels “singapore (sin)” and “mongolia (mgl)” correspond to Singapore and Mongolia, respectively.
