Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and inspected its schema to locate relevant tables.
- Queried the chinese_units_of_measurement table to retrieve the entries for 斤 and 担 / 擔 and examined their relative value field.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement
- Columns: jyutping (text), character (text), portuguese (text), relative value (text), metric value (text), imperial value (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial check for exact characters 斤, 担, 擔
SQL:
SELECT character, jyutping, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value"
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character IN ('斤', '担', '擔');
Result:
- character: 斤; jyutping: gan1; portuguese: cate; relative value: 1; metric value: 604.78982 g; imperial value: ~1.3333lb
- No rows for exact '担' or '擔' (indicates they may be recorded under a combined form or variant).

2) Search for rows related to 担/擔 or dan by substring/romanization
SQL:
SELECT character, jyutping, portuguese, "relative value"
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character LIKE '%担%' OR character LIKE '%擔%' OR jyutping ILIKE '%dan%' OR portuguese ILIKE '%dan%';
Result:
- character: 担 / 擔; jyutping: daam3; portuguese: pico; relative value: 100

3) Exact retrieval of the combined 担 / 擔 row
SQL:
SELECT jyutping, character, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character = '担 / 擔';
Result:
- character: 担 / 擔; jyutping: daam3; portuguese: pico; relative value: 100; metric value: 60.478982 kg; imperial value: ~133.3333lb

Conclusion
- 斤 has relative value = 1.
- 担 / 擔 has relative value = 100.
- Both relative values are >= 1, so the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “relative value” to refer to the "relative value" column in public.chinese_units_of_measurement.
- Treated 担 / 擔 (combined entry) as the canonical record for this unit, since individual exact matches for '担' or '擔' were not present.
