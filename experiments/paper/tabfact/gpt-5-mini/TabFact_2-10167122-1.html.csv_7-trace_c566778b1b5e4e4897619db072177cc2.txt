Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single relevant table: public.brian_watts.
- Inspected the schema and confirmed the presence of an aggregate “cuts made” column by tournament.
- Queried the cuts-made counts for the PGA Championship and the U.S. Open and computed their difference.

Evidence from the database
1) Inspect available tournament names (to ensure exact matching)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM brian_watts ORDER BY tournament;
Result:
[{"tournament":"masters tournament"},{"tournament":"pga championship"},{"tournament":"the open championship"},{"tournament":"totals"},{"tournament":"us open"}]

2) Retrieve cuts made for PGA Championship and U.S. Open
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "cuts made" FROM brian_watts WHERE tournament IN ('pga championship', 'us open') ORDER BY tournament;
Result:
[{"cuts made":4,"tournament":"pga championship"},{"cuts made":1,"tournament":"us open"}]

3) Compute the difference (PGA Championship minus U.S. Open)
SQL executed:
SELECT ( (SELECT "cuts made" FROM brian_watts WHERE tournament='pga championship') - (SELECT "cuts made" FROM brian_watts WHERE tournament='us open') ) AS difference;
Result:
[{"difference":3}]

Finding
- PGA Championship cuts made: 4
- U.S. Open cuts made: 1
- Difference: PGA Championship has 3 more cuts made than the U.S. Open.

Conclusion
The claim that “the PGA Championship, Brian Watt has 3 fewer cuts made than in the U.S. Open” is contradicted by the data. The data show the opposite: he has 3 more cuts made in the PGA Championship than in the U.S. Open.

Assumptions
- “Brian Watt” refers to the golfer Brian Watts represented by the table public.brian_watts.
- Tournament names in the database are stored in lowercase (e.g., “pga championship”, “us open”), and the aggregate “cuts made” column represents total cuts made for each tournament across his career.
