Claim to verify: "no episode of gary unmarried air in december 2009"

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.gary_unmarried
  - Columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision)

Approach:
1) Inspect all episodes and air dates to understand formatting.
2) Search specifically for any episodes with air dates in December 2009.
3) Cross-check with counts for December 2009 and compare against December 2008 (observed in the data) to validate the pattern and ensure search efficacy.

Evidence and executed SQL:
A) Inspect all episodes and their air dates
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried ORDER BY episode;
Result highlights (examples): shows multiple 2009 entries (Jan–May 2009) and two December 2008 entries ("december 10 , 2008"; "december 17 , 2008"); no December 2009 dates appear.

B) Direct search for December 2009 rows
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" LIKE '%2009%' AND ("air date" ILIKE '%dec%' OR "air date" LIKE '%-12-%' OR "air date" LIKE '%/12/%' OR "air date" LIKE '%2009-12%' OR "air date" LIKE '%12/%/2009%') ORDER BY episode;
Rows returned: none.

C) Count episodes in December 2009
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS dec_2009_count FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE LOWER("air date") LIKE '%dec%' AND "air date" LIKE '%2009%';
Result: dec_2009_count = 0

D) Count episodes in December 2008 (comparison)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS dec_2008_count FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE LOWER("air date") LIKE '%dec%' AND "air date" LIKE '%2008%';
Result: dec_2008_count = 2

E) List the December 2008 rows (to validate December formatting in this dataset)
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot, "18 - 49", viewers FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE LOWER("air date") LIKE '%dec%' AND "air date" LIKE '%2008%' ORDER BY "air date";
Results:
- gary goes first — december 10 , 2008 — wednesday 8:30 pm — 2.4 / 7 — 8.03
- gary toughens up tom — december 17 , 2008 — wednesday 8:30 pm — 2.3 / 7 — 7.55

Finding:
- Across all queries, there are zero episodes in the table with an air date in December 2009. December entries exist for 2008, confirming the month naming format and that our pattern matching works on this dataset.

Conclusion:
- The claim "no episode of gary unmarried air in december 2009" is supported by the available data: there are 0 such episodes in December 2009 in public.gary_unmarried.
