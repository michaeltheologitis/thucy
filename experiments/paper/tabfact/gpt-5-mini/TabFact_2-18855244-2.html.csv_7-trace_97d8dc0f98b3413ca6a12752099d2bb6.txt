Claim: “robert garrett and james connolly both represent different country.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16), schema: public.
- Relevant table: list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (columns: medal count, date, athlete, nation, sport, record medal event).

Evidence gathered:
1) SQL executed (broad, case-insensitive match):
SELECT athlete, nation FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Robert Garrett%' OR athlete ILIKE '%James Connolly%';
Results:
- {"athlete":"james connolly","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"james connolly","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett","nation":"united states"}

2) SQL executed (deduplicated athlete→nation pairs):
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, nation FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Robert Garrett%' OR athlete ILIKE '%James Connolly%';
Results:
- {"athlete":"james connolly","nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett","nation":"united states"}

Conclusion:
- Both Robert Garrett and James Connolly are listed with nation = “united states” in the authoritative multiple Olympic medalists table. Therefore, they did not represent different countries in the context of Olympic results captured by this dataset.

Assumptions made:
- “Represent different country” is interpreted as their Olympic nation affiliation.
- Case-insensitive matching was used to locate athlete names stored in lowercase.
- The TabFact list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists table is treated as authoritative for athlete→nation mappings.
