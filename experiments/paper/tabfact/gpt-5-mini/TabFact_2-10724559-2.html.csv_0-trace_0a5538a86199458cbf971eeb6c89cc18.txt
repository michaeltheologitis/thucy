Summary
- I checked the available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.football_records_in_italy. This table contains columns for player name, debut year, goals, apps, and current club.

Evidence
1) Retrieve Diego Milito’s record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "debut year", goals, apps, "current club" FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name ILIKE '%Diego%Milito%';
- Result:
  name: diego milito
  debut year: 2008
  goals: 86
  apps: 145
  current club: inter

2) Verify uniqueness of the match
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name ILIKE '%Diego%Milito%';
- Result: 1 row matches

Assessment
- The table lists Diego Milito with debut year = 2008 and goals = 86. This directly supports the user’s claim as expressed.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data retrieved from public.football_records_in_italy.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “debut in 2008 and have 86 goal” to refer to the table’s columns “debut year” and “goals” for the player named Diego Milito.
- Used case-insensitive name matching (ILIKE) to find the player’s record in the dataset.
- Treated the TabFact dataset as authoritative for this verification task, as instructed.
