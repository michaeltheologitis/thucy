Claim being checked: “the New York Jets had 3 more wins than losses during the 1993 season.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered PostgreSQL database TabFact with table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season containing game-by-game results for the 1993 New York Jets season.

Evidence collected:
1) Distinct results and frequencies
SQL executed:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
GROUP BY result
ORDER BY count DESC, result;
Result (each appears once):
- l 16 - 14 — 1
- l 19 - 10 — 1
- l 24 - 0 — 1
- l 24 - 20 — 1
- l 26 - 20 — 1
- l 28 - 7 — 1
- l 35 - 30 — 1
- l 9 - 6 — 1
- w 10 - 6 — 1
- w 17 - 12 — 1
- w 24 - 14 — 1
- w 27 - 10 — 1
- w 3 - 0 — 1
- w 31 - 17 — 1
- w 45 - 7 — 1
- w 6 - 0 — 1
(16 distinct results; each appears once.)

2) Win/loss counts
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lower(result) LIKE 'w%') AS wins,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE lower(result) LIKE 'l%') AS losses
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
Result: wins = 8, losses = 8.

3) Total games confirmation
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
Result: total_games = 16.

Analysis:
- The table shows 8 wins and 8 losses, implying a 0 differential (not +3). No ties are present in this dataset.
- Therefore, the claim that the Jets had 3 more wins than losses in 1993 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “take 3 more win over loss” as “finished the season with 3 more wins than losses.”
- Classified results by the first character in the result field: values starting with 'w' as wins and 'l' as losses.
