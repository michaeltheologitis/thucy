Claim: “gohad have 36732 more electorate in 2009 than bhander.”

What I checked:
- Located a table of assembly segments under the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency with a column “number of electorates (2009)”. Queried the 2009 electorate counts for Gohad and Bhander and computed the difference.

Evidence from data:
1) Electorate counts (2009)
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name ILIKE '%gohad%' OR name ILIKE '%bhander%';
- Result:
  - Gohad: 166893
  - Bhander: 139600

2) Difference (Gohad minus Bhander)
- SQL:
  SELECT (SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name='gohad') - (SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name='bhander') AS difference;
- Result:
  - difference: 27293

Conclusion:
- The actual difference is 27,293, not 36,732. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Electorate in 2009” refers to the column “number of electorates (2009)” in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table.
- Constituency names were matched case-insensitively (records are stored as 'gohad' and 'bhander').
