Claim: "alberto pagani have only win with 2 team : linto and mv agusta"

Data sources explored
- Discovered data asset: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.alberto_pagani (columns: year, class, team, points, wins).

Schema details consulted
- Table: public.alberto_pagani
  - Columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all records to see per-season wins by team
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Key rows (year | class | team | points | wins):
- 1969 | 500cc | linto     | 15 | 1
- 1971 | 500cc | linto     | 29 | 1
- 1971 | 500cc | mv agusta | 29 | 1
- 1972 | 500cc | mv agusta | 87 | 1
All other rows for other teams (aermacchi, ducati, honda, kreidler, norton, paton, suzuki, derbi) show wins = 0.

2) Aggregate wins by team
SQL: SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY team ORDER BY total_wins DESC, team;
Result (team | total_wins):
- linto | 2
- mv agusta | 2
- aermacchi | 0
- derbi | 0
- ducati | 0
- honda | 0
- kreidler | 0
- norton | 0
- paton | 0
- suzuki | 0

3) Teams with any wins (> 0)
SQL: SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY team HAVING SUM(wins) > 0 ORDER BY total_wins DESC, team;
Result (team | total_wins):
- linto | 2
- mv agusta | 2

Conclusion
- The data show Alberto Pagani’s wins are recorded only with Linto and MV Agusta. All other teams in the dataset have zero wins for him. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "Wins" refers to Grand Prix race wins per season/class for Alberto Pagani, and the table comprehensively captures his GP seasons and wins.
