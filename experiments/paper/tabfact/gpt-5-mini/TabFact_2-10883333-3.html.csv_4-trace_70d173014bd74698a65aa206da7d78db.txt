Summary
- Claim: “the home team score be 14.18 (102) against the away team score of 14.14 (98).” Interpreted as a single match where the home side scored 14.18 (102) and the away side scored 14.14 (98).
- Data source consulted: TabFact database, table public.t_1975_vfl_season (VFL 1975 season results), which includes home/away teams and their scores as text.

What the data shows
1) Existence of any match with a team scoring 14.18 (102)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date"
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '14.18 (102)'
   OR "away team score" = '14.18 (102)';

Result (1 row):
- home team: carlton | home team score: 14.18 (102) | away team: north melbourne | away team score: 9.12 (66) | date: 19 april 1975

2) Existence of any match with a team scoring 14.14 (98)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date"
FROM t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '14.14 (98)'
   OR "away team score" = '14.14 (98)';

Result (1 row):
- home team: geelong | home team score: 13.12 (90) | away team: footscray | away team score: 14.14 (98) | date: 19 april 1975

3) Direct check for the claimed combination in one match
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '14.18 (102)'
  AND "away team score" = '14.14 (98)';

Result: cnt = 0 (no such match in the table)

4) Check for the reversed combination (home 14.14 (98), away 14.18 (102))
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "home team score" = '14.14 (98)' AND "away team score" = '14.18 (102)';

Result: count = 0

Conclusion
- Within the authoritative dataset available (VFL 1975 season in TabFact), there is no match where the home team scored 14.18 (102) and the away team scored 14.14 (98). While each individual scoreline appears in the season (in different matches on 19 April 1975), the exact combination in a single match does not occur.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible TabFact database table public.t_1975_vfl_season (VFL 1975 season). The claim may refer to another season or competition, but no such data is accessible here.
- Score comparisons were done as exact text matches (no normalization beyond the string provided).
