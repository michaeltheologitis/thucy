Claim to verify: “the party with 21 total member have 18 more member than the party with the fewest total member.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered PostgreSQL data source (TabFact), schema: public.
- Relevant table: members_of_the_5th_seanad with columns including party (text) and total (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the party with total = 21
SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE total = 21;
Result:
[{"party":"fianna fáil","total":21}]

2) Find the minimum total across all parties
SQL:
SELECT MIN(total) AS min_total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result:
[{"min_total":3}]

3) Identify the party (or parties) with that minimum total
SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE total = 3 ORDER BY party;
Result:
[{"party":"clann na talmhan","total":3}]

4) Compute the difference between the 21-member party and the minimum total
SQL:
SELECT m.party, m.total AS party_total, t.min_total, (m.total - t.min_total) AS difference
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad m
CROSS JOIN (SELECT MIN(total) AS min_total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad) t
WHERE m.total = 21;
Result:
[{"party":"fianna fáil","party_total":21,"min_total":3,"difference":18}]

Conclusion
- The party with 21 total members (fianna fáil) exceeds the fewest total members (3, clann na talmhan) by 18. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “party with 21 total member” as the row where total = 21 in members_of_the_5th_seanad.
- Interpreted “fewest total member” as the minimum of the total column within the same table (only one party has the minimum in the data).
