Claim interpreted: In 2011, the Ned Kelly Awards entry for the reader's vote is “n/a”.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact29 (public schema)
- Table: ned_kelly_awards
  - Columns: "year" (bigint), "best teenage / young adult" (text), "reader 's vote" (text), "best non - fiction" (text), "lifetime achievement" (text)

Evidence
1) Retrieve the reader's vote for 2011
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "year", "reader 's vote" FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE "year" = 2011;
- Result:
  { year: 2011, reader 's vote: "na" }

2) Confirm uniqueness of the 2011 row
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2011 FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE "year" = 2011;
- Result:
  count_2011 = 1

Assessment
- The table shows the 2011 reader's vote as "na". This is effectively the same as “n/a” (a common formatting variant indicating not applicable/available). No conflicting records exist for 2011.

Conclusion
- The claim that in 2011 the reader's vote was “n/a” is supported by the data, allowing for minor formatting differences (stored as "na").

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the "reader 's vote" column in the ned_kelly_awards table for the year 2011.
- Treated "na" and "n/a" as equivalent notations for “not applicable/available.”
