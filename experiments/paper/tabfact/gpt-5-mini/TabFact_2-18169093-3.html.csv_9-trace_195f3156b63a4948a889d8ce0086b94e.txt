What I checked
- I explored the available data sources and found a dedicated table for the 1981 Open Championship: public.t_1981_open_championship with columns (place, player, country, score, to par).

Evidence from the database
1) Full listing with tie counts per place
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", count(*) OVER (PARTITION BY place) AS players_sharing_place
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
ORDER BY place, player;

Key returned rows (16 total):
- t1: 2 players — nick job (England), vicente fernã¡ndez (Argentina)
- t3: 6 players — david graham (Australia), hal sutton (a) (United States), isao aoki (Japan), johnny miller (United States), simon owen (New Zealand), tony jacklin (England)
- t9: 8 players — arnold palmer (United States), ben crenshaw (United States), bill rogers (United States), david jagger (England), greg norman (Australia), howard clark (England), mark james (England), sam torrance (Scotland)
Interpretation: All places present in this table are ties. The top spot (t1) is shared by two players: one from England and one from Argentina.

2) Was Argentina’s position unique? Are any places uniquely held?
Executed SQL (Argentina entries and whether their place was unique):
SELECT t.place, t.player, t.country, t.score, t."to par", counts.cnt
FROM t_1981_open_championship t
JOIN (SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1981_open_championship GROUP BY place) counts USING (place)
WHERE t.country = 'argentina';

Result:
- place = t1, player = vicente fernã¡ndez, country = argentina, score = 70, to par = e, cnt = 2
Interpretation: Argentina’s entry (Vicente Fernández) shared first place (cnt = 2). Not unique.

Executed SQL (counts per place to detect any singleton places):
SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1981_open_championship GROUP BY place ORDER BY place;

Result:
- t1 → 2
- t3 → 6
- t9 → 8
Interpretation: There are no places with COUNT(*) = 1 in this table; every listed place is tied among multiple players.

Assessment of the claim
- "no 1 player achieve their position alone": True with respect to this table — the first place is tied (t1 with two players).
- "except argentina": False — the Argentine player (Vicente Fernández) did not hold first place alone; he tied with Nick Job (England).

Conclusion: The statement mixes one true part (first place was not held alone) with a false exception (Argentina did not uniquely hold a position here).

Assumptions made due to phrasing ambiguity
- I interpreted "no 1 player" as "No. 1 (first) place was not achieved by a single player" and "except Argentina" as claiming Argentina was the exception to that pattern. The underlying data table (public.t_1981_open_championship) lists the relevant positions and shows that all listed places, including first, were ties.
