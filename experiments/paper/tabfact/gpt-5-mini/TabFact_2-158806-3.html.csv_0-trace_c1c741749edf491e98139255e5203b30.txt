Claim to verify: “the diameter of the value 100 ₧ with an equiv of 0.60 be 24.5 mm.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.peseta (columns: value text, equiv text, diameter text, weight text, composition text)

Evidence from the data (with exact executed SQL and results)
1) Locate entries for 100 ₧ and check diameter
SQL: SELECT value, equiv, diameter FROM peseta WHERE value LIKE '%100%';
Result: [{"value":"100 ₧","equiv":"0.60","diameter":"24.5 mm"}]

2) Verify there are no alternate diameters for value containing 100
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT diameter FROM peseta WHERE value LIKE '%100%';
Result: [{"diameter":"24.5 mm"}]

3) Cross-check by exact equivalence value 0.60
SQL: SELECT value, equiv, diameter FROM peseta WHERE equiv = '0.60';
Result: [{"value":"100 ₧","equiv":"0.60","diameter":"24.5 mm"}]

4) Retrieve the full record for 100 ₧ with equiv 0.60
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.peseta WHERE value = '100 ₧' AND equiv = '0.60';
Result (one row): value: 100 ₧; equiv: 0.60; diameter: 24.5 mm; weight: 9.25 g; composition: aluminium bronze

Conclusion
- The database contains a single row for 100 ₧ with equivalence 0.60, and it lists the diameter as 24.5 mm. No conflicting diameters were found. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “value 100 ₧” refers to the 100 pesetas coin entry in public.peseta.
- “equiv of 0.60” refers to the equiv field value '0.60' stored in the table (consistent with 100 ESP ≈ 0.60 EUR by fixed conversion).
