Claim to verify: "the series number of the fall star be 20."

Data sources explored
- Available source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact", schema "public". Contains table: my_info_table (columns: episode, series, episode title, original air date, production code).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verified table structure (to ensure correct column names)
- SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='my_info_table';
- Result:
  episode (bigint), series (bigint), episode title (text), original air date (text), production code (bigint)

2) Checked exact title match for "The Fall Star" (to test the literal phrasing)
- SQL:
  SELECT series, episode, "episode title" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "episode title" = 'The Fall Star';
- Result:
  No rows returned (no episode exactly titled "The Fall Star").

3) Searched for episodes whose titles contain both "fall" and "star" (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT "series", "episode title" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%fall%' AND "episode title" ILIKE '%star%' ORDER BY "series", "episode";
- Result:
  [{"episode title":"the fallen star","series":20}]

Conclusion
- The table contains an episode titled "the fallen star" with series number 20. While there is no exact title "The Fall Star", the likely intended episode matches the numeric claim. Therefore, the claim that the series number is 20 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the fall star" as referring to the episode titled "the fallen star" found in the data, treating the slight title variation as a minor naming difference.
- "Series" is taken directly from the "series" column in my_info_table, which appears to represent the series/season number associated with the episode.
