Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One accessible PostgreSQL database named “TabFact” (public schema). No other sources detected.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query (context: TabFact)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
  - Columns: team (text), lost (bigint), last 5 (text), streak (text), home (text), away (text), % pts (double precision), % won (double precision)
  - Likely represents the 2008–09 NBL season standings with home/away records per team.

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results)
1) Verify exact team names present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season ORDER BY team;
Result:
- adelaide 36ers
- cairns taipans
- gold coast blaze
- melbourne tigers
- new zealand breakers
- perth wildcats
- south dragons
- sydney spirit
- townsville crocodiles
- wollongong hawks

2) Retrieve home records for the two teams in question
SQL:
SELECT team, home FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team IN ('melbourne tigers','south dragons') ORDER BY team;
Result:
- melbourne tigers | 11 - 4
- south dragons    | 13 - 2

3) Check if the home records are the same
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT home) AS distinct_home_values FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team IN ('melbourne tigers','south dragons');
Result:
- distinct_home_values = 2

Analysis
- The Melbourne Tigers’ home record is 11 - 4.
- The South Dragons’ home record is 13 - 2.
- Since there are two distinct home values (11 - 4 vs 13 - 2), the home records are not the same in the 2008–09 NBL season data available.

Conclusion
- The claim that “melbourne tiger have the same home record as south dragon” is not supported by the available data; they have different home records in the 2008–09 season.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 2008–09 NBL season because the accessible data source contains that season’s standings and includes both teams.
- Treated “home record” as the value in the “home” column of the standings table.
- Used exact team names as they appear in the dataset (lowercase).
