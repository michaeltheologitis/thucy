Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. In the available dataset of Galina Voskoboeva’s finals, her win rate on clay is not equal to her win rate on hard courts, and she has indeed won finals (so “she never win” is false).

Evidence from the data (SQL and results):

1) Distinct surfaces and outcomes (to understand data values)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT surface FROM public.galina_voskoboeva ORDER BY surface;
  Result rows:
  - clay
  - hard
  - hard (i)

- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT outcome FROM public.galina_voskoboeva ORDER BY outcome;
  Result rows:
  - runner - up
  - winner

Interpretation: This table records finals with outcomes "winner" (title won) or "runner - up" (lost final), and surfaces include clay, hard, and indoor hard (hard (i)).

2) Counts by surface and outcome
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(surface),''),'(empty)') AS surface, outcome, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  GROUP BY COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(surface),''),'(empty)'), outcome
  ORDER BY surface, outcome;

  Result rows (surface | outcome | count):
  - clay | runner - up | 1
  - clay | winner     | 1
  - hard | runner - up| 1
  - hard (i) | runner - up | 1
  - hard (i) | winner     | 1

3) Finals win rate by grouped surface (combining hard and hard (i))
- SQL executed:
  SELECT
    CASE
      WHEN surface='clay' THEN 'clay'
      WHEN surface IN ('hard','hard (i)') THEN 'hard (all)'
      ELSE 'other'
    END AS grouped_surface,
    SUM(CASE WHEN outcome='winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS winners,
    COUNT(*) AS total_finals,
    ROUND(100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN outcome='winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) / NULLIF(COUNT(*),0),2) AS win_rate_pct
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  GROUP BY grouped_surface
  ORDER BY grouped_surface;

  Query result:
  - clay: winners = 1, total_finals = 2, win rate = 50.00%
  - hard (all): winners = 1, total_finals = 3, win rate = 33.33%

Observation: Clay finals win rate (50.00%) is not equal to the combined hard-court finals win rate (33.33%). If we exclude indoor hard and use only “hard”, then winners = 0, total_finals = 1, win rate = 0%—also not equal to clay.

4) Proof she has won finals (contradicting “she never win”)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  WHERE outcome = 'winner'
  ORDER BY date;

  Returned rows:
  - Date: 29 june 2003 | Tournament: mont - de - marsan | Surface: hard (i) | Opponent: oleksandra kravets | Score: 6 - 4 , 6 - 2
  - Date: 6 june 2006 | Tournament: cuneo , italy | Surface: clay | Opponent: alice canepa | Score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 2

Assessment vs claim:
- “Equal winrate between clay and hard court”: Not supported. On clay, finals win rate = 50.00%; on hard (including indoor), finals win rate = 33.33%. Not equal. If considering only hard (excluding indoor), the win rate is 0%, also not equal to clay.
- “She never win”: False. The dataset records at least two finals she won (one on clay and one on indoor hard).

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The accessible dataset (public.galina_voskoboeva) appears to list finals only, not all matches. I interpret “winrate” here as finals title conversion rate (winners / total finals) because that is what the data supports.
- I grouped “hard” and “hard (i)” together under “hard (all)” for a broad “hard court” view, and I also note the results if “hard (i)” is excluded.
- Singles/doubles distinction is not specified in the table; analysis is limited to what the table records.
