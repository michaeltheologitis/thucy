Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lost by more than 2 goals on February 27 and February 29.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence 1: Retrieve the games on February 27 and February 29
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%February 27%'
   OR date ILIKE '%February 29%';

Result rows:
1) date: february 27 | visitor: minnesota | score: 3 - 2 | home: tampa bay | decision: backstrom
2) date: february 29 | visitor: minnesota | score: 3 - 2 | home: florida   | decision: backstrom

Interpretation: On both dates, Minnesota is listed as the visitor and the score is 3 - 2, which (visitor-home ordering) indicates Minnesota scored 3 and the opponent 2. That implies Minnesota won each game by 1 goal.

Evidence 2: Parse scores and compute Minnesota’s goal differential and whether they lost by more than 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score,
       CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer) AS visitor_goals,
       CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer) AS home_goals,
       CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
            WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
            ELSE NULL END AS minnesota_goals,
       CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
            WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
            ELSE NULL END AS opponent_goals,
       (CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
             WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
             ELSE NULL END)
       -
       (CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
             WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
             ELSE NULL END) AS goal_differential,
       ((CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
             WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
             ELSE NULL END)
       -
       (CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS integer)
             WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS integer)
             ELSE NULL END)) < -2 AS minnesota_lost_by_more_than_2
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
WHERE date IN ('february 27', 'february 29')
ORDER BY date;

Computed results summary:
- February 27: visitor_goals = 3, home_goals = 2; Minnesota goals = 3; opponent goals = 2; goal_differential = +1; lost by more than 2? false
- February 29: visitor_goals = 3, home_goals = 2; Minnesota goals = 3; opponent goals = 2; goal_differential = +1; lost by more than 2? false

Conclusion
- The data show Minnesota won 3–2 on both February 27 and February 29 during the 2007–08 season and therefore did not lose, let alone by more than 2 goals. The claim is contradicted by the season game results.

Assumptions
- The score field uses visitor-home ordering (common in schedules). This is consistent with Minnesota listed as visitor and the “decision: backstrom” (Minnesota’s goaltender) indicating wins.
- Date strings in the table are lowercase (e.g., 'february 27', 'february 29').
