Summary
- Claim interpreted: “Route 24 intersects with Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue.”
- Scope of available data: One table in the TabFact (public) schema: public.massachusetts_route_139. This table contains text fields including location, street names, roads intersected, and notes. No other road-network tables were available.

Data exploration
- Discovered data sources: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with public schema; a single relevant table: public.massachusetts_route_139 (columns: county, location, street names, milepost, roads intersected, notes — all text).

Evidence collected
1) Targeted search for the three street names and any mention of Route 24
Executed SQL:
SELECT location, "street names", "roads intersected", notes,
CASE WHEN (
    "street names" ILIKE '%route 24%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%rte 24%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%rt 24%'
    OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%route 24%' OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%rte 24%' OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%rt 24%'
    OR notes ILIKE '%route 24%' OR notes ILIKE '%rte 24%' OR notes ILIKE '%rt 24%'
) THEN 'yes' ELSE 'no' END AS route_24_mentioned
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE (
    "street names" ILIKE '%pleasant street%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%pleasant st%'
    OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%pleasant street%' OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%pleasant st%'
    OR "street names" ILIKE '%turnpike street%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%turnpike st%'
    OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%turnpike street%' OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%turnpike st%'
    OR "street names" ILIKE '%lindelof avenue%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%lindelof ave%'
    OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%lindelof avenue%' OR "roads intersected" ILIKE '%lindelof ave%'
);

Result:
- location: stoughton
  street names: pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue
  roads intersected: route 24
  notes: route 24 exit 20
  route_24_mentioned: yes

2) Cross-check: all rows where roads_intersected mentions Route 24
Executed SQL:
SELECT location, "street names", "roads intersected", notes
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE "roads intersected" ILIKE '%Route 24%';

Result:
- location: stoughton
  street names: pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue
  roads intersected: route 24
  notes: route 24 exit 20

Assessment
- The dataset documents, for Stoughton, that Route 139 has the local street names “Pleasant Street,” “Turnpike Street,” and “Lindelof Avenue,” and that at this location the “roads intersected” includes “Route 24” (noted as Exit 20).
- This supports that Route 24 intersects with the roadway locally known as Pleasant Street and Turnpike Street (these are names used for MA 139 near the interchange). 
- Lindelof Avenue appears in the “street names” list for the same record. However, the table structure does not explicitly state that Route 24 directly intersects Lindelof Avenue; it only shows that, in Stoughton, MA 139 (with those street names) intersects Route 24. From this data alone, direct intersection between Route 24 and Lindelof Avenue is not explicitly confirmed.

Conclusion
- Supported: Route 24 intersects with Pleasant Street and Turnpike Street (as part of MA 139 at Exit 20 in Stoughton).
- Not explicitly confirmed by the dataset: a direct Route 24 intersection with Lindelof Avenue.

Assumptions
- “Intersects with” is interpreted as an interchange/crossing connection.
- The “street names” column enumerates local names of MA 139 within the given location; “roads intersected” lists other routes intersecting MA 139 at or near that location. The dataset lacks geometry, so direct pairwise street-to-street connections beyond what the columns explicitly state cannot be inferred with certainty.
