Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
  - Columns: rank (bigint), airport (text), code (iata / icao) (text), total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint), % change (text)

Evidence 1: What is at rank 16?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT rank, airport, "code (iata / icao)" AS code
  FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
  WHERE rank = 16;
- Result: rank = 16, airport = london heathrow airport, code = lhr / egll
- Interpretation: At rank 16, the code is LHR / EGLL, not ORD / KORD.

Evidence 2: Where does ORD / KORD appear?
- Executed SQL (case-insensitive exact match on the full code field):
  SELECT rank, airport, "code (iata / icao)"
  FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
  WHERE lower("code (iata / icao)") = 'ord / kord';
- Result: rank = 17, airport = o'hare international airport, code = ord / kord
- Interpretation: ORD / KORD corresponds to rank 17 in this dataset, not rank 16.

Conclusion
- The claim that rank 16 has code (iata / icao) of ord / kord is contradicted by the data. Rank 16 is LHR / EGLL; ORD / KORD is rank 17.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the TabFact table world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic and its column "code (iata / icao)" containing the IATA/ICAO pair separated by " / ".
- Code comparisons are case-insensitive.
