Claim: “the buffalo bill lose 3 more game than they win.”

What I checked
- The available data source contains the 1976 Buffalo Bills season game-by-game results (table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season). I verified the number of wins and losses in that season and compared the difference.

Evidence from data (executed SQL shown exactly)
1) Count wins
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'W%';
Result: wins = 2

2) Count losses
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'L%';
Result: losses = 12

3) Count ties
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ties FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'T%';
Result: ties = 0

4) Total games (sanity check)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Result: total_games = 14

5) Direct computation of losses minus wins
SQL:
SELECT (SUM(CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(TRIM(result)),1) = 'L' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN LEFT(UPPER(TRIM(result)),1) = 'W' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS losses_minus_wins FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Result: losses_minus_wins = 10

Conclusion based on data
- In the 1976 season captured by the available dataset, the Buffalo Bills lost 12 games and won 2, so they lost 10 more games than they won—not 3 more. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The only accessible dataset pertains to the 1976 season; I interpret the claim as referring to the team’s performance in the season represented by the available data.
- Outcome is determined by the first character of the “result” field (W/L/T), normalized with TRIM/UPPER as needed.
