Claim to verify: “only 4 of the athlete have a mark greater than 29 foot.”

Data discovery and schema context
- Data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.long_jump with columns: mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text).
- Marks are recorded as text with a metric value followed by the imperial conversion in parentheses, e.g., “8.95 m (29ft4¼in)”.

Interpretation used for verification
- “greater than 29 foot” interpreted as strictly greater than 29.0 feet.
- Converted threshold to meters: 29 ft × 0.3048 = 8.8392 meters.
- Counted distinct athletes with a mark > 8.8392 m.

Evidence from the database
1) Total number of rows (context)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM public.long_jump;
Result:
- total_rows = 10

2) All rows ordered by parsed metric value (to see which exceed the threshold)
SQL:
SELECT athlete, mark, (substring(mark FROM '([0-9]+(?:\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision AS meters
FROM public.long_jump
ORDER BY meters DESC NULLS LAST, athlete, mark;
Results (meters parsed from the numeric text before “ m”):
1) mike powell — 8.95 m (29ft4¼in) — meters: 8.95
2) bob beamon — 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a — meters: 8.90
3) carl lewis — 8.87 m (29ft1in) — meters: 8.87
4) robert emmiyan — 8.86 m (29ft0¾in) a — meters: 8.86
5) dwight phillips — 8.74 m (28ft8in) — meters: 8.74
6) erick walder — 8.74 m (28ft8in) a — meters: 8.74
7) larry myricks — 8.74 m (28ft8in) — meters: 8.74
8) irving saladino — 8.73 m (28ft7½in) — meters: 8.73
9) iván pedroso — 8.71 m (28ft6¾in) — meters: 8.71
10) loúis tsátoumas — 8.66 m (28ft4¾in) — meters: 8.66
Observation: The top four marks are all strictly greater than 8.8392 m (29 ft); the rest are below.

3) Count of distinct athletes with marks strictly greater than 29 ft (8.8392 m)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athletes_above_threshold FROM (
  SELECT athlete,
    NULLIF(trim(replace(split_part(mark, ' m', 1), ',', '.')), '')::double precision AS parsed_m
  FROM public.long_jump
  WHERE mark LIKE '% m%'
) t
WHERE parsed_m > 8.8392;
Result:
- distinct_athletes_above_threshold = 4

Conclusion
- The database shows exactly 4 distinct athletes with marks strictly greater than 29 feet. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Greater than 29 foot” interpreted as strictly > 29.0 ft (not ≥ 29.0 ft).
- Used the metric value before the literal “ m” for numeric comparisons; this aligns with the mark text format in the table.
- Counted distinct athletes (not number of performances), which matches the phrasing “4 of the athlete(s)”.
