Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table: isabel_cueto with columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent in the final (text), score (text)

Evidence collected
1) Query to find rows in 1990:
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, "opponent in the final", score
FROM public.isabel_cueto
WHERE date LIKE '%1990%';
Result:
- date: 9 july 1990; tournament: palermo , italy; opponent in the final: barbara paulus; score: 6 - 2 , 6 - 3

2) Exact-date confirmation query:
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, "opponent in the final", score
FROM isabel_cueto
WHERE date = '9 july 1990';
Result:
- date: 9 july 1990; tournament: palermo , italy; opponent in the final: barbara paulus; score: 6 - 2 , 6 - 3

Conclusion
- The table records that on 9 july 1990 (same date as July 9, 1990, formatted day-first), the opponent in the final was barbara paulus. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the context of the available dataset (isabel_cueto), which appears to document Isabel Cueto’s finals. "Final" refers to the tournament final match. Date formatting differences ("9 july 1990" vs. "July 9, 1990") are considered equivalent.
