Data source discovery
- Discovered database: PostgreSQL (postgres_tabfact34), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Step 1: Identify games where New Jersey was the home team
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE home ILIKE '%New Jersey%';
Results:
- february 3 | ny islanders | 7 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 32 - 11
- february 6 | vancouver    | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 33 - 12
- february 15 | minnesota   | 3 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 36 - 12
- february 21 | buffalo     | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 37 - 13
- february 24 | detroit     | 1 - 4 | new jersey | 12 - 37 - 13
Observation: No entry for February 27 with New Jersey as home; closest is February 24 with score 1 - 4.

Step 2: Explicitly search for February 27 with New Jersey as home
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE (lower(date) LIKE '%february 27%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%feb 27%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%feb. 27%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%2/27%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%27 february%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%27 feb%')
  AND lower(home) LIKE '%new jersey%';
Result: no rows returned.
Observation: There is no record of a game on February 27 with New Jersey as the home team.

Step 3: Verify what happened on February 27 involving New Jersey

SELECT date, visitor, score, home FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'february%';
Results include:
- february 26 | new jersey | 4 - 5 | pittsburgh
- february 27 | new jersey | 2 - 6 | buffalo
Observation: On February 27, New Jersey was the visitor at Buffalo, and the score was 2 - 6, not 1 - 4, and New Jersey was not the home team.

Conclusion
- The data shows no game on February 27 with New Jersey as the home team.
- On February 27, New Jersey played at Buffalo with a score of 2 - 6.
- The closest match to the claimed score (1 - 4) with New Jersey as the home team occurred on February 24 versus Detroit.

Answer: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “New Jersey” refers to the home column literal value “new jersey.”
- Dates are stored as text and matched case-insensitively.
- The score string is reported as stored; the orientation (visitor-home) does not affect the verification of the date and home-team conditions in this claim.
