Summary
- Claim interpreted: Essendon were the away team in a match against Footscray.
- Scope: Verified against the accessible match-level dataset for the 1946 VFL season (public.t_1946_vfl_season).
- Finding: No match exists with Essendon as the away team and Footscray as the home team in this dataset. A match does exist with Essendon as the home team versus Footscray.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1946_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date").

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify exact team name spellings
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team_name
FROM (
  SELECT "home team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
  UNION
  SELECT "away team" FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
) t
ORDER BY team_name;
Result (excerpt): essendon, footscray (among others) — confirming names are lowercase.

2) Test the claim (Essendon away at Footscray home)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "away team" = 'essendon' AND "home team" = 'footscray';
Result: 0 rows returned.

3) Check the reverse orientation for context (Essendon home vs Footscray away)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score",venue,crowd,date
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "home team"='essendon' AND "away team"='footscray';
Result (1 row):
- home team: essendon
- home team score: 16.24 (120)
- away team: footscray
- away team score: 14.8 (92)
- venue: windy hill
- crowd: 29000
- date: 13 july 1946

Conclusion
- Within the 1946 VFL season dataset, there is no evidence that Essendon were the away team in a match against Footscray. The only match between these clubs shows Essendon at home and Footscray away.

Assumptions
- The claim was evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (1946 VFL season) because that is the authoritative data accessible here.
- Team names are matched exactly as stored (lowercase strings).
