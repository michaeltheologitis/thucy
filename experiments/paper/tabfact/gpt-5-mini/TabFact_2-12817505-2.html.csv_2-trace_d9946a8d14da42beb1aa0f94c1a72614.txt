Claim interpreted: “Manchester United have lost to Blackburn Rovers 2 out of 2 times since 13 August 2005.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3)
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season — records Manchester United’s 2005–06 season match data (date, opponents, home/away, final score from Man United’s perspective, attendance, league position).

Evidence
1) Locate all matches vs Blackburn Rovers
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", "league position" 
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Blackburn%';

Results:
- 24 september 2005 | blackburn rovers | h | 1 - 2 | 6th
- 1 february 2006   | blackburn rovers | a | 3 - 4 | 2nd

2) Verify they occur on/after 13 August 2005 and count outcomes
Executed SQL (counts):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games,
       SUM(CASE WHEN split_part("result f - a",' - ',1)::int < split_part("result f - a",' - ',2)::int THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE opponents ILIKE '%blackburn%'
  AND to_date(date,'DD Month YYYY')::date >= DATE '2005-08-13';

Result:
- total_games: 2
- losses: 2

Executed SQL (detail with parsed dates/scores):
SELECT date,
       to_date(date,'DD Month YYYY')::date AS parsed_date,
       "result f - a" AS score,
       split_part("result f - a",' - ',1)::int AS goals_for,
       split_part("result f - a",' - ',2)::int AS goals_against,
       CASE WHEN split_part("result f - a",' - ',1)::int > split_part("result f - a",' - ',2)::int THEN 'win'
            WHEN split_part("result f - a",' - ',1)::int = split_part("result f - a",' - ',2)::int THEN 'draw'
            ELSE 'loss' END AS outcome
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE opponents ILIKE '%blackburn%'
  AND to_date(date,'DD Month YYYY')::date >= DATE '2005-08-13';

Rows returned:
- 2005-09-24 | 1 - 2 | goals_for=1 | goals_against=2 | outcome=loss
- 2006-02-01 | 3 - 4 | goals_for=3 | goals_against=4 | outcome=loss

Conclusion
- Since 13 August 2005 (inclusive), Manchester United played Blackburn Rovers twice in the 2005–06 season data available, and lost both matches. The claim is supported by the data: 2 losses out of 2 matches.

Assumptions
- “Since 13 August 2005” is treated as inclusive.
- The dataset reflects Manchester United’s 2005–06 league season; the “result f - a” field is from Manchester United’s perspective. The claim is evaluated against this dataset (league matches).
