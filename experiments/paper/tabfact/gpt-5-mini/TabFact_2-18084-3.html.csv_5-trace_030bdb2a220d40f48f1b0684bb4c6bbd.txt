Claim to verify: "few athlete from the united state have the longest mark"

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact7 (PostgreSQL) with one relevant table: public.long_jump
  - Columns: mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text)

What I checked
- Interpreted "longest mark" as the maximum long jump distance recorded in the public.long_jump table.
- Verified who holds that maximum and their nationality.
- Counted how many athletes at that top mark are from the United States.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Maximum mark in meters (extracted as the first numeric value in the mark text)
SQL:
SELECT MAX((regexp_match(mark, '([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)'))[1]::double precision) AS max_meters
FROM public.long_jump
WHERE mark ~ '[0-9]';
Result:
- max_meters = 8.95

2) Athletes who achieved that top mark (with nationality and raw mark)
SQL:
SELECT athlete, nationality, mark AS raw_mark, (regexp_match(mark, '([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)'))[1]::double precision AS meters
FROM public.long_jump
WHERE (regexp_match(mark, '([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)'))[1]::double precision = 8.95;
Result rows:
- athlete: mike powell; nationality: united states; raw_mark: "8.95 m (29ft4¼in)"; meters: 8.95

3) Count of United States/USA athletes among those with the top mark
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE nationality ILIKE 'usa' OR nationality ILIKE 'united%') AS count_us_athletes,
       COUNT(*) AS total_top_athletes
FROM (
  SELECT nationality, (regexp_match(mark, '([0-9]+\.?[0-9]*)'))[1]::double precision AS meters
  FROM public.long_jump
) t
WHERE meters = 8.95;
Result:
- count_us_athletes = 1
- total_top_athletes = 1

Assessment
- The dataset shows that the single longest long jump mark (8.95 m) is held by one athlete, Mike Powell, whose nationality is listed as "united states". Thus, the number of United States athletes who have the longest mark in this table is one, which is indeed a small number.
- If the claim is read as "a few (more than one) athletes from the United States have the longest mark," the data contradicts that (only one athlete holds it). If read as "few (not many) athletes from the United States have the longest mark," the data supports it.

Conclusion
- Based on the public.long_jump table, exactly one athlete (Mike Powell, United States) holds the longest mark (8.95 m). Interpreted as "not many," the claim is supported; interpreted as "a few" (plural), it is not.

Assumptions and scope
- "Longest mark" is interpreted as the top long jump distance in the available long jump dataset (public.long_jump). No other events or sports are included in this data source.
- Nationality matching used a case-insensitive check for values like "United States" or "USA".
- Mark parsing extracted the first numeric value from the mark text to represent meters.
