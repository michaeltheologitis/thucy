Claim interpreted: “The friendly competition at the venue Shymkent, Kazakhstan was on June 2, 2007.”

What I checked in the data:
1) All records at the venue Shymkent
- SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score
  FROM public.branimir_suba_i
  WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%shymkent%';
- Result:
  - date: march 7 , 2007 | venue: shymkent , kazakhstan | competition: friendly | result: win | score: 0 - 1

2) Any records dated June 2, 2007 (across common formats)
- SQL 1 (broad 2007 scan):
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score
  FROM public.branimir_suba_i
  WHERE date ILIKE '%2007%'
  LIMIT 200;
  Excerpt of returned rows:
  - {competition: friendly, date: march 7 , 2007, result: win, score: 0 - 1, venue: shymkent , kazakhstan}
  - {competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying, date: june 2 , 2007, result: lost, score: 1 - 3, venue: baku , azerbaijan}
  - {competition: friendly, date: august 22 , 2007, result: win, score: 2 - 3, venue: dushanbe , tajikistan}
  - {competition: friendly, date: september 12 , 2007, result: draw, score: 1 - 1, venue: baku , azerbaijan}
- SQL 2 (June 2, 2007 formats):
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score
  FROM public.branimir_suba_i
  WHERE date ILIKE '%june 2%'
     OR date ILIKE '%2 june%'
     OR date ILIKE '%02/06/2007%'
     OR date ILIKE '%2/6/2007%'
     OR date ILIKE '%2007-06-02%'
     OR date ILIKE '%20070602%'
     OR date ILIKE '%02.06.2007%'
     OR date ILIKE '%02-06-2007%'
     OR date ILIKE '%06/02/2007%'
  LIMIT 200;
- Result:
  - date: june 2 , 2007 | venue: baku , azerbaijan | competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying | result: lost | score: 1 - 3

3) All friendlies in Kazakhstan (to confirm uniqueness)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, result, score
  FROM public.branimir_suba_i
  WHERE lower(competition) = 'friendly'
    AND lower(venue) LIKE '%kazakhstan%';
- Result:
  - date: march 7 , 2007 | venue: shymkent , kazakhstan | result: win | score: 0 - 1

Findings:
- The only friendly listed at Shymkent, Kazakhstan in 2007 occurred on March 7, 2007.
- June 2, 2007 in this dataset corresponds to a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match held in Baku, Azerbaijan—not a friendly and not in Shymkent.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the friendly at Shymkent, Kazakhstan was on June 2, 2007 is contradicted by the data. The friendly at that venue occurred on March 7, 2007.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as asserting the date of a specific friendly at the venue “shymkent , kazakhstan”.
- The table public.branimir_suba_i is treated as the authoritative source for these events, as per instructions.
