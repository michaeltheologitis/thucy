Claim being checked: “Lleyton Hewitt faced the same opponent, Wayne Ferreira, in every Masters Series final.”

Step 1 — Explore data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact16.
- Schema inspection shows a relevant table: public.lleyton_hewitt(outcome text, year bigint, championship text, surface text, opponent text, score text).

Step 2 — Inspect the dataset contents
Executed SQL and results:
1) Row count
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: row_count = 7

2) List all rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result (championship | year | opponent | outcome | surface | score):
- stuttgart | 2000 | wayne ferreira | runner - up | hard (i) | 6 - 7 (6 - 8) , 6 - 3 , 7 - 6 (7 - 5) , 6 - 7 (2 - 7) , 2 - 6
- indian wells | 2002 | tim henman | winner | hard | 6 - 1 , 6 - 2
- cincinnati | 2002 | carlos moyá | runner - up | hard | 5 - 7 , 6 - 7 (5 - 7)
- paris | 2002 | marat safin | runner - up | carpet (i) | 6 - 7 (4 - 7) , 0 - 6 , 4 - 6
- indian wells (2) | 2003 | gustavo kuerten | winner | hard | 6 - 1 , 6 - 1
- cincinnati (2) | 2004 | andre agassi | runner - up | hard | 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 2 - 6
- indian wells | 2005 | roger federer | runner - up | hard | 2 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6

Step 3 — Directly test the claim
Executed SQL and results:
1) Count all finals vs. Wayne Ferreira
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ferreira_finals FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE lower(opponent) = 'wayne ferreira';
Result: ferreira_finals = 1

2) Count all finals
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_finals FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: total_finals = 7

3) List finals where opponent is not Wayne Ferreira
SQL:
SELECT outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE lower(opponent) IS DISTINCT FROM 'wayne ferreira' ORDER BY year;
Results show six finals vs. other opponents: Tim Henman, Carlos Moyá, Marat Safin, Gustavo Kuerten, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer.

Conclusion based on data
- Lleyton Hewitt reached 7 Masters Series finals in this dataset.
- He faced Wayne Ferreira in only 1 of those finals (Stuttgart 2000).
- In the remaining 6 finals, his opponents were different players (Henman, Moyá, Safin, Kuerten, Agassi, Federer).
- Therefore, the claim that he faced Wayne Ferreira in every Masters Series final is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “Masters Series final” as ATP Masters Series (now ATP Masters 1000) finals, which matches the tournaments listed (Stuttgart, Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris).
- Treated each row in public.lleyton_hewitt as a Masters Series final appearance, with outcome indicating winner or runner-up.
- Case-insensitive comparison used for opponent names.
