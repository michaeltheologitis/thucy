Claim to verify: “7 viral family have a helical virion shape.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance for TabFact (postgres_tabfact17). Public schema contains table: public.viral_disease.

Schema overview
- Table public.viral_disease columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text).

Evidence
1) Distinct virion-shape values and their counts
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COALESCE("virion shape", '(NULL)') AS virion_shape, COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  GROUP BY COALESCE("virion shape", '(NULL)')
  ORDER BY row_count DESC, virion_shape;
- Result (relevant entries):
  - icosahedral: 13
  - helical: 6
  - complex: 2
  - helical , bullet shaped: 1
  - spherical: 1

2) Distinct viral families whose virion shape indicates helical morphology
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT family, "virion shape" FROM public.viral_disease WHERE lower("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';
- Result (families and their virion shape values):
  - arenaviridae — helical
  - bunyaviridae — helical
  - coronaviridae — helical
  - filoviridae — helical
  - orthomyxoviridae — helical
  - paramyxoviridae — helical
  - rhabdoviridae — helical , bullet shaped

3) Count of distinct families with helical morphology
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS distinct_family_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';
- Result: 7 distinct viral families.

Conclusion
- The database shows 7 distinct viral families whose virion shape field contains “helical,” supporting the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “have a helical virion shape” as any virion shape text containing the substring “helical” (case-insensitive), including combined descriptors such as “helical , bullet shaped.”
- Interpreted “viral family” as the distinct values in the family column of public.viral_disease.
