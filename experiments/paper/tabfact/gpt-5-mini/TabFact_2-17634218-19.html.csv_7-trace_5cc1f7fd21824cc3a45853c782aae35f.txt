Claim interpreted: “The only total that appears more than 2 times is 31.” Interpreted as: in the relevant dataset’s total column, the only value with frequency strictly greater than 2 is 31.

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public.
- Relevant table and columns (from schema inspection): public.list_of_sumo_record_holders with columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text). The only column named ‘total’ is in this table.

Evidence
1) Identify all total values that occur more than 2 times
Executed SQL:
SELECT total, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY total
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY cnt DESC, total;
Result: [{"total": 22, "cnt": 3}]
Interpretation: The only total value with count > 2 is 22 (appears 3 times), not 31.

2) Directly verify the count for total = 31
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE total = 31;
Result: {"count": 1}
Executed SQL:
SELECT name FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE total = 31 ORDER BY name;
Result: {"name": "musōyama"}
Interpretation: total = 31 appears only once.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that total = 22 (not 31) is the only value occurring more than twice.

Assumptions
- “appear more than 2 time” was treated as frequency strictly greater than 2 (count > 2).
- The claim pertains to the total column in public.list_of_sumo_record_holders, the only available table with a column named total in the accessible data source.
