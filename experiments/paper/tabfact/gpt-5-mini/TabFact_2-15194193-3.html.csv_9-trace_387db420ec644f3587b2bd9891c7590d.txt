Claim to verify: “Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi 10 times, more than any other team, and won all of them.”

Findings:
- Raced for Aermacchi 10 times: Supported by data.
- More than any other team: Supported by data (next highest counts are 4).
- Won all of them: Contradicted by data (wins recorded as 0 in all Aermacchi entries).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count entries per team (to verify “10 times” and “more than any other team”)
SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.alberto_pagani
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result (team — count):
- aermacchi — 10
- norton — 4
- mv agusta — 4
- linto — 4
- honda — 2
- derbi — 1
- paton — 1
- suzuki — 1
- ducati — 1
- kreidler — 1

2) Detail Aermacchi rows and wins (to verify “won all of them”)
SQL:
SELECT year, class, points, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE team = 'aermacchi' ORDER BY year;
Rows (year, class, points, wins):
- 1960, 250cc, 2, 0
- 1961, 250cc, 0, 0
- 1965, 250cc, 1, 0
- 1965, 350cc, 0, 0
- 1966, 250cc, 4, 0
- 1966, 350cc, 11, 0
- 1967, 250cc, 0, 0
- 1967, 350cc, 11, 0
- 1969, 350cc, 0, 0
- 1970, 250cc, 4, 0

3) Aggregate wins condition for Aermacchi rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE wins > 0) AS wins_gt_0, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE wins = 0) AS wins_eq_0 FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE team = 'aermacchi';
Result:
- wins > 0: 0 rows
- wins = 0: 10 rows

Conclusion:
- The data confirms Pagani has 10 entries with Aermacchi, which is more than any other team in this dataset. However, he did not record any wins in those Aermacchi entries, so the statement “win all of them” is false.

Assumptions:
- “Race for Aermacchi 10 times” is interpreted as 10 season-class entries in the table where team = 'aermacchi'.
- “Win all of them” is interpreted as having at least one win in each of those entries; the wins field represents number of race wins in that season/class (all recorded as 0).
