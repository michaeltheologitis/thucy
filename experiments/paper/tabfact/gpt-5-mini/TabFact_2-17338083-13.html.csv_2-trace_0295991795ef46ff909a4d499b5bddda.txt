Claim to verify: “yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai.”

Interpretation: Check whether, in the available data, for entries where the state is Cai and the royal house is Ji, the recorded name is Yi.

Evidence from data queries:
1) Query used to confirm the exact state formatting (case differences):
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "state" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc ORDER BY "state";
Result (excerpt): ["cai", "cao", "chen", "chu", "jin", "lu", "qi", "qin", "song", "wey", "yan"]

2) Query to retrieve entries for state Cai and royal house Ji:
SQL executed:
SELECT "state","name","title","royal house","type" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE lower("state") = 'cai' AND lower("royal house") = 'ji';
Result:
- state: cai; name: yi; title: marquis; royal house: ji; type: sovereign

Assessment:
- The dataset contains an entry where the state is Cai and the royal house is Ji, and the recorded name is Yi. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Case-insensitive matching was used for filtering values (stored as lowercase in the table). The table pertains to leaders in the 820s BC; the claim did not specify a time frame, so verification is limited to the scope of this dataset.
