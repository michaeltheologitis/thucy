Claim to verify: “There are a total of 4 countries represented by the players.”

Data source explored:
- TabFact (PostgreSQL) public schema. Relevant table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf with columns [place, player, country, score, to par, money]. This table contains player names and their countries.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Count distinct countries
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS distinct_countries FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf;
Result:
distinct_countries = 4

2) List distinct countries
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY country;
Result:
country
- japan
- spain
- united states
- wales

Finding:
- The table shows 4 distinct country values among the players: japan, spain, united states, and wales.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Players” refers to all rows in t_1989_u_s_open_golf.
- Countries are counted as distinct based on their exact text values (no normalization beyond what’s stored; NULLs, if any, are not counted).
