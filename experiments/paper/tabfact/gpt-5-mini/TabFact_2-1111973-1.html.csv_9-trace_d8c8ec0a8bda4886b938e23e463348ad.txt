the vcpc and vctp of 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun be the same for vcrt 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon , and so be the vcpc and vcrt of 75 km / h (47 mph) for vctp 75 km / h (47 mph)

Claim (interpreted):
- The VCPC and VCTP have the 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun while the VCRT has the 20 mm (79 in) RH-202 autocannon; and the VCPC and VCRT have a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), same as the VCTP.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.tam_tank with columns [vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt]

Executed SQL (evidence):
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
- Key returned rows (relevant cells):
  • Armament row:
    - vctp: "20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon"
    - vcpc: "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
    - vcrt: "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
  • Speed row:
    - vctp: "75 km / h (47 mph)"
    - vcpc: "75 km / h (47 mph)"
    - vcrt: "75 km / h (47 mph)"

Assessment:
- Armament
  • Claim says VCPC and VCTP have 7.62 mm FN MAG and VCRT has 20 mm RH-202. The data contradicts this: VCTP has the 20 mm RH-202 autocannon, while VCPC and VCRT have the 7.62 mm FN MAG machine gun.
  • Verdict on armament portion: False.
- Speed
  • Claim says VCPC and VCRT have 75 km/h, same as VCTP. The data shows 75 km/h (47 mph) for VCTP, VCPC, and VCRT.
  • Verdict on speed portion: True.

Conclusion:
- The armament mapping in the claim is incorrect (reversed), while the speed parity at 75 km/h is correct.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted acronyms as TAM-family variants: VCTP (infantry carrier), VCPC (command), VCRT (recovery). I relied strictly on the values present in public.tam_tank in the TabFact database as authoritative per instructions.
