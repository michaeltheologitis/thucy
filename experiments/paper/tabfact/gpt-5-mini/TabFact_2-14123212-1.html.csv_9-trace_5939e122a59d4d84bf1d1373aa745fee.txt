Claim to verify: “englewood , illinois have 2 translator.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact4 (schema: public)
- Available table: public.whlp (columns: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info)

What I checked
- Counted and listed all entries in public.whlp whose city of license corresponds to Englewood, Illinois.

Findings
- The data contains exactly 1 entry for Englewood, Illinois, not 2.
- Matching record: call sign w264bf, frequency 100.7 MHz, class d (FCC info: fcc).

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Equality check for exact string (to understand formatting):
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.whlp
WHERE lower(trim("city of license")) = 'englewood, illinois';
Result: match_count = 0

2) Case-insensitive substring match requiring both tokens “englewood” and “illinois”:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "class", "fcc info"
FROM public.whlp
WHERE lower("city of license") LIKE '%englewood%'
  AND lower("city of license") LIKE '%illinois%';
Returned rows: 1
- w264bf | 100.7 | englewood , illinois | d | fcc

3) Broader Illinois match (accepting ‘Illinois’ or ‘, IL’ or ‘ IL’):
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "class"
FROM public.whlp
WHERE lower("city of license") LIKE '%englewood%'
  AND (
    lower("city of license") LIKE '%illinois%'
    OR lower("city of license") LIKE '%, il%'
    OR lower("city of license") LIKE '% il%'
  );
Returned rows: 1
- w264bf | 100.7 | englewood , illinois | d

4) Count of entries requiring both tokens “englewood” and “illinois”:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.whlp
WHERE lower("city of license") LIKE '%englewood%'
  AND lower("city of license") LIKE '%illinois%';
Result: 1

Conclusion
- The available authoritative dataset shows 1 Englewood, Illinois entry, not 2. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Translator” is interpreted in the context of radio facilities; class “d” entries in FCC-style datasets typically correspond to translators/low-power services.
- City matching was done case-insensitively and allowed minor punctuation/spacing variations (e.g., “englewood , illinois”).
- The public.whlp table is treated as the authoritative dataset for this verification within the accessible data environment.
