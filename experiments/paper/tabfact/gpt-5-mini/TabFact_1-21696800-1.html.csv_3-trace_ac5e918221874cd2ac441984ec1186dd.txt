Claim to verify: "the title kandor have 2.63 million us viewer"

What I checked
- I discovered an available data source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table public.smallville_season_9 that includes episode titles and a column for US viewers (million).
- Relevant schema context for public.smallville_season_9:
  - Columns include: title (text) and us viewers (million) (double precision).

Evidence
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE title ILIKE '%Kandor%';
- Result row:
  title: kandor; us viewers (million): 2.63

Conclusion
- The data shows the episode titled "Kandor" has 2.63 million US viewers. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "title kandor" refers to the Smallville Season 9 episode titled "Kandor" in the available dataset.
- Case-insensitive title matching is acceptable (database stores it as lowercase).
