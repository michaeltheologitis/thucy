Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date text, site text, sport text, "winning team" text, series text)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Inspect date formats to inform parsing
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series ORDER BY date DESC LIMIT 50;

Result:
- max_date: 2008-04-01

3) List the sport(s) on that latest date
Executed SQL:
SELECT sport, date FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE to_date(date,'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY') = (SELECT MAX(to_date(date,'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY')) FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series);
Result:
- date: april 1 , 2008  |  sport: softball
