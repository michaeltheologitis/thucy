Claim: 2 episode title consist entirely of number.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Table: list_of_all_that_episodes
  - Columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "nick prod" (bigint)

Evidence 1 — Identify all episodes whose title is only digits:
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE trim("episode title") ~ '^[0-9]+$'
ORDER BY series, season, CAST(trim("episode title") AS bigint);

Result rows:
- season: 8, series: 45, episode title: 702, original air date: december 28 , 1996
- season: 11, series: 48, episode title: 112, original air date: january 18 , 1997

Evidence 2 — Count such episodes:
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS digit_only_count
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE trim("episode title") ~ '^[0-9]+$';

Result:
- digit_only_count: 2

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains exactly 2 episodes whose titles consist entirely of digits. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Consist entirely of number” interpreted as titles that, after trimming whitespace, contain only the characters 0–9 (regex ^[0-9]+$).
