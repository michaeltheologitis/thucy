Claim: “kenny perry earn 170000 less than mark brook.”

Data source: postgres_tabfact3 (TabFact), schema public, table t_1996_pga_championship.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Kenny Perry and Mark Brook(s) prize money
SQL:
SELECT player, money FROM t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE 'Kenny Perry' OR player ILIKE 'Mark Brook%';
Result:
- mark brooks — money: 430000
- kenny perry — money: 260000

2) Compute the difference (Mark Brooks minus Kenny Perry)
SQL:
SELECT (MAX(CASE WHEN player='mark brooks' THEN money END) - MAX(CASE WHEN player='kenny perry' THEN money END)) AS money_diff FROM t_1996_pga_championship;
Result:
- money_diff: 170000

Conclusion:
- Kenny Perry’s prize money (260,000) is 170,000 less than Mark Brooks’s (430,000) in this dataset, matching the claim exactly.

Assumptions made:
- “mark brook” refers to golfer Mark Brooks as stored in the table.
- “earn” refers to prize money from the 1996 PGA Championship (the scope of the available table).
