Claim to verify: “Lleyton Hewitt never faced the same opponent in more than one Masters Series final.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.lleyton_hewitt with columns (outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score).

Schema context:
- The table lists Lleyton Hewitt’s finals results with the tournament name (championship), year, opponent, result (winner/runner-up), surface, and score. Championship names present correspond to ATP Masters Series/ATP Masters 1000 events (Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris, Stuttgart [Masters in 2000]).

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Identify which championships are present in the dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT championship FROM public.lleyton_hewitt ORDER BY championship ASC;
Results:
- cincinnati
- cincinnati (2)
- indian wells
- indian wells (2)
- paris
- stuttgart

2) List Hewitt’s finals by year with opponent
SQL executed:
SELECT year, championship, opponent
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt
ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2000 — stuttgart — wayne ferreira
- 2002 — indian wells — tim henman
- 2002 — cincinnati — carlos moyá
- 2002 — paris — marat safin
- 2003 — indian wells (2) — gustavo kuerten
- 2004 — cincinnati (2) — andre agassi
- 2005 — indian wells — roger federer

3) Count how many times each opponent appears across these finals
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS appearances
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY appearances DESC, opponent;
Results (opponent — appearances):
- andre agassi — 1
- carlos moyá — 1
- gustavo kuerten — 1
- marat safin — 1
- roger federer — 1
- tim henman — 1
- wayne ferreira — 1

Conclusion: Based on the dataset of Lleyton Hewitt’s Masters Series finals, each opponent appears exactly once. Therefore, Hewitt did not face the same opponent in more than one Masters Series final.

Assumptions made:
- “Masters Series final” refers to ATP Masters Series/ATP Masters 1000 finals. The championships listed (Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris, and Stuttgart in 2000) are treated as Masters events within this dataset.
- The public.lleyton_hewitt table is complete for Hewitt’s Masters Series finals; accessible data sources are considered authoritative per instructions.
