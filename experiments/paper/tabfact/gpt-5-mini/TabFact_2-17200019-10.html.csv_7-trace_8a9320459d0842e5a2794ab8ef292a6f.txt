Summary
- I explored the available data and found a single relevant table for R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season with player goal counts by competition categories: league, title playoff, super cup, and total. There is no explicit column for the Belgian Cup.
- Because the dataset has no field named Belgian Cup or equivalent, the specific claim about Belgian Cup goals cannot be directly verified from the data.
- As a reasonable proxy, I computed “other_goals” = total − (league + title playoff + super cup). These “other_goals” would include goals from competitions not itemized in the table (likely including the Belgian Cup and possibly European competitions). Under this proxy, Lucas Biglia does not have more goals than the other players combined.

Evidence
1) Full table contents
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;

Key rows (from the returned results):
- lucas biglia | league: 2 | title playoff: 0 | super cup: 0 | total: 3
- matías suárez | league: 1 | title playoff: 0 | super cup: 1 | total: 3
- jonathan legear | league: 5 | title playoff: 1 | super cup: 0 | total: 7
- guillaume gillet | league: 8 | title playoff: 0 | super cup: 0 | total: 9
(Full result set used; shown here are representative rows relevant to the analysis.)

2) Implied goals outside the listed columns (proxy for competitions not itemized, such as domestic cup)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, total - (league + "title playoff" + "super cup") AS other_goals
FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE (total - (league + "title playoff" + "super cup")) > 0
ORDER BY other_goals DESC;

Result (players with other_goals > 0):
- guillaume gillet: 1
- jonathan legear: 1
- lucas biglia: 1
- jan polák: 1
- matías suárez: 1
- hernán losada: 1
- nemanja rnić: 1

Assessment of the claim
- The claim refers to “the 4 player who play in the Belgian Cup” and compares Lucas Biglia’s goals to the others combined. The dataset does not identify Belgian Cup explicitly nor appearances (“play”). Therefore, the claim cannot be verified as stated.
- Using a reasonable proxy (other_goals), there are 7 players with at least one goal in competitions outside league/title playoff/super cup, and Lucas Biglia has 1 such goal. The other players combined have 6 such goals. Under this interpretation, Lucas Biglia did not outscore the rest combined.

Conclusion
- The data does not provide Belgian Cup-specific goal counts or player appearances, so the claim is unsupported by the available evidence. Moreover, under a plausible proxy, the comparison is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions (for transparency)
- The table t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season pertains to R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season and the “total” column aggregates all competitions.
- “Other_goals” (total − league − title playoff − super cup) is used as an indicative proxy for goals in competitions not itemized, which likely includes the Belgian Cup and possibly European competitions. This proxy cannot isolate the Belgian Cup alone.
- The phrase “play in the Belgian Cup” was interpreted as relating to scoring in that competition, since the dataset does not contain appearance data.
