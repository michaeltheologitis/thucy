Claim to verify: “14.13 (97) be the home team score of the match played at Western Oval.”

Data source explored: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema, table t_1969_vfl_season with columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date.

Step 1 — Identify whether “Western Oval” exists as a venue in this dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "venue" FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season ORDER BY "venue";
Result:
- kardinia park
- mcg
- moorabbin oval
- princes park
- victoria park
- western oval

Step 2 — Retrieve the match(es) played at Western Oval and check the home team score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", crowd
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) = 'western oval'
ORDER BY date;
Result (only match at this venue in the table):
- Date: 23 august 1969
  Home team: footscray
  Home team score: 14.10 (94)
  Away team: essendon
  Away team score: 12.10 (82)
  Crowd: 16043

Step 3 — Context: confirm there is just one row per venue (so “the match at Western Oval” in this dataset refers to this single row)
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season GROUP BY venue ORDER BY matches DESC, venue;
Result:
- kardinia park: 1
- mcg: 1
- moorabbin oval: 1
- princes park: 1
- victoria park: 1
- western oval: 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season;
Result: 6

Conclusion based on data:
- The only match in this dataset played at Western Oval has the home team score 14.10 (94), not 14.13 (97). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data available here.

Assumptions:
- “the match played at Western Oval” refers to the single Western Oval entry present in this table (t_1969_vfl_season). If the intent was to reference a different season/table, that data is not present in the accessible dataset.
