Claim to verify: “daniel uberti leave fa on 29 december 2008.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact/postgres_tabfact24
- Table: public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
  Columns: team (text), outgoing manager (text), manner of departure (text), date of vacancy (text), replaced by (text), date of appointment (text), position in table (text)

What I checked:
1) Whether any record shows Daniel Uberti associated with a team named “FAS” (or similar) and a vacancy on 29 December 2008.
2) Whether any record shows Daniel Uberti leaving any club on 29 December 2008.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Search for FAS + Daniel Uberti (no matches)
SQL:
SELECT "team","outgoing manager","manner of departure","date of vacancy","replaced by","date of appointment"
FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
WHERE lower("team") LIKE '%fas%'
  AND (lower("outgoing manager") LIKE '%daniel uberti%' OR lower("replaced by") LIKE '%daniel uberti%');
Result: 0 rows

2) Search for any occurrences of Uberti as outgoing or incoming manager
SQL:
SELECT "team","outgoing manager","manner of departure","date of vacancy","replaced by","date of appointment"
FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
WHERE lower("outgoing manager") LIKE '%uberti%' OR lower("replaced by") LIKE '%uberti%';
Returned rows:
- team: nejapa; outgoing manager: mauricio cienfuegos; manner of departure: mutual consent; date of vacancy: 14 august 2008; replaced by: daniel uberti; date of appointment: 5 september 2008
- team: nejapa; outgoing manager: daniel uberti; manner of departure: sacked; date of vacancy: 29 december 2008; replaced by: nelson ancheta; date of appointment: 29 december 2008

Findings:
- The data shows Daniel Uberti left Nejapa on 29 December 2008 (sacked), replaced by Nelson Ancheta on the same date.
- There is no record in this dataset showing Daniel Uberti associated with FAS (or any team containing “FAS”) in Apertura 2008.

Conclusion:
- If “fa” refers to FAS, the claim is incorrect regarding the club. The correct club is Nejapa, and the date (29 December 2008) matches his departure from Nejapa.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “fa” as likely “FAS,” the Salvadoran club, given the dataset context (El Salvador Apertura 2008). Searched for team names containing “fas” case-insensitively.
- Treated “leave” as reflected in the “outgoing manager” and “date of vacancy” fields.
