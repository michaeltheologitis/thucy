Summary conclusion
The claim is false. The data show there is 1 tournament entry after 2012 with a winner's share less than 15400 (specifically, year 2013 with a winner's share of 15000).

Evidence from the database
- Data source discovered: Database TabFact, schema public, table northeast_delta_dental_international with columns: year (bigint), dates (text), champion (text), country (text), score (text), tournament location (text), purse (bigint), winner 's share (bigint).

Query 1: Count rows after 2012 with winner's share < 15400
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international
WHERE year > 2012
  AND "winner \'s share" < 15400;
Result:
count_rows = 1

Query 2: List the years and winner's share for such rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "winner \'s share"
FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international
WHERE year > 2012
  AND "winner \'s share" < 15400
ORDER BY year;
Result:
year = 2013, winner 's share = 15000

Additional context checks
- Total rows after 2012:
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows_after_2012
FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international
WHERE year > 2012;
Result:
total_rows_after_2012 = 1

- Minimum winner's share for rows after 2012:
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN("winner \'s share") AS min_winner_share_after_2012
FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international
WHERE year > 2012;
Result:
min_winner_share_after_2012 = 15000

Interpretation
Because there is one post-2012 entry (2013) with a winner's share of 15000, which is below 15400, the claim that there are zero such cases is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "After 2012" is interpreted as year > 2012 (i.e., 2013 and later).
- "Purse" refers to tournament entries (rows) in this table, with the condition evaluated on the "winner 's share" column.
- The TabFact.public.northeast_delta_dental_international table is treated as the authoritative source for this verification.
