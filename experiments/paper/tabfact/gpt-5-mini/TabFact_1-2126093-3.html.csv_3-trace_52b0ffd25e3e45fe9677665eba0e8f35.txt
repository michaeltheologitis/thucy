Claim interpreted: “The winning score of the Vernal Ladies tournament was set in September 2006 at 203.”

Data source discovery and scope:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.ai_miyazato (columns include: date, tournament, winning score, to par, margin of victory, runner(s)-up)

What I checked:
1) Whether there is a “Vernal Ladies” tournament entry, and what its winning score and date are.
2) Whether any “Vernal Ladies” entry exists in 2006, specifically September 2006.

Evidence and executed SQL:
- Query A: Find any rows for tournaments containing “Vernal”
  SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Vernal%';
  Result:
  - no: 7
  - date: 15 may 2005
  - tournament: vernal ladies
  - winning score: 69 + 64 + 70 = 203
  - to par: - 13
  - margin of victory: 8 strokes
  - runner (s) - up: akiko fukushima

- Query B: Count rows exactly matching “Vernal Ladies”
  SQL:
  SELECT count(*) FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Vernal Ladies%';
  Result: 1

- Query C: Check for any “Vernal Ladies” entry in 2006
  SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Vernal Ladies%' AND date ILIKE '%2006%';
  Result: no rows returned

- Query D: Check specifically for September 2006
  SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Vernal Ladies%' AND (date ILIKE '%September%2006%' OR date ILIKE '%Sept%2006%' OR date ILIKE '%sep%2006%');
  Result: no rows returned

Findings:
- The database shows a “Vernal Ladies” tournament with a winning score of 203, but the date is 15 May 2005, not September 2006.
- There are no entries indicating a “Vernal Ladies” event in 2006 or in September 2006.

Conclusion:
- The “203” winning score for the Vernal Ladies tournament is supported by the data.
- The timing (“September 2006”) is contradicted by the data, which shows the event dated 15 May 2005.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the “Vernal Ladies” tournament as listed in the ai_miyazato table of the TabFact database, treated as authoritative for this verification.
- Dates are stored as free-form text in this dataset; I used case-insensitive substring matches (ILIKE) to identify year/month references.
