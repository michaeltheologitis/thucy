Claim: “the chicago bull be the only teamn to play the boston celtic in boston garden and win.”

Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and found one NBA-related table: a game-by-game record for the 1984–85 Boston Celtics season.
- Interpreted “play … in Boston Garden and win” as: away teams defeating the Celtics in games where location = “boston garden.”
- Verified whether the Chicago Bulls both: (a) won at Boston Garden, and (b) were the only such winner.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season (columns: game, date, opponent, score, location, record)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify how home games are represented (distinct location values)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT location FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season ORDER BY location;
Result:
[{"location":"boston garden"},{"location":"brendan byrne arena"},{"location":"hartford civic center"},{"location":"madison square garden"},{"location":"market square arena"},{"location":"the omni"},{"location":"the spectrum"}]
Interpretation: Games at “boston garden” are Celtics home games.

2) List all games played at Boston Garden
SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, score, location, record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE location = 'boston garden' ORDER BY game;
Result:
[{"date":"fri jan 4","game":34,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"new york knicks","record":"28 - 6","score":"105 - 94"},
 {"date":"wed jan 9","game":36,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"chicago bulls","record":"30 - 6","score":"111 - 108"},
 {"date":"fri jan 11","game":37,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"washington bullets","record":"31 - 6","score":"103 - 101"},
 {"date":"wed jan 16","game":39,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"los angeles lakers","record":"33 - 6","score":"104 - 102"},
 {"date":"sun jan 20","game":41,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"philadelphia 76ers","record":"34 - 7","score":"113 - 97"},
 {"date":"wed jan 23","game":42,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"seattle supersonics","record":"34 - 8","score":"97 - 107"},
 {"date":"fri jan 25","game":43,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"indiana pacers","record":"35 - 8","score":"125 - 94"},
 {"date":"sun jan 27","game":44,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"portland trail blazers","record":"36 - 8","score":"128 - 127"}]
Interpretation: These are the Boston Garden games captured in this table. The score string is in “CelticsPoints - OpponentPoints” order.

3) Extract Boston Garden games where Celtics lost (home losses)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, location
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE location = 'boston garden'
  AND split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int < split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int
ORDER BY game;
Result:
[{"date":"wed jan 23","location":"boston garden","opponent":"seattle supersonics","score":"97 - 107"}]
Interpretation: In the data available, the Celtics lost at Boston Garden to the Seattle SuperSonics.

4) Specifically check Chicago Bulls games and whether any was a Celtics home loss
SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, score, location, record FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%bulls%';
Result:
[{"date":"wed jan 9","game":36,"location":"boston garden","opponent":"chicago bulls","record":"30 - 6","score":"111 - 108"}]

SQL:
SELECT date, location, score,
       split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int AS celtics_points,
       split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int AS opponent_points,
       (lower(location) = 'boston garden' AND split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int < split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int) AS home_loss
FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%bulls%';
Result:
[{"celtics_points":111,"date":"wed jan 9","home_loss":false,"location":"boston garden","opponent_points":108,"score":"111 - 108"}]
Interpretation: The Celtics defeated the Chicago Bulls 111–108 at Boston Garden in this dataset; the Bulls did not record a win there in the available rows.

Findings
- The dataset shows at least one non-Bulls opponent (Seattle SuperSonics) winning at Boston Garden.
- The Chicago Bulls game at Boston Garden in this data was a Celtics win (i.e., Bulls did not win there in the available entries).

Conclusion
- The claim that the Chicago Bulls were the only team to play the Boston Celtics in Boston Garden and win is contradicted by the available evidence. Within the 1984–85 season data present, the SuperSonics won at Boston Garden, and the Bulls did not.

Assumptions and limitations
- Available data covers a single table (t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season) with a subset of the 1984–85 season; no broader historical database was accessible via the tools. Conclusions are grounded strictly in this dataset.
- Interpreted “Boston Garden” as location = 'boston garden' and determined outcomes by parsing the score as “CelticsPoints - OpponentPoints,” which is consistent with the table’s rows.
