Assessment
- The claim requires the number of Bears’ losses to Packers to be greater than 10.
- The authoritative dataset available shows 5 such losses.
- Therefore, within this data environment, the claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions made
- Team names are matched case-insensitively; the table stores them in lowercase (e.g., "chicago bears", "green bay packers").
- The verification is scoped strictly to the available public.bears_packers_rivalry dataset, treated as authoritative per instructions.
