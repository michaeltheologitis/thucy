Claim to verify: “Ecurie Espadon is the entrant when Talbot - Lago is the constructor and Talbot - Lago T26C is the chassis.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: postgres_tabfact4 (TabFact), public schema
- Table discovered: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix with columns (driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, tyre)

Step 1 — Identify exact constructor and chassis strings used in the data
- SQL executed (constructors and counts):
  SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  GROUP BY constructor
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, constructor;
  Result:
  - maserati: 8
  - talbot - lago: 6
  - ferrari: 4
  - alfa romeo: 3
  - sva - fiat: 1

- SQL executed (distinct chassis values):
  SELECT DISTINCT chassis FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  ORDER BY chassis;
  Result includes:
  - talbot - lago t26c
  - talbot - lago t26c - da
  (and others)

Step 2 — Check entrants for rows where constructor = 'talbot - lago' and chassis = 'talbot - lago t26c'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT driver, entrant, constructor, chassis
  FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  WHERE constructor = 'talbot - lago' AND chassis = 'talbot - lago t26c';
  Results:
  1) driver: johnny claes, entrant: ecurie belge, constructor: talbot - lago, chassis: talbot - lago t26c
  2) driver: philippe étancelin, entrant: private, constructor: talbot - lago, chassis: talbot - lago t26c
  3) driver: harry schell, entrant: ecurie bleue, constructor: talbot - lago, chassis: talbot - lago t26c

Observation: None of these rows list 'ecurie espadon' as the entrant.

Step 3 — Verify whether 'ecurie espadon' appears at all and, if so, with which constructor/chassis
- SQL executed (distinct entrants):
  SELECT DISTINCT entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix ORDER BY entrant;
  Result includes 'ecurie espadon'.

- SQL executed (mapping for that entrant):
  SELECT DISTINCT constructor, chassis FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant ILIKE 'ecurie espadon';
  Result:
  - constructor: sva - fiat; chassis: sva 1500

Conclusion
- The data show that when constructor = 'talbot - lago' and chassis = 'talbot - lago t26c', the entrants are 'ecurie belge', 'private', and 'ecurie bleue'—not 'ecurie espadon'.
- 'Ecurie espadon' does appear in the event, but with constructor 'sva - fiat' and chassis 'sva 1500'.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix table.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the entries recorded in the table public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix (1950 Swiss Grand Prix) discovered in the connected data source.
- Matching used the exact strings present in the data (lowercase, spacing around hyphens), as revealed by the distinct-value queries above.
