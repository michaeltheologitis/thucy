Claim: The 1962 VFL season was played by a total of 12 different teams.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public. Relevant table detected: public.t_1962_vfl_season.

Schema inspection (public.t_1962_vfl_season):
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text). No PK/FKs.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Count distinct teams across both home and away team fields (normalized by TRIM and UPPER):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS distinct_team_count FROM (
  SELECT UPPER(TRIM("home team")) AS team
  FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("home team") <> ''
  UNION
  SELECT UPPER(TRIM("away team")) AS team
  FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
  WHERE "away team" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("away team") <> ''
) AS teams;
- Result: distinct_team_count = 12

2) List the distinct normalized team names (alphabetically):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(TRIM("home team")) AS team
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("home team") <> ''
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT UPPER(TRIM("away team")) AS team
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE "away team" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("away team") <> ''
ORDER BY team;
- Resulting teams: CARLTON; COLLINGWOOD; ESSENDON; FITZROY; FOOTSCRAY; GEELONG; HAWTHORN; MELBOURNE; NORTH MELBOURNE; RICHMOND; SOUTH MELBOURNE; ST KILDA.

Conclusion: The database shows exactly 12 distinct teams participated in the 1962 VFL season, confirming the claim.

Assumptions:
- Team name normalization used UPPER(TRIM(name)); NULL/empty entries (if any) were excluded. No deduplication beyond trimming and case normalization was necessary.
