Claim interpreted: “Only one match resulted in a draw.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact34
- Schema: public
- Table: public.tim_lajcik (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)

Evidence
1) Distinct outcome counts in the res column
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.tim_lajcik GROUP BY res ORDER BY count DESC, res;
- Result:
  - res = 'win' — 7
  - res = 'loss' — 6
  - res = 'draw' — 1

2) Details of the draw match
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE res = 'draw';
- Result:
  - opponent: ron waterman; event: ufc 22; method: draw; round: 3; time: 5:00

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one row with res = 'draw'. This supports the claim that only one match resulted in a draw.

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to rows in public.tim_lajcik (Tim Lajcik’s fight records).
- “Draw” is identified by res exactly equal to 'draw'.
- Evaluation is over the entire table in the available dataset.
