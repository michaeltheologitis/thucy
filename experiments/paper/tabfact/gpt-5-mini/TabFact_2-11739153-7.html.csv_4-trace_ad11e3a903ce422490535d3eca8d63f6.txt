Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL: TabFact (public schema)
  - Table: t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
    - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

What I checked
- Identify how often each value appears in the decision column for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season table, focusing on “backstrom” and “harding”.
- Compute both the difference and ratio between the counts to evaluate alternative readings of “11 time(s) more than”.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Count each distinct decision value
SQL:
SELECT decision, COUNT(*) AS count FROM t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season GROUP BY decision ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- decision = backstrom → count = 11
- decision = harding  → count = 3

2) Compute counts, difference, and ratio
SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'backstrom' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS backstrom_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'harding' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS harding_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'backstrom' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'harding' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS difference,
  CASE WHEN SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'harding' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) = 0 THEN NULL
       ELSE (SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'backstrom' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END))::numeric / SUM(CASE WHEN decision = 'harding' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  END AS ratio
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
Result:
- backstrom_count = 11
- harding_count = 3
- difference = 8
- ratio ≈ 3.6667

Assessment of the claim
- The table shows “decision = backstrom” in 11 rows and “decision = harding” in 3 rows. So “backstrom” appears 11 times and appears more often than “harding.”
- If the claim is interpreted literally as “Backstrom appears 11 times more than Harding” (i.e., either 11 more than or 11× as many):
  - 11 more than: would require backstrom_count − harding_count = 11; actual difference is 8.
  - 11 times as many: would require ratio = 11; actual ratio ≈ 3.67.
- Therefore, the data supports that Backstrom appears 11 times and more often than Harding, but not that Backstrom appears “11 more than” or “11 times as many” as Harding.

Conclusion
- Supported elements: Backstrom appears 11 times in the decision column and appears more often than Harding.
- Not supported: The specific comparative “11 time(s) more than” reading (either as difference or multiplicative comparison).

Assumptions made
- I interpreted the relevant data as the table t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season and its decision column, treating it as authoritative for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season in this dataset.
- I evaluated multiple common meanings of “11 time(s) more than”: as an absolute difference and as a multiplicative comparison.
