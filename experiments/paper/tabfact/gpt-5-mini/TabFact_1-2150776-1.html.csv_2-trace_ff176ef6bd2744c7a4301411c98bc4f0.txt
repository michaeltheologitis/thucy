Claim to verify: "on jun 16, 1996, jeff gordon drive for hendrick motorsports"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact13), schema public.

Relevant schema identified:
- Table: public.pocono_400
  - Key columns for this check: year (bigint), date (text), driver (text), team (text)

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, date, driver, team FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE year = 1996 AND driver ILIKE '%Jeff Gordon%';
- Result:
  - year: 1996
  - date: june 16
  - driver: jeff gordon
  - team: hendrick motorsports

Analysis:
- The row for year 1996 and driver Jeff Gordon shows date = "june 16" and team = "hendrick motorsports". Combining the text date with the year confirms June 16, 1996. This directly supports the claim that on June 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon drove for Hendrick Motorsports.

Assumptions:
- The table stores the day and month as text ("june 16") and the year separately; combined they represent the full date June 16, 1996.
- The lowercase text in the table corresponds to proper names (e.g., "jeff gordon" -> Jeff Gordon; "hendrick motorsports" -> Hendrick Motorsports).
