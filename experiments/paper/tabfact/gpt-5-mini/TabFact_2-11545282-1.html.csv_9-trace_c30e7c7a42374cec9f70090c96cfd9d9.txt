Claim to verify: “after 1985, the united state contribute 2 player with rafael araãjo be the most recent.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single relational source: postgres_tabfact18 (public schema) containing table utah_jazz_all_time_roster.

Understanding the table (sampling rows)
- Purpose: Confirm columns, see whether Rafael Araãjo appears, and inspect data format for years.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, nationality, position, "years for jazz", "school / club team"
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  LIMIT 15;
- Key returned rows (9 total rows in table):
  1) rick adelman — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 1974 - 75
  2) john amaechi — nationality: england — years for jazz: 2001 - 03
  3) louis amundson — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 2007
  4) j j anderson — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 1982 - 85
  5) shandon anderson — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 1996 - 99
  6) rafael araãjo — nationality: brazil — years for jazz: 2006 - 2007
  7) carlos arroyo — nationality: puerto rico — years for jazz: 2002 - 05
  8) isaac austin — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 1991 - 93
  9) anthony avent — nationality: united states — years for jazz: 1998 - 99

Compute counts after 1985 by nationality and identify most recent player per nationality
- Method: Parse the start year as the first 4-digit year in the “years for jazz” field; define “after 1985” as start_year > 1985.
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT
      player,
      nationality,
      (substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})'))::int AS start_year
    FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
    WHERE substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
  )
  SELECT
    nationality,
    COUNT(*) AS player_count,
    MAX(start_year) AS max_start_year
  FROM parsed
  WHERE start_year > 1985
  GROUP BY nationality
  ORDER BY player_count DESC;
- Result:
  - united states: player_count = 4, max_start_year = 2007
  - puerto rico: player_count = 1, max_start_year = 2002
  - england: player_count = 1, max_start_year = 2001
  - brazil: player_count = 1, max_start_year = 2006

Identify who is “most recent” for each nationality
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT
      player,
      nationality,
      (substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})'))::int AS start_year
    FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
    WHERE substring("years for jazz" FROM '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
  ), agg AS (
    SELECT
      nationality,
      COUNT(*) AS player_count,
      MAX(start_year) AS max_start_year
    FROM parsed
    WHERE start_year > 1985
    GROUP BY nationality
  )
  SELECT
    agg.nationality,
    agg.player_count,
    p.player AS most_recent_player,
    p.start_year AS most_recent_start_year
  FROM agg
  JOIN parsed p
    ON p.nationality = agg.nationality
    AND p.start_year = agg.max_start_year
  ORDER BY agg.nationality;
- Result highlights:
  - united states: most recent = louis amundson (start 2007), player_count = 4
  - brazil: most recent = rafael araãjo (start 2006), player_count = 1

List of United States players after 1985 (for transparency)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, "years for jazz",
         substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})') AS start_year_text,
         CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})') AS INTEGER) AS start_year
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE lower(nationality) = 'united states'
    AND substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})') IS NOT NULL
    AND CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '([0-9]{4})') AS INTEGER) > 1985
  ORDER BY start_year ASC, player;
- Result:
  - isaac austin — 1991 - 93 — start_year 1991
  - shandon anderson — 1996 - 99 — start_year 1996
  - anthony avent — 1998 - 99 — start_year 1998
  - louis amundson — 2007 — start_year 2007

Assessment of the claim
- The data show that after 1985, United States players in this table number 4 (Austin, S. Anderson, Avent, Amundson), not 2.
- The most recent United States player (by start year) is Louis Amundson (2007), not Rafael Araãjo.
- Rafael Araãjo’s nationality in the table is Brazil, and his start year is 2006.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “after 1985” interpreted as start_year > 1985, where start_year is the first four-digit year parsed from the “years for jazz” field.
- “united state” interpreted as the nationality value “united states” in the table.
- Context is the Utah Jazz all-time roster table provided (note: this table only includes nine “A”-surname entries, which is the entirety of the available data here).
