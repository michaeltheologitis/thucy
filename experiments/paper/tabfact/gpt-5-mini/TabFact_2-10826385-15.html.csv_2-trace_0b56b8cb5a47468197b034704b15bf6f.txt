Objective
- Verify whether the crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was smaller than the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game, using available authoritative data sources.

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: tabfact3 (Postgres), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1972_vfl_season

Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Fitzroy vs North Melbourne matches (either home/away order)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
  WHERE ("home team" = 'fitzroy' AND "away team" = 'north melbourne') OR ("home team" = 'north melbourne' AND "away team" = 'fitzroy')
  ORDER BY "date", "home team";
- Result row:
  - Date: 15 july 1972 | Home team: fitzroy | Away team: north melbourne | Venue: junction oval | Crowd: 7007

2) Essendon vs Richmond matches (either home/away order)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
  WHERE ("home team" = 'essendon' AND "away team" = 'richmond') OR ("home team" = 'richmond' AND "away team" = 'essendon')
  ORDER BY "date", "home team";
- Result row:
  - Date: 15 july 1972 | Home team: essendon | Away team: richmond | Venue: windy hill | Crowd: 22251

Analysis
- In the 1972 VFL season data, the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne match (15 July 1972) had a crowd of 7,007.
- The Essendon vs Richmond match (15 July 1972) had a crowd of 22,251.
- Comparison: 7,007 < 22,251. Therefore, the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne crowd was smaller than the Essendon vs Richmond crowd in the observed data.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the 1972 season data available: the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne crowd was smaller than the Essendon vs Richmond crowd.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the available dataset (VFL 1972 season). Team names are matched exactly as stored (lowercase). If the claim intended a different season or match, that is outside the scope of the accessible data; within 1972, the comparison holds.
