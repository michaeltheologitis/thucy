Claim to verify: "the jazz have at least 3 guard that be on the team during 1979 - 80 , 1 be james donaldson"

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema)
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster(player text, nationality text, position text, "years for jazz" text, "school / club team" text)

Step 1: Understand data format
Executed SQL (sample rows):
SELECT player, nationality, position, "years for jazz", "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster LIMIT 20;

Observed relevant rows among the 8-row table include:
- adrian dantley | position: guard - forward | years for jazz: 1979 - 86
- brad davis     | position: guard           | years for jazz: 1979 - 80
- paul dawkins   | position: guard           | years for jazz: 1979 - 80
- greg deane     | position: guard           | years for jazz: 1979 - 80
- james donaldson| position: center          | years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95

Step 2: Verify whether there were at least three guards on the Jazz during 1979–80
Executed SQL (list guards with 1979 in their Jazz years):
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%' AND position ILIKE '%guard%';

Result:
- adrian dantley | guard - forward | 1979 - 86
- brad davis     | guard           | 1979 - 80
- paul dawkins   | guard           | 1979 - 80
- greg deane     | guard           | 1979 - 80

Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%' AND position ILIKE '%guard%';

Result:
- count: 4

Conclusion for part 1: Supported. There are at least three players with a guard role on the Jazz during the 1979–80 season (in fact, four in this dataset).

Step 3: Check whether James Donaldson was one of those guards and whether he was on the Jazz in 1979–80
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE 'James Donaldson';

Result:
- james donaldson | center | 1993 , 1994 - 95

Conclusion for part 2: Not supported. James Donaldson is listed as a center, with Jazz years 1993 and 1994–95; he is not on the Jazz in 1979–80 and is not a guard in this dataset.

Overall assessment
- Part 1 (at least three guards on the team during 1979–80): True, based on the returned rows and count.
- Part 2 (one of them is James Donaldson): False, as per the roster data.

Final conclusion: The claim mixes a correct statement with an incorrect one.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “on the team during 1979–80” as any player whose "years for jazz" includes 1979 (e.g., '1979 - 80' or '1979 - 86').
- Treated any position containing the substring 'guard' (e.g., 'guard', 'guard - forward') as a guard role.
