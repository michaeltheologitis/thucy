Claim interpreted: “Alberto Pagani averaged 40 points in races he won in the 250cc class.” I verified two core parts: (a) whether he had wins in the 250cc class, and (b) whether any relevant average (season points, given the data available) equals 40 in that context.

Data source overview
- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15)
- Table: public.alberto_pagani (year bigint, class text, team text, points bigint, wins bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full dataset preview (shows classes, points, and wins per season)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, class, team, points, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Key rows (wins > 0):
- 1969 | 500cc | linto | points: 15 | wins: 1
- 1971 | 500cc | linto | points: 29 | wins: 1
- 1971 | 500cc | mv agusta | points: 29 | wins: 1
- 1972 | 500cc | mv agusta | points: 87 | wins: 1
Observation: All seasons with wins are in the 500cc class; there are no 250cc wins in the table.

2) Did Alberto Pagani have any wins in the 250cc class?
SQL executed:
SELECT COALESCE(SUM(wins), 0) AS total_wins_250cc
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE class = '250cc';
Result: total_wins_250cc = 0
Conclusion: He had 0 wins in the 250cc class in this dataset.

3) Average points in 250cc seasons
SQL executed (list seasons to show source values):
SELECT year, class, points FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' ORDER BY year;
Returned points by season (9 seasons): 2, 0, 8, 6, 1, 4, 0, 4, 0
SQL executed (compute average across those seasons):
SELECT AVG(points) AS average_points, COUNT(*) AS seasons FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc';
Result: average_points = 2.7777777777777778 (≈ 2.78), seasons = 9
Conclusion: His average season points in 250cc is about 2.78, not 40.

4) For context only: Average points in seasons where he had at least one win (any class)
SQL executed (overall average for seasons with wins >= 1):
SELECT AVG(points)::numeric AS avg_points FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins >= 1;
Result: avg_points = 40.0000000000000000
SQL executed (class breakdown for those seasons):
SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS seasons_with_win, SUM(wins) AS total_wins, AVG(points)::numeric AS avg_points_per_season
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE wins >= 1
GROUP BY class
ORDER BY class;
Result: class = 500cc | seasons_with_win = 4 | total_wins = 4 | avg_points_per_season = 40.0000000000000000
Conclusion: The “40 points” average applies to seasons with at least one win, and exclusively in the 500cc class—not 250cc.

Findings
- The data shows Alberto Pagani had zero wins in the 250cc class (contradicting the claim that he “win in the 250cc class”).
- His average season points in the 250cc class is about 2.78, not 40.
- The only place a 40-point average appears is when averaging season points across seasons where he had at least one win, all of which are in the 500cc class—this does not support the claim as stated.

Conclusion
The claim is not supported. He did not have wins in the 250cc class, and his 250cc average points are far below 40. The “40-point average” pertains to seasons with wins in the 500cc class, not 250cc.

Assumptions due to ambiguity
- The dataset is season-level (one row per season/class/team) and does not include race-level results; therefore, I interpreted “average … in race” as “average season points” within the relevant subset.
- “250cc class” is matched exactly to rows where class = '250cc'.
- Conclusions are constrained to the data available in public.alberto_pagani, treated as authoritative per instructions.
