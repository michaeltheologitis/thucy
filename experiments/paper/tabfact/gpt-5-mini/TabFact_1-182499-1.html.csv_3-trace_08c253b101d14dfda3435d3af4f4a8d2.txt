Summary
The claim asserts that “the substrate uroporphyrinogen III and the product protoporphyrinogen IX” are on chromosome 10q25.2–q26.3. Using the available porphyrin/heme biosynthesis database, the evidence shows:
- The enzyme located at 10q25.2–q26.3 (UROS, uroporphyrinogen III synthase) produces uroporphyrinogen III from hydroxymethyl bilane—not protoporphyrinogen IX.
- The enzymatic steps involving uroporphyrinogen III as a substrate and protoporphyrinogen IX as a product are located on different chromosomes (1p34 and 3q12, respectively), not on 10q25.2–q26.3.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.porphyrin (columns: enzyme, location, substrate, product, chromosome, ec, omim, porphyria)

Executed SQL evidence
1) Identify records involving uroporphyrinogen III (as substrate) or protoporphyrinogen IX (as product)
SQL:
SELECT enzyme, location, chromosome, substrate, product FROM public.porphyrin
WHERE LOWER(substrate) = 'uroporphyrinogen iii' OR LOWER(product) = 'protoporphyrinogen ix';
Results:
- enzyme: uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase; chromosome: 1p34; location: cytosol; substrate: uroporphyrinogen iii; product: coproporphyrinogen iii
- enzyme: coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase; chromosome: 3q12; location: mitochondrion; substrate: coproporphyrinogen iii; product: protoporphyrinogen ix
Interpretation: UROD (1p34) uses uroporphyrinogen III as substrate; CPOX (3q12) produces protoporphyrinogen IX. Neither is on 10q25.2–q26.3.

2) Check enzymes containing “uroporphyrinogen” to find the 10q25.2–q26.3 mapping
SQL:
SELECT enzyme, substrate, product, chromosome FROM public.porphyrin WHERE enzyme ILIKE '%uroporphyrinogen%';
Results:
- uroporphyrinogen iii synthase; substrate: hydroxymethyl bilane; product: uroporphyrinogen iii; chromosome: 10q25.2 - q26.3
- uroporphyrinogen iii decarboxylase; substrate: uroporphyrinogen iii; product: coproporphyrinogen iii; chromosome: 1p34
Interpretation: The 10q25.2–q26.3 locus corresponds to UROS, which produces uroporphyrinogen III (it is not the step producing protoporphyrinogen IX, and uroporphyrinogen III is not merely a “substrate” at this locus).

3) Confirm loci for products protoporphyrinogen IX and protoporphyrin IX
SQL:
SELECT enzyme, chromosome, product FROM public.porphyrin WHERE lower(trim(product)) IN ('protoporphyrin ix','protoporphyrinogen ix');
Results:
- coproporphyrinogen iii oxidase — 3q12 — protoporphyrinogen ix
- protoporphyrinogen oxidase — 1q22 — protoporphyrin ix
Interpretation: Protoporphyrinogen IX is generated by CPOX at 3q12; protoporphyrin IX is generated by PPOX at 1q22. Neither maps to 10q25.2–q26.3.

Conclusion
- The locus 10q25.2–q26.3 corresponds to uroporphyrinogen III synthase (UROS), which produces uroporphyrinogen III from hydroxymethyl bilane.
- The step where uroporphyrinogen III is a substrate (UROD) is at 1p34, and the step producing protoporphyrinogen IX (CPOX) is at 3q12.
- Therefore, the claim that uroporphyrinogen III (as substrate) and protoporphyrinogen IX (as product) are on chromosome 10q25.2–q26.3 is not supported by the data and is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the chromosomal location of genes encoding enzymes responsible for the respective substrate/product steps in heme biosynthesis, since metabolites themselves are not located on chromosomes.
- Case-insensitive matching was used for textual fields.
