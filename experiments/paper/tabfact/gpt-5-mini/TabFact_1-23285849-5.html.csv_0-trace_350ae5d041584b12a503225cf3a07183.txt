SQL:
SELECT game, date, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists" FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'Nov%';
Result (rows):
[{"date":"november 1","game":3,"high assists":"chauncey billups (12)","high points":"carmelo anthony (42)","high rebounds":"nenê (9)"},{"date":"november 3","game":4,"high assists":"anthony carter (5)","high points":"carmelo anthony (25)","high rebounds":"nenê (13)"},{"date":"november 4","game":5,"high assists":"chauncey billups (5)","high points":"ty lawson (23)","high rebounds":"kenyon martin (10)"},{"date":"november 7","game":7,"high assists":"chauncey billups (7)","high points":"carmelo anthony (30)","high rebounds":"chris andersen (11)"},{"date":"november 10","game":8,"high assists":"chauncey billups (6)","high points":"carmelo anthony (20)","high rebounds":"nenê (12)"},{"date":"november 11","game":9,"high assists":"chauncey billups , ty lawson (5)","high points":"carmelo anthony (32)","high rebounds":"carmelo anthony (10)"},{"date":"november 13","game":10,"high assists":"chauncey billups (8)","high points":"carmelo anthony (25)","high rebounds":"chris andersen (11)"},{"date":"november 17","game":11,"high assists":"chauncey billups (10)","high points":"carmelo anthony (32)","high rebounds":"nenê (10)"},{"date":"november 20","game":12,"high assists":"chauncey billups (7)","high points":"carmelo anthony (37)","high rebounds":"nenê (12)"},{"date":"november 21","game":13,"high assists":"carmelo anthony (7)","high points":"carmelo anthony (30)","high rebounds":"carmelo anthony , kenyon martin (11)"},{"date":"november 24","game":14,"high assists":"chauncey billups (7)","high points":"carmelo anthony (27)","high rebounds":"nenê (9)"},{"date":"november 25","game":15,"high assists":"nenê , ty lawson (6)","high points":"carmelo anthony (22)","high rebounds":"nenê (8)"},{"date":"november 27","game":16,"high assists":"chauncey billups (8)","high points":"carmelo anthony (50)","high rebounds":"nenê , kenyon martin (11)"}]
Observation: Of the 13 November games listed above, Ty Lawson led once (Nov 4); Carmelo Anthony led the other 12.

2) Count total November games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'Nov%';
Result:
[{"count":13}]

3) Count November games where Carmelo Anthony was the high points leader
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'Nov%' AND "high points" ILIKE '%carmelo%';
Result:
[{"count":12}]

4) List any November games where the high points leader was not Carmelo Anthony
SQL:
SELECT date, "high points" FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'Nov%' AND "high points" NOT ILIKE '%carmelo%' ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date":"november 4","high points":"ty lawson (23)"}]

Conclusion
- The data shows 13 Nuggets games in November, with Carmelo Anthony as the high points leader in 12 of them. The only exception is November 4 (Ty Lawson with 23). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to November of the 2009–10 season, consistent with the available Nuggets season table.
- Treated the "high points" field as the Nuggets’ team leading scorer for each game (consistent with the table’s scope and other columns).
