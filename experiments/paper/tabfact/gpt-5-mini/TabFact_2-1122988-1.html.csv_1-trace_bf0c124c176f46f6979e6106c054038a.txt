Interpretation of the claim:
- I interpret “when the grid be 5, the least amount of lap be 43.0” as: In the table of interest, among entries with grid = 5, the minimum value of the laps column is 43 (43.0 as a formatting variant).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix(driver text, constructor text, laps bigint, "time / retired" text, grid bigint)

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Minimum laps for grid = 5
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 5;
- Result: { min_laps: 43 }

2) All rows with grid = 5 (for context)
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 5;
- Result:
  { driver: "michele alboreto", constructor: "ferrari", laps: 43, "time / retired": "engine" }

Assessment:
- The minimum laps for entries with grid = 5 is 43. The claim states 43.0; this is consistent apart from numeric formatting.

Assumptions:
- “least amount of lap” refers to the minimum value of the laps column among rows where grid = 5 in the table t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix.
