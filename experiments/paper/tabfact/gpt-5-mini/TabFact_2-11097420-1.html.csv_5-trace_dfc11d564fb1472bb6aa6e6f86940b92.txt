Claim to verify: “all 3 of the complete project be complete between 1993 - 1997.”

Interpretation of the claim:
- “complete project” is interpreted as sites whose “construction completed” field indicates a completion date (i.e., it contains a 4-digit year).
- The claim asserts there are exactly three such completed sites and that all of them have completion years between 1993 and 1997 (inclusive).

Data sources discovered:
- One PostgreSQL data source (TabFact). Relevant table in public schema: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi.

Schema details consulted:
- Table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  - Columns (all text): cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted.

Evidence
1) Initial exploration of “construction completed” values
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "construction completed" AS construction_completed, substring("construction completed" FROM '([0-9]{4})') AS year_extracted
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE "construction completed" IS NOT NULL AND trim("construction completed") <> '';

Key output rows:
- flowood site | 09 / 17 / 1993 | 1993
- newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc | 08 / 08 / 1997 | 1997
- walcotte chemical co warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982 | 1982
- Several other rows had a placeholder '-' and no year extracted (NULL).

2) Formal verification queries
a) Total number of sites with a 4-digit year in the “construction completed” field
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_construction_completed_sites
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL;

Output: total_construction_completed_sites = 3

b) List those sites and their extracted year
Executed SQL:
SELECT name,
       "construction completed" AS completion_text,
       substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') AS extracted_year
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY name;

Output:
- flowood site | 09 / 17 / 1993 | 1993
- newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc | 08 / 08 / 1997 | 1997
- walcotte chemical co warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982 | 1982

c) Min and max of the extracted completion years
Executed SQL:
SELECT min((substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})'))::int) AS min_year,
       max((substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})'))::int) AS max_year
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL;

Output: min_year = 1982, max_year = 1997

d) Count of such sites with years between 1993 and 1997 (inclusive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count_between_1993_1997
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL
  AND (substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})'))::int BETWEEN 1993 AND 1997;

Output: count_between_1993_1997 = 2

e) Count with years outside 1993–1997
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS count_outside_1993_1997
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})') IS NOT NULL
  AND ((substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})'))::int < 1993
       OR (substring("construction completed" FROM '(\d{4})'))::int > 1997);

Output: count_outside_1993_1997 = 1

Findings:
- There are exactly three sites with a valid completion year (1982, 1993, 1997).
- Only two of them fall within 1993–1997 inclusive; one is from 1982.

Conclusion:
- The claim that “all 3 of the complete project be complete between 1993 - 1997” is contradicted by the data. Of the three completed sites, one (walcotte chemical co warehouses) was completed in 1982, outside the specified range.

Assumptions made:
- “Complete project” corresponds to sites where the “construction completed” field contains a 4-digit year (ignoring placeholder values like ‘-’).
- The year range 1993–1997 is interpreted as inclusive.
- Only the Mississippi Superfund sites table was considered, as it is the sole available relevant dataset.
