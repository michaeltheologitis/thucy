Claim to verify: "larry mize and scott simpson be tie for 5th place"

Data sources consulted:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par)

Evidence gathered (executed SQL and results):
1) Full leaderboard entries for the table
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf;
Key returned rows (country | place | player | score | to par):
- united states | 1  | curtis strange  | 70 + 67 + 69 = 206 | - 7
- england       | t2 | nick faldo      | 72 + 67 + 68 = 207 | - 6
- united states | t2 | bob gilder      | 68 + 69 + 70 = 207 | - 6
- united states | t2 | scott simpson   | 69 + 66 + 72 = 207 | - 6
- united states | t5 | larry mize      | 69 + 67 + 72 = 208 | - 5
- united states | t5 | d a weibring    | 71 + 69 + 68 = 208 | - 5

2) Directly check Larry Mize and Scott Simpson
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'larry mize' OR player ILIKE 'scott simpson';
Results:
- united states | t2 | scott simpson | 69 + 66 + 72 = 207 | - 6
- united states | t5 | larry mize    | 69 + 67 + 72 = 208 | - 5

Findings:
- Larry Mize is tied for 5th place (place = 't5').
- Scott Simpson is tied for 2nd place (place = 't2'), not tied for 5th.

Conclusion: The claim that both Larry Mize and Scott Simpson are tied for 5th place is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1988 U.S. Open golf leaderboard, which is the available authoritative dataset. Ties are denoted by a 't' prefix in the 'place' column (e.g., 't5' = tied for 5th). Name matching was case-insensitive using ILIKE.
