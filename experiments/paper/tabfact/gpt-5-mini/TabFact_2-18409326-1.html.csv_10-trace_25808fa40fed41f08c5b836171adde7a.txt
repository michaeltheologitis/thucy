Claim interpreted: “Astral Media’s radio station has the call sign CJUI-FM.”

What the data shows
- The media_in_kelowna table lists a station with call sign “cjui - fm” (formatting and casing as stored), branded “103.9 the juice,” owned by “vista broadcast group,” not Astral Media.
- The only station in this dataset explicitly owned by “astral media” has the call sign “ckfr” (AM 1150), branded “am 1150.”

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) List all stations to see ownership and call signs
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
Results excerpt:
- …
- frequency: 0 103.9 fm | call sign: cjui - fm | branding: 103.9 the juice | format: adult hits | owner: vista broadcast group
- …
- frequency: 1150 am | call sign: ckfr | branding: am 1150 | format: news / talk | owner: astral media

2) Find the station(s) owned by Astral Media
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner
FROM media_in_kelowna
WHERE owner ILIKE '%Astral%';
Result:
- frequency: 1150 am | call sign: ckfr | branding: am 1150 | format: news / talk | owner: astral media

3) Confirm the “CJUI” call sign row and its owner
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, owner
FROM media_in_kelowna
WHERE "call sign" ILIKE '%cjui%';
Result:
- frequency: 0 103.9 fm | call sign: cjui - fm | branding: 103.9 the juice | owner: vista broadcast group

Conclusion
- The call sign “CJUI-FM” (stored as “cjui - fm”) corresponds to a station owned by Vista Broadcast Group, not Astral Media. The Astral Media station in this dataset is CKFR. Therefore, the claim is false.

Assumptions
- “Astral Media’s radio station” refers to stations represented in the media_in_kelowna dataset.
- Minor differences in spacing/casing of call signs (e.g., “cjui - fm” vs “CJUI-FM”) are considered equivalent identifiers for verification purposes.
