Summary
- Based on the available media data for Kelowna, the station operating on 1150 AM (call sign: CKFR) uses the branding “AM 1150.” This supports the claim that “AM 1150” is the branding for the frequency 1150 AM (at least for this station and market in the provided dataset).

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact7), schema public, containing a single table: media_in_kelowna.
- Table structure (key fields): frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Query to directly match frequency 1150 AM (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(frequency) = '1150 am';
Result:
- frequency: 1150 am
- call sign: ckfr
- branding: am 1150

2) Query to find any entries whose frequency contains 1150 (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
WHERE frequency ILIKE '%1150%';
Result:
- frequency: 1150 am
  call sign: ckfr
  branding: am 1150

Conclusion
- The available data show that the 1150 AM frequency in Kelowna (CKFR) brands as “AM 1150.” This verifies the claim within the scope of the provided dataset.

Assumptions
- The question is interpreted as asking whether “AM 1150” is used as the branding for a station broadcasting on 1150 AM. With only the Kelowna media table available, conclusions are scoped to that market and dataset.
