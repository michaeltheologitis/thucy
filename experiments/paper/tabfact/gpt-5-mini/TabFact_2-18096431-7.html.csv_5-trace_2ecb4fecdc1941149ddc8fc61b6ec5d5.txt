Claim evaluated: “Kenny Perry [is] the player who earned the most money.”

Data source overview
- Available database: TabFact (Postgres). Relevant table discovered: public.t_1996_pga_championship(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text, money bigint). This table tracks players and prize money for the 1996 PGA Championship.

Evidence from data
1) Identify the maximum prize money awarded in the event
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(money) AS max_money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship;
Result:
max_money = 430000

2) Find the player(s) who received the maximum money
SQL executed:
SELECT player, place, money, score FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE money = (SELECT MAX(money) FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship) ORDER BY money DESC;
Result:
player = mark brooks, place = 1, money = 430000, score = 68 + 70 + 69 + 70 = 277

3) Locate Kenny Perry’s result and earnings
SQL executed:
SELECT place, player, money, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
WHERE player ILIKE 'Kenny Perry' OR player ILIKE 'Perry, Kenny' OR player ILIKE '%Kenny Perry%' OR player ILIKE '%Perry, Kenny%';
Result:
place = 2, player = kenny perry, money = 260000, score = 66 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 277, to par = - 11

4) Context: Top 5 earners in the event
SQL executed:
SELECT place, player, money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY money DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 5;
Result:
1 — mark brooks — 430000
2 — kenny perry — 260000
t3 — steve elkington — 140000
t3 — tommy tolles — 140000
t5 — justin leonard — 86667

Conclusion
- In the 1996 PGA Championship, the player who earned the most money was Mark Brooks ($430,000). Kenny Perry finished second with $260,000. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Because the only relevant available table concerns the 1996 PGA Championship, I interpret the claim as referring to this event’s prize money. The claim is not evaluated for other seasons or all-time earnings.
