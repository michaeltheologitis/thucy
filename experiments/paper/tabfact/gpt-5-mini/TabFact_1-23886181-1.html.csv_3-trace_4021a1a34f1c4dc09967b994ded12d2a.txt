Assessment
- Both entities—AC Sparta Prague and Team Netherlands—are recorded with continent = "europe" in the authoritative data source consulted.

Assumptions
- "Team Netherlands" refers to the entry named exactly "team netherlands" in the Superleague Formula-related table.
- "Located on the European continent" is taken to mean the value of the "continent" field in the referenced dataset is "europe" for the entities in question.
