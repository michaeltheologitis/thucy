Claim to verify: “In the episode ‘Ballroom and Biscotti’ of Gilmore Girls, the writer is Matthew Diamond.”

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (Postgres)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
  - Columns: "no" (bigint), "-" (bigint), "title" (text), "director" (text), "writer (s)" (text), "original air date" (text), "prod code" (bigint), "us viewers (million)" (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Inspect sample titles to confirm how the episode title is stored:
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT title FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes LIMIT 5;
   Observation: The episode appears in the table as “ballrooms and biscotti” (plural, lowercase).

2) Retrieve writer(s), director, and date for the episode containing “biscotti” in the title:
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT "title", "writer (s)", "director", "original air date" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE title ILIKE '%biscotti%';
   Result row:
   - title: "ballrooms and biscotti"
   - writer (s): "amy sherman - palladino"
   - director: "amy sherman - palladino"
   - original air date: "september 23 , 2003"

Conclusion:
- The data shows the writer is Amy Sherman-Palladino, not Matthew Diamond. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- The user’s “Ballroom and Biscotti” refers to the episode stored as “ballrooms and biscotti.”
- The TabFact Postgres table public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes is treated as authoritative for episode credits.
