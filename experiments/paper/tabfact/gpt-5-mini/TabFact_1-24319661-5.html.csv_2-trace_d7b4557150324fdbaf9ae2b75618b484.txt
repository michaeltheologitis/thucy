Claim being verified: “bcw410 be the production code for episode 10.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26), schema: public
- Table: list_of_white_collar_episodes — episode listings for the TV series “White Collar”

Relevant schema (as reported by the schema tool):
- Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check whether production code BCW410 exists and what episode number it maps to
- SQL:
  SELECT title, "no in series", "no in season", "production code"
  FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("production code") = 'bcw410';
- Result:
  title: vested interest; no in series: 56; no in season: 10; production code: bcw410
- Interpretation: The row with production code bcw410 corresponds to episode number 10 within its season ("no in season" = 10).

2) Directly confirm which production code corresponds to episode 10 within a season
- SQL:
  SELECT "title", "production code" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in season" = 10;
- Result:
  title: vested interest; production code: bcw410
- Interpretation: Episode 10 in-season has production code bcw410.

Additional context/consistency check (not required but included for clarity):
- The table contains entries with production codes bcw401 through bcw415 and "no in series" values 47–61, indicating it covers a contiguous run of episodes consistent with White Collar Season 4. This aligns with bcw410 corresponding to season 4, episode 10.
- SQL to list contents by overall numbering:
  SELECT "no in series", "title", "production code" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes ORDER BY "no in series";
  Returned rows included:
  ... 54 ancient history bcw408; 55 gloves off bcw409; 56 vested interest bcw410; 57 family business bcw411; ...

Conclusion:
- The production code bcw410 maps to the episode whose in-season number is 10. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- Interpreted “episode 10” as the in-season episode number (column "no in season").
- The dataset appears to cover White Collar Season 4 specifically; no explicit season column is present, but the production code pattern (bcw4xx) and contiguous overall numbering support this interpretation.
