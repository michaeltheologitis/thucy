Claim to verify: “interior loft be direct by ken wiederhorn and originally air on january 22 , 1990.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact11 (public schema). It includes a table of TV episodes for “Freddy’s Nightmares”.

Targeted evidence query and results:
- Purpose: Find any episode titled with the words “Interior” and “Loft,” and read its director and original airdate.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, season, series, "director (s)", "writer (s)", "original airdate"
  FROM list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes
  WHERE title ILIKE '%Interior%' AND title ILIKE '%Loft%';
- Result (relevant row):
  - title: interior loft
  - season: 15
  - series: 37
  - director (s): ken wiederhorn
  - writer (s): david braff
  - original airdate: january 22 , 1990

Analysis:
- The database explicitly lists an episode titled “interior loft” with director “ken wiederhorn” and original airdate “january 22 , 1990.” This directly matches the user’s claim.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the “interior loft” episode within the Freddy’s Nightmares episode list available in the postgres_tabfact11 public schema. The dataset uses lowercase titles and textual date formatting, which I accept as authoritative within this environment.
