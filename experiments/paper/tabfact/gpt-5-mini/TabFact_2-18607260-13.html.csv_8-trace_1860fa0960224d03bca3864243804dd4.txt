Answer
- Neither team scored; the first World Cup match (for Paraguay) in France ended 0-0.

Assumptions
- “World Cup in France” refers to the 1998 FIFA World Cup (hosted in France).
- “First game” is interpreted as Paraguay’s first match at that World Cup, because the available dataset (t_1998_in_paraguayan_football) contains Paraguay’s 1998 fixtures, including World Cup matches.
- “Neither team score” is interpreted as a final scoreline of 0-0.
