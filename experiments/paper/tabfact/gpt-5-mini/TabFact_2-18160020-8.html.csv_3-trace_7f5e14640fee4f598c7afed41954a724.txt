Claim to verify: “miguel zapata have the fewest number of goal with 17.”

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact34 (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b with columns: goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision), team (text).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Find the minimum goals value
SQL:
SELECT MIN(goals) AS min_goals FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b;
Result:
- min_goals = 17

2) List goalkeeper(s) with the minimum goals
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE goals = (SELECT MIN(goals) FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b) ORDER BY goalkeeper;
Result rows:
- goalkeeper: "miguel zapata", goals: 17

3) Check for goalkeeper named ‘Miguel Zapata’ (case-insensitive) and report goals
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(goalkeeper) = LOWER('Miguel Zapata');
Result rows:
- goalkeeper: "miguel zapata", goals: 17

Conclusion:
- The minimum number of goals in the table is 17, and the goalkeeper with that minimum is “miguel zapata.” The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Name matching performed case-insensitively ("miguel zapata" matches “Miguel Zapata”).
- “Fewest number of goal” is interpreted as the minimum value in the “goals” column for goalkeepers in this table.
