Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: For the period labeled “1995 - 2000”, life expectancy is less than 61.5 and the infant mortality rate (IMR) is exactly 27.
- Data source explored: TabFact (postgres_tabfact2), public schema.
- Relevant table/columns: public.my_info_table with columns period (text), imr (bigint), "life expectancy total" (double precision), "life expectancy males" (double precision), "life expectancy females" (double precision).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify how the 1995–2000 period is encoded
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT period FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period LIKE '%1995%' OR period LIKE '%2000%' ORDER BY period;
- Result:
  - 1990 - 1995
  - 1995 - 2000
  - 2000 - 2005
  This confirms the period label “1995 - 2000” exists in the data.

2) Retrieve IMR and total life expectancy for the period “1995 - 2000”
- SQL:
  SELECT period, imr, "life expectancy total" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '1995 - 2000';
- Result:
  - period: 1995 - 2000
  - imr: 34
  - life expectancy total: 69.3
  Comparison to claim:
  - IMR is 34 (not exactly 27)
  - Life expectancy total is 69.3 (not less than 61.5)

3) Cross-check male and female life expectancy for completeness
- SQL:
  SELECT period, imr, "life expectancy total", "life expectancy males", "life expectancy females" 
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE period = '1995 - 2000';
- Result:
  - period: 1995 - 2000
  - imr: 34
  - life expectancy total: 69.3
  - life expectancy males: 65.5
  - life expectancy females: 73.3
  Both male and female life expectancy values are also greater than 61.5, and IMR remains 34.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim. For the period “1995 - 2000”, the recorded IMR is 34 (not 27) and life expectancy (total) is 69.3 (greater than 61.5). Therefore, the stated conditions do not hold in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Life expectancy” refers to the column "life expectancy total" unless otherwise specified.
- The period in the claim corresponds to the exact text label “1995 - 2000” found in the period column.
- The TabFact (postgres_tabfact2) database is treated as authoritative for this verification per the instructions.
