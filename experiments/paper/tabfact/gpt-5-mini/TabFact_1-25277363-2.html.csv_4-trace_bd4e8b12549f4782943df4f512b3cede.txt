Claim interpreted: The episode number in the series for the episode titled “the test” is before 148.0.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Available table: full_house_season_7 with columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for exact title match
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.full_house_season_7
WHERE title = 'The Test';
Result: cnt = 0

2) Case-insensitive search for titles containing “test” and retrieve series and season numbers
SQL:
SELECT title, "no in series", "no in season" FROM full_house_season_7 WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%test%';
Result:
- title: "the test"; no in series: 159; no in season: 15

Assessment:
- The episode titled “the test” exists in the dataset with no in series = 159.
- 159 is not before 148.0. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “episode number in the series” corresponds to the column "no in series".
- “the test” refers to an episode title within the available Full House Season 7 dataset (the only accessible source).
- “before 148.0” is interpreted as strictly less than 148.0.
