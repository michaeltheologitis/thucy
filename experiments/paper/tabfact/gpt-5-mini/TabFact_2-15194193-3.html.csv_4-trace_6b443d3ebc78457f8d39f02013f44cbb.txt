Claim to verify: "alberto pagani have race for aermacchi 10 time , more than any other team"

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: alberto_pagani(year bigint, class text, team text, points bigint, wins bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count entries per team
SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.alberto_pagani
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result (team, cnt):
- aermacchi: 10
- norton: 4
- mv agusta: 4
- linto: 4
- honda: 2
- derbi: 1
- paton: 1
- suzuki: 1
- ducati: 1
- kreidler: 1

2) Exact case-sensitive count for 'Aermacchi'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE team = 'Aermacchi';
Result: 0

3) Case-insensitive count for 'aermacchi'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE lower(team) = 'aermacchi';
Result: 10

Analysis:
- The aggregated counts show "aermacchi" appears 10 times, which is higher than any other team (next highest is 4).
- The table stores team names in lowercase. Interpreting the claim case-insensitively, Alberto Pagani raced for Aermacchi 10 times, and this is more than for any other team in the dataset.

Assumptions:
- "times" is interpreted as the number of rows (entries) associated with each team in the alberto_pagani table.
- Team name comparison is case-insensitive due to lowercase storage in the data.
