Summary of findings
- Claim: “the wildcat play 4 game in september, 2 game in october, and 2 game in november.”
- Finding: Using the available data for the Kentucky Wildcats (1947 football season), the month-by-month game counts are: September = 2, October = 4, November = 4. This contradicts the claim.

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team (season game log for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect date strings to determine month format
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team LIMIT 10;
Results (excerpt):
- “sept 20” | “ole miss”
- “sept 27” | “cincinnati”
- “oct 4”   | “xavier”
- “oct 11”  | “9 georgia”
- “oct 18”  | “10 vanderbilt”
- “oct 25”  | “michigan state”
- “nov 1”   | “18 alabama”
- “nov 8”   | “west virginia”
- “nov 15”  | “evansville”
- “nov 22”  | “tennessee”
Observation: Months are stored as lowercase abbreviations (“sept”, “oct”, “nov”).

2) Count games by month (based on the first token of the date string)
SQL:
SELECT lower(split_part(date,' ',1)) AS month_token, count(*) AS games
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
GROUP BY month_token
ORDER BY month_token;
Results:
- sept: 2
- oct: 4
- nov: 4

3) Sanity check: total number of games in the table
SQL 1:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result: 10
SQL 2:
SELECT COUNT(game) AS non_null_game_count FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result: 10
SQL 3:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT game) AS distinct_game_count FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result: 10
Interpretation: The table lists 10 games in total, aligning with the month-by-month counts (2 + 4 + 4 = 10).

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “4 game in September” — Not supported. Data shows 2 games in September.
- “2 game in October” — Not supported. Data shows 4 games in October.
- “2 game in November” — Not supported. Data shows 4 games in November.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the available data for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football season.

Assumptions
- “the wildcat” is interpreted as the Kentucky Wildcats (football), specifically the 1947 season, because this is the only Wildcats-related dataset available in the connected TabFact database.
- Month extraction used the first token of the text-based date field (e.g., “sept”, “oct”, “nov”).
