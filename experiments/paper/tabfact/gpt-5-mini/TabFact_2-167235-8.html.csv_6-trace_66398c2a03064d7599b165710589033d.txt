Claim to verify: “Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) are all members of the Democratic Party of Albania.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact26) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection:
  - public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  - Columns (text): name, born - died, term start, term end, political party
  - This table contains Albanian prime ministers and their political party affiliations.

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Ilir Meta
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "name", "political party" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" ILIKE '%ilir meta%';
- Result:
  name: ilir meta | political party: socialist party of albania

2) Bashkim Fino
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "name", "political party" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" ILIKE '%bashkim fino%';
- Result:
  name: bashkim fino | political party: socialist party of albania

3) Ylli Bufi
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "name", "political party" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" ILIKE '%ylli bufi%';
- Result:
  name: ylli bufi | political party: socialist party of albania

4) Pandeli Majko (including first term)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "name", "political party" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" ILIKE '%pandeli majko%';
- Results:
  name: pandeli majko (1st time) | political party: socialist party of albania
  name: pandeli majko (2nd time) | political party: socialist party of albania

Analysis
- For each of the four individuals, the database lists their political affiliation as “socialist party of albania,” not the Democratic Party of Albania.
- Therefore, the claim that they are all members of the Democratic Party of Albania is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows all four figures are affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania in this dataset, not the Democratic Party of Albania.

Assumptions
- I interpret “be all member of the democratic party of albania” to mean that each named individual’s party affiliation is the Democratic Party of Albania.
- I assume the “political party” field in the prime ministers table reflects the politician’s party affiliation during their premiership and is a reliable indicator of party membership.
- I used case-insensitive name matching to capture entries with annotations like “(1st time)”.
