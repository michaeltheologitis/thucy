Claim to verify: “99000 be the number of resent point for 23 event.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16), schema: public.

Relevant schema elements:
- Table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
  - Columns: points (bigint), events (bigint), "reset points" (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Overview of all rows to understand the relationship between events and reset points
Executed SQL:
SELECT events, points, "reset points" FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY events ASC;
Result (excerpt):
- ...
- 23 | 19129 | 99000
- ...

2) Targeted check for events = 23
Executed SQL:
SELECT events, points, "reset points" FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE events = 23;
Result:
- events: 23, points: 19129, reset points: 99000

Conclusion:
- The row where events = 23 has "reset points" = 99000. This directly supports the claim when interpreted as “reset points for 23 events equals 99,000.”

Assumptions made:
- “resent point” was interpreted as “reset points,” matching the column name in the data.
- “23 event” was interpreted as the value 23 in the events column of the table public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs.
