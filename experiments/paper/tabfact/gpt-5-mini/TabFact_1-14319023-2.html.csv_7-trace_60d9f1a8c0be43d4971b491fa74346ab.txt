Claim to verify:
- In 2010, mixed doubles were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto, and the boys' singles winner was Nugroho Andi Saputro.

Data sources explored:
- TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema), table: indonesian_national_badminton_championships, with columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles.

Step 1: Check 2010 winners in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT "year", "mixed doubles", "boys singles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE "year" = 2010;

Result:
- year: 2010
- mixed doubles: jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico
- boys singles: shesar hiren rhustavito

Finding: For 2010, the dataset lists different winners than claimed.

Step 2: Search whether the claimed names appear in any year
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "mixed doubles", "boys singles"
FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%danny%'
   OR LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%debby%'
   OR LOWER("boys singles") LIKE '%nugroho%'
   OR LOWER("boys singles") LIKE '%andi%';

Result (matched rows):
- year: 2006 | mixed doubles: danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto | boys singles: nugroho andi saputro
- year: 2007 | mixed doubles: wifqi windarto debby susanto | boys singles: nandang arif

Finding: The exact pair “danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto” in mixed doubles and “nugroho andi saputro” in boys’ singles occur in 2006, not 2010.

Step 3: Retrieve full rows for 2006 and 2010 for complete context
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year IN (2006, 2010) ORDER BY year;

Results:
- 2006
  • boys singles: nugroho andi saputro
  • girls singles: sylvinna kurniawan
  • boys doubles: danny bawa chrisnanta afiat yuris wirawan
  • girls doubles: bellaetrix manuputty samantha lintang
  • mixed doubles: danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto
- 2010
  • boys singles: shesar hiren rhustavito
  • girls singles: ganis nur rahmadani
  • boys doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita
  • girls doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani
  • mixed doubles: jones ralfy jansen nurbeta kwanrico

Conclusion:
- The claim “in 2010 … mixed doubles [Danny Bawa Chrisnanta/Debby Susanto] and boys’ singles [Nugroho Andi Saputro]” is not supported by the data for 2010. Those exact winners correspond to 2006 in this authoritative dataset.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “mixed double” as the “mixed doubles” column and “boy single” as the “boys singles” column in the indonesian_national_badminton_championships table.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Indonesian National (Junior) Badminton Championships, consistent with the table’s structure and labels.
