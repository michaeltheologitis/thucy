Claim to verify: "on sunday , september 30 , the chicago bear beat the green bay packer 31 - 20"

Summary conclusion: Verified. The Bears–Packers rivalry table shows that on Sunday, September 30, 1951, the Chicago Bears defeated the Green Bay Packers 31–20.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact via postgres_tabfact10), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.bears_packers_rivalry (columns: year, date [text], winner, result, loser, attendance, location).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect sample rows to understand date/result formats
SQL:
SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 20;
Key returned row (18th in sample):
- 1951 | sunday , september 30 | chicago bears | 31 - 20 | green bay packers

2) Targeted search for September 30 with 31 - 20 Bears over Packers
SQL:
SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser
FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry
WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%september 30%';
Result:
- 1951 | sunday , september 30 | chicago bears | 31 - 20 | green bay packers

Confirmation with exact team/score match
SQL:
SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser
FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry
WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%september 30%'
  AND lower(winner) = 'chicago bears'
  AND lower(loser) = 'green bay packers'
  AND lower(result) = '31 - 20';
Result:
- 1951 | sunday , september 30 | chicago bears | 31 - 20 | green bay packers

3) Verify that September 30, 1951 is a Sunday (weekday computation)
SQL (locate 1951 dates to confirm exact stored text):
SELECT year, date FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry WHERE year = 1951;
Returned:
- { year: 1951, date: 'sunday , september 30' }
- { year: 1951, date: 'sunday , november 18' }

SQL (parse month/day and compute weekday):
SELECT year, date AS date_text,
       trim(split_part(date,',',2)) AS md_text,
       to_date(year || ' ' || trim(split_part(date,',',2)), 'YYYY FMMonth DD') AS real_date,
       to_char(to_date(year || ' ' || trim(split_part(date,',',2)), 'YYYY FMMonth DD'), 'FMDay') AS weekday_name,
       extract(dow from to_date(year || ' ' || trim(split_part(date,',',2)), 'YYYY FMMonth DD')) AS dow
FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry
WHERE year = 1951 AND split_part(date,',',2) ILIKE '%september%';
Returned:
- { year: 1951, date_text: 'sunday , september 30', md_text: 'september 30', real_date: '1951-09-30', weekday_name: 'Sunday', dow: 0 }
Interpretation: 1951-09-30 is a Sunday (PostgreSQL dow=0 indicates Sunday).

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- "on sunday" — Supported (date_text contains "sunday"; computed weekday = Sunday).
- "september 30" — Supported (date_text: "september 30"; parsed date 1951-09-30).
- "the chicago bear beat the green bay packer" — Supported (winner: chicago bears; loser: green bay packers). Singular/plural in the claim is treated as referring to team names.
- "31 - 20" — Supported (result exactly "31 - 20").

Assumptions:
- The claim did not specify a year; I interpret it as referring to the occurrence found in the dataset, which is the 1951 game on September 30.
- Minor grammatical differences (singular vs. plural team names) are interpreted as references to the team franchises.
