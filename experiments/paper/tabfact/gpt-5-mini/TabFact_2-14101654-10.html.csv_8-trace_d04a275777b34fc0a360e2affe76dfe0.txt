Claim interpreted: The user appears to claim that exactly 2 players were drafted in each of rounds 3 and 9.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered databases: TabFact (Postgres), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season with columns: round, player, position, nationality, "college / junior / club team (league)".

Evidence from queries:
1) Count of players in round 3
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 3;
Result: cnt = 1

2) Players in round 3
SQL:
SELECT player FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 3 ORDER BY player;
Results:
- rob bellamy

3) Count of players in round 9
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 9;
Result: cnt = 2

4) Players in round 9
SQL:
SELECT player FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 9 ORDER BY player;
Results:
- john carter
- triston grant

Assessment:
- Round 3 has 1 drafted player, not 2.
- Round 9 has 2 drafted players.
Therefore, the statement that there were 2 players drafted in each of rounds 3 and 9 is contradicted by the data in this table.

Assumptions:
- The table public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season represents draft picks associated with that season and team, and the round column denotes the draft round for each player.
- The claim pertains to this dataset; if a different team/league/season was intended, results could differ, but only this authoritative data source was available.
