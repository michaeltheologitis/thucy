Claim interpreted: “softball be the sport with the second latest date.” I verify this against the available data by identifying the latest and second-latest distinct event dates and the sports occurring on those dates.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date text, site text, sport text, "winning team" text, series text)

Step 1 — Inspect the data and date format
Executed SQL:
SELECT "date", sport, site, "winning team", series
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
LIMIT 30;
Result summary (13 rows returned; sample shown):
- april 1 , 2008 | softball | ames | iowa | iowa state 18 - 9
- march 7 , 2008 | w gymnastics | iowa city | iowa | iowa state 18 - 7
- february 22 , 2008 | w gymnastics | ames | iowa state | iowa state 18 - 5
- december 9 , 2007 | wrestling | ames | iowa | iowa state 16 - 5
(...)
Note: Dates are stored as text like "april 1 , 2008" (lowercase month, space before comma).

Step 2 — Order events by parsed date (latest first)
Executed SQL:
SELECT sport, date AS raw_date,
       to_date(initcap(regexp_replace(date, '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'Month FMDD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE to_date(initcap(regexp_replace(date, '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'Month FMDD, YYYY') IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY parsed_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
Top results:
1) softball — 2008-04-01 (raw: april 1 , 2008)
2) w gymnastics — 2008-03-07 (raw: march 7 , 2008)
3) w gymnastics — 2008-02-22 (raw: february 22 , 2008)
4) wrestling — 2007-12-09
5) m basketball — 2007-12-08

Step 3 — Compute the second-latest distinct date and the sport(s) on that date
Executed SQL to find second-latest distinct date:
SELECT parsed_date FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT to_date(initcap(replace(trim(date),' , ',', ')),'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  WHERE date IS NOT NULL
) t
ORDER BY parsed_date DESC
OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
Result:
- 2008-03-07

Executed SQL to list sports on that date:
SELECT sport, to_date(initcap(replace(trim(date),' , ',', ')),'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE to_date(initcap(replace(trim(date),' , ',', ')),'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY') = DATE '2008-03-07'
ORDER BY sport;
Result:
- w gymnastics | 2008-03-07

Step 4 — Confirm latest date and sport(s)
Executed SQL (latest date):
SELECT MAX(to_date(date,'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY')) AS latest_date
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series;
Result:
- 2008-04-01

Executed SQL (sports on latest date):
SELECT DISTINCT sport
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE to_date(date,'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY') = (
  SELECT MAX(to_date(date,'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY'))
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
);
Result:
- softball

Conclusion
- The latest date in the dataset is 2008-04-01, and the sport on that date is softball.
- The second-latest distinct date is 2008-03-07, and the sport on that date is w gymnastics.
- Therefore, the claim that “softball [is] the sport with the second latest date” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpret “second latest date” as the second most recent distinct date in the table.
- Dates are parsed from the text format "month day , year" using to_date after normalizing whitespace and casing as shown above.
- Verification is constrained to the single available table: public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series.
