Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that there was a season in which rebounds per game were 15.0 and, in that same season, points per game were 23.8.

Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard.

Evidence gathering steps and results:
1) Scan seasons with points and rebounds per game
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "points per game", "rebounds per game" 
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
ORDER BY season ASC;
- Returned rows (subset relevant to the claim):
  - 2007 - 08 (1 / 2) | points per game: 23.8 | rebounds per game: 15.0
  - 2007 - 08 (2 / 2) | points per game: 21.7 | rebounds per game: 16.1
  (Other rows omitted here are not directly relevant to 15.0 rebounds per game.)

2) Directly filter for rows with 15.0 rebounds per game
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "points per game" FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard
WHERE regexp_replace("rebounds per game", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') <> ''
  AND regexp_replace("rebounds per game", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g')::numeric = 15.0;
- Result:
  - season: 2007 - 08 (1 / 2) | points per game: 23.8

Conclusion: The data shows a season entry where rebounds per game equals 15.0 and, in that same entry, points per game equals 23.8. This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the user statement as referring to entries in the Dwight Howard career achievements table: “In the season with 15.0 rebounds per game, points per game were 23.8.”
- The columns are stored as text; numeric comparisons were performed after stripping non-numeric characters, as shown in the SQL.
- The presence of two entries for 2007–08 (labeled 1/2 and 2/2) indicates separate records for that season; the claim is satisfied by the specific 2007–08 (1/2) entry where rebounds per game = 15.0 and points per game = 23.8.
