Claim assessed: "the latitude for the township janke be - 97.945530"

Summary conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. In the authoritative data for North Dakota townships, Janke Township (Logan County) has latitude 46.415512. The value -97.945530 is not a valid latitude (outside [-90, 90]) and resembles a longitude instead. The recorded longitude for Janke Township is approximately -99.131701.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Retrieve Janke Township coordinates
SQL:
SELECT township, county, latitude, longitude
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE township ILIKE '%janke%';

Result:
- township: janke
- county: logan
- latitude: 46.415512
- longitude (raw text): "- 99.131701"

2) Verify uniqueness of the Janke match
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE township ILIKE '%janke%';
Result: 1

Interpretation:
- The only Janke Township in the dataset (North Dakota) has latitude 46.415512, not -97.945530.
- The value -97.945530 is not a plausible latitude and more closely resembles a longitude. The actual longitude on record for Janke Township is about -99.131701.

Assumptions:
- "township janke" refers to Janke Township in North Dakota, as represented in the available authoritative dataset.
- The dataset’s latitude/longitude fields are the source of truth; longitude is stored as text with a leading space but corresponds numerically to -99.131701 after trimming.
