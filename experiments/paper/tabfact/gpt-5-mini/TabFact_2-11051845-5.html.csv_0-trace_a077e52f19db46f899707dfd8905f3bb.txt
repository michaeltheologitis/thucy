Summary of approach
- Explored the available data sources and identified a relevant table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (TabFact Postgres). This table includes: ngc number, object type, constellation, right ascension (J2000), declination (J2000), and apparent magnitude.
- Interpreted the claim as a comparison of apparent magnitude values between entries labeled “irregular galaxy” and “spiral galaxy.” I checked whether there exists a pair where the irregular galaxy’s apparent magnitude is 2.1 greater than a spiral galaxy’s, and also examined overall context (counts/averages) to guard against alternate interpretations (e.g., averages by type).

Key findings from the data
1) The table contains the object types of interest
- Evidence SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "object type" FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 ORDER BY "object type";
- Result: globular cluster; irregular galaxy; spiral galaxy

2) Individual rows and magnitudes for the two object types
- Evidence SQL:
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE "object type" IN ('irregular galaxy', 'spiral galaxy')
  ORDER BY "object type", "ngc number";
- Result rows:
  • NGC 5408 — irregular galaxy — apparent magnitude: 14.0
  • NGC 5477 — irregular galaxy — apparent magnitude: 14.5
  • NGC 5457 — spiral galaxy — apparent magnitude: 8.7
  • NGC 5474 — spiral galaxy — apparent magnitude: 11.9

3) Direct test for a 2.1 difference (irregular minus spiral)
- Evidence SQL:
  SELECT ig."ngc number" AS irregular_ngc,
         ig."apparent magnitude" AS irregular_mag,
         sp."ngc number" AS spiral_ngc,
         sp."apparent magnitude" AS spiral_mag,
         (ig."apparent magnitude" - sp."apparent magnitude") AS diff
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 ig
  JOIN public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 sp
    ON TRUE
  WHERE ig."object type" = 'irregular galaxy'
    AND sp."object type" = 'spiral galaxy'
    AND ABS((ig."apparent magnitude" - sp."apparent magnitude") - 2.1) < 1e-9
  ORDER BY irregular_ngc, spiral_ngc;
- Result: One matching pair
  • Irregular: NGC 5408, apparent magnitude 14.0
  • Spiral:    NGC 5474, apparent magnitude 11.9
  • Difference: 2.0999999999999996 (i.e., 2.1 within floating-point tolerance)

4) Additional context (averages by type)
- Evidence SQL:
  SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count_rows, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_app_mag
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  GROUP BY "object type"
  ORDER BY count_rows DESC, "object type";
- Results:
  • irregular galaxy: 2 rows, average apparent magnitude = 14.25
  • spiral galaxy: 2 rows, average apparent magnitude = 10.30
  • globular cluster: 1 row, average apparent magnitude = 10.50
- Observation: If interpreted as a statement about averages, the difference (14.25 − 10.30 ≈ 3.95) is not 2.1. However, the existence of a specific pair with a 2.1 difference is confirmed (NGC 5408 vs NGC 5474).

Conclusion
- The data confirm that there exists at least one irregular galaxy in this table whose apparent magnitude is exactly 2.1 greater than that of a spiral galaxy (NGC 5408 [14.0] vs NGC 5474 [11.9]).
- If the claim is intended as a general statement about the object types overall (e.g., their typical or average magnitudes), it is not supported by the averages in this table (difference ~3.95, not 2.1).

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted the statement to mean there exists at least one irregular–spiral pair in the given table where the irregular galaxy’s apparent magnitude exceeds the spiral galaxy’s by 2.1. If the intent was to compare type-level averages, that interpretation is not supported by the data above.
