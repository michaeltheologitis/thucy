Step 1 — Discover data sources
- Source discovered: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema.

Step 2 — Inspect relevant schema
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 't_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland';

Result (abridged):
- opposing team (text)
- against (bigint)
- date (text)
- venue (text)
- status (text)

Interpretation: This table lists matches from the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour. The column “against” holds a numeric score; sampling the table (see below) shows it represents points scored by the opposing team (i.e., points conceded by New Zealand). For example, the row for Munster shows “against = 12,” matching the historical 12–0 result (Munster 12, NZ 0), confirming “against” are opponents’ points.

Step 3 — Locate the Cambridge University row and its ‘against’ value
Executed SQL:
SELECT "opposing team", "against", "date", "status"
FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE lower("opposing team") LIKE '%cambridge%';

Result:
- opposing team: cambridge university | against: 12 | date: 18 october 1978 | status: tour match

Check if any ‘against’ value for Cambridge University exceeds 10
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_over_10, MAX("against") AS max_against
FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE lower("opposing team") LIKE '%cambridge%';

Result:
- count_over_10 = 1
- max_against = 12

Findings relative to the claim
- The only row matching Cambridge University in this dataset has “against = 12.”
- If we interpret the claim as asserting that no relevant score exceeds 10 for Cambridge University, the data shows a value of 12, which is greater than 10.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim under a reasonable mapping of the statement to the available table: a value strictly greater than 10 (12) exists for Cambridge University.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the context of the available table, where Cambridge University appears as an opposing team in the 1978 New Zealand rugby tour data. The column “against” is used as the relevant scoring metric tied to the Cambridge University row. While “against” here reflects points scored by Cambridge University against New Zealand (not points scored against Cambridge), the claim is taken to concern whether any related ‘against’ value exceeds 10 for Cambridge University in the provided data. Under this mapping, the claim is contradicted by the observed value (12).
