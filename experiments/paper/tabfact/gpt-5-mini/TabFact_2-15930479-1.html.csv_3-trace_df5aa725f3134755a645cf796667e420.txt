Summary
- Claim: “jérôme pineau be the winner for october 9's event.”
- Scope used for verification: The only accessible dataset is the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup table. I interpreted “October 9’s event” as the event held on October 9 within this dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database (connector: postgres_tabfact13), schema: public
- Table: t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup
  - Columns: date (text), event (text), winner (text), team (text), "series leader" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify how October dates appear and confirm existence of an October 9 entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE date ILIKE '%Oct%' OR date ILIKE '%October%';
Result excerpt included the entry: "october 9"

2) Retrieve the event and winner for October 9
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, event, winner, team FROM t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE date ILIKE 'october 9';
Result:
- date: october 9
- event: paris - bourges
- winner: bernhard eisel ( aut )
- team: team columbia

3) Check whether Jérôme Pineau appears as a winner anywhere in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, event, winner, team, "series leader" FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE winner ILIKE '%Pineau%';
Result: No rows returned (no winners containing “Pineau”).

Conclusion
- The data shows that the October 9 event (Paris–Bourges) was won by Bernhard Eisel (Team Columbia), not Jérôme Pineau. There is no record of Jérôme Pineau as a winner in this table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the event on October 9 within the available dataset (2008 French Road Cycling Cup). If a different year or domain was intended, it is not represented in the accessible data. All conclusions are based strictly on the available dataset.
