Claim: “錢 , 兩 , and 斤 all have metric value that be measure in g.”

Data discovery
- Source discovery: Found one accessible PostgreSQL data source (TabFact) with a public schema containing a single table: chinese_units_of_measurement.
- Schema inspection: Table public.chinese_units_of_measurement columns: jyutping (text), character (text), portuguese (text), "relative value" (text), "metric value" (text), "imperial value" (text).

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character IN ('錢','兩','斤');

- Results:
  • 錢 — relative value: 1 / 160; metric value: 3.779936375 g; imperial value: ~2.1333dr
  • 兩 — relative value: 1 / 16; metric value: 37.79936375 g; imperial value: ~1.3333oz
  • 斤 — relative value: 1; metric value: 604.78982 g; imperial value: ~1.3333lb

Assessment
- For each of the three units (錢, 兩, 斤), the table explicitly provides a “metric value” expressed in grams (g). Therefore, the claim that all three have a metric value measurable in grams is supported by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the evidence from the TabFact database table chinese_units_of_measurement.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement to mean: “Each of the units 錢 (qian), 兩 (liang), and 斤 (jin) has a defined metric equivalent expressed in grams.”
- The values observed correspond to a specific standard reflected in this dataset (e.g., catty ≈ 604.78982 g), which may represent the Hong Kong legal standard. Other regions historically used different conversions, but this does not affect the truth of the claim that metric equivalents in grams exist.
