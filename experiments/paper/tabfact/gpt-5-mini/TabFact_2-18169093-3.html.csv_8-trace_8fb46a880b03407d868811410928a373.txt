Claim to verify: “In the 1981 Open Championship the winning score was 72, with two players tied for this score: Isao Aoki and David Graham.”

Summary conclusion based on data: The data shows the best (winning) score in the table is 70 (two players tied: Vicente Fernández and Nick Job). Isao Aoki and David Graham each shot 71 and were tied for third. A score of 72 was recorded by eight different players, none of whom were Aoki or Graham.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact17 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.t_1981_open_championship with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text)

Evidence and exact SQL used:
1) Place formatting in the table (to understand ranking encoding)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place;
- Result: t1, t3, t9 (indicates ties via leading “t”)

2) Determine the winning/best score in this table and who achieved it
- SQL (min score): SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: [{"min_score":70}]
- SQL (rows with that min score): SELECT place, player, score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = (SELECT MIN(score) FROM public.t_1981_open_championship) ORDER BY place;
- Result: [{"place":"t1","player":"vicente fernã¡ndez","score":70}, {"place":"t1","player":"nick job","score":70}]
- Interpretation: The best (winning) score reflected in this table is 70, shared by two players (tied for first).

3) Verify the scores for Isao Aoki and David Graham
- SQL: SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%aoki%' OR player ILIKE '%graham%';
- Result: Isao Aoki — place: t3, score: 71, to par: + 1; David Graham — place: t3, score: 71, to par: + 1
- Interpretation: Both Aoki and Graham shot 71 (+1), not 72.

4) Identify who scored 72 and how many such players there were
- SQL (list): SELECT place, player, "to par", score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72 ORDER BY place NULLS LAST, player;
- Result (players with 72): arnold palmer; ben crenshaw; bill rogers; david jagger; greg norman; howard clark; mark james; sam torrance — each at place t9 and to par +2
- SQL (count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72;
- Result: [{"count":8}]
- Interpretation: Eight players recorded 72; neither Aoki nor Graham are among them.

Optional supporting context (full leaderboard preview)
- SQL: SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place, score;
- Key rows at the top: t1 — vicente fernã¡ndez (70, E), nick job (70, E); t3 — isao aoki (71, +1), david graham (71, +1), etc.; t9 — multiple players at 72 (+2) including bill rogers, arnold palmer, greg norman.

Assessment against the claim:
- “Winning score was 72” — contradicted by data; best score is 70, not 72.
- “Two players tied at 72: Isao Aoki and David Graham” — contradicted by data; Aoki and Graham shot 71 (+1), tied for third. There were 8 players at 72 and neither Aoki nor Graham is among them.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “winning score” as the best (lowest) score represented in the provided table (place values such as t1 indicate first place tie). The table does not have a dedicated “winner” column and appears to reflect a leaderboard snapshot for the 1981 Open Championship as stored in this dataset.
