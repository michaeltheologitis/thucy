Claim to verify: “After 2000, only Brazil and England contribute 1 player to the Utah Jazz.”

Data source checked
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Method
- Interpreted “after 2000” as players whose “years for jazz” includes any four-digit year >= 2001.
- Counted distinct players by nationality under that filter.

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Identify players with any four-digit year >= 2001 in their “years for jazz”
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player, nationality
FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster t
CROSS JOIN LATERAL regexp_matches("years for jazz", '(\\d{4})','g') AS m
WHERE (m)[1]::int >= 2001
ORDER BY nationality, player;
Result rows:
- nationality: brazil, player: rafael araãjo
- nationality: england, player: john amaechi
- nationality: puerto rico, player: carlos arroyo
- nationality: united states, player: louis amundson

2) Aggregate counts by nationality
SQL:
SELECT nationality, count(*) AS player_count, array_agg(player ORDER BY player) AS players
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT player, nationality
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster t
  CROSS JOIN LATERAL regexp_matches("years for jazz", '(\\d{4})','g') AS m
  WHERE (m)[1]::int >= 2001
) AS sub
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY player_count DESC, nationality;
Result:
- brazil — player_count: 1 — players: [rafael araãjo]
- england — player_count: 1 — players: [john amaechi]
- puerto rico — player_count: 1 — players: [carlos arroyo]
- united states — player_count: 1 — players: [louis amundson]

Conclusion
- The data shows four nationalities each contributing exactly one player after 2000: Brazil, England, Puerto Rico, and the United States. Therefore, it is not true that “only Brazil and England” contributed one player.

Assumptions
- “After 2000” interpreted as any year >= 2001 appearing in the “years for jazz” field.
- Counted distinct players per nationality who meet the above condition.
- Relied on four-digit year extraction from the text field; this correctly captures all post-2000 entries present in this dataset.
