What I checked
- Whether Daniel Palladino directed exactly 3 fewer episodes than Amy Sherman-Palladino, using the available authoritative data source discovered (a table of Gilmore Girls episodes with director metadata).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
- Relevant columns: title (text), director (text), writer (s) (text), etc.

Key evidence
1) Identify directors containing “Palladino” and their episode counts
SQL executed:
SELECT director, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE lower(director) LIKE '%palladino%'
GROUP BY director
ORDER BY episode_count DESC, director;
Result:
- amy sherman - palladino — 1
- daniel palladino — 1

2) Per-person counts using robust matching (case-insensitive, allowing spaces around the hyphen for Amy Sherman‑Palladino)
- Daniel Palladino
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE director ~* 'daniel palladino';
Result: 1

- Amy Sherman‑Palladino (allowing optional spaces around the hyphen)
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE director ~* 'amy sherman\s*-\s*palladino';
Result: 1

Conclusion
- Daniel Palladino directed 1 episode; Amy Sherman‑Palladino directed 1 episode in this dataset. The difference is 0, not “3 fewer.”

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the only available authoritative dataset: the Gilmore Girls episode table (public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes). If the intent was to compare across other series or all works, that data is not present here, and this verification pertains strictly to Gilmore Girls episodes in this dataset.
