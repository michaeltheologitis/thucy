Claim to verify:
"Equestrian at the Asian Games has been located in a different city every year that it occurred."

Data discovery and scope:
- I used the available database discovery tools and found a PostgreSQL database exposing a table named public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games. All evidence below is drawn from this table.

Evidence 1: Confirm the table exists
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE'
  ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
- Relevant result excerpt shows presence of: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games

Evidence 2: Understand the table structure
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, ordinal_position
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='equestrian_at_the_asian_games'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (columns):
  1) year (bigint)
  2) location (text)
  3) gold (text)
  4) silver (text)
  5) bronze (text)

Evidence 3: Check if any location (city) repeats across different years
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS cnt,
         CASE WHEN COUNT(*)>1 THEN array_agg(year ORDER BY year) ELSE NULL END AS years
  FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games
  GROUP BY location
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, location;
- Results (location — count — years):
  bangkok — 1 — NULL
  busan — 1 — NULL
  doha — 1 — NULL
  guangzhou — 1 — NULL
  hiroshima — 1 — NULL
  new delhi — 1 — NULL
  seoul — 1 — NULL
- Interpretation: Every location appears exactly once; no city repeats among the recorded editions.

Evidence 4: Full year-to-location mapping in the table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
- Results:
  1982 | new delhi
  1986 | seoul
  1994 | hiroshima
  1998 | bangkok
  2002 | busan
  2006 | doha
  2010 | guangzhou
- Interpretation: For the years recorded (1982–2010), equestrian was held in a different city each time it occurred.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available dataset (covering the years 1982–2010), equestrian at the Asian Games has indeed been located in a different city every time it took place. There are no repeated cities in the table.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- I interpret “location” as the host city for equestrian at each Asian Games edition.
- The table appears to list all years in which equestrian was contested between 1982 and 2010. The database provided does not include data beyond 2010; therefore, my verification applies to the covered period only.
- I interpret “every year that it occur” to mean every edition/year in which equestrian was on the program, which in this dataset are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.
