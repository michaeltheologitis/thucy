Claim being checked: “l 72 - 86 result have a seed less than 12 and a year that’s larger than 1996.”

Interpretation: In the table public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball, the row whose results field equals the string “l 72 - 86” is claimed to have seed < 12 and year > 1996.

What the data shows:
- The only row with results = “l 72 - 86” has year = 1980 and seed = 12. Therefore:
  - seed < 12 is false (12 is not less than 12).
  - year > 1996 is false (1980 is not greater than 1996).

Supporting evidence and exact SQL:
1) Locate the row with results = 'l 72 - 86' and evaluate the conditions directly
SQL:
SELECT year, seed, (seed < 12) AS seed_lt_12, (year > 1996) AS year_gt_1996
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
WHERE results = 'l 72 - 86';
Result:
- year: 1980; seed: 12; seed_lt_12: false; year_gt_1996: false

2) Show the row in full context
SQL:
SELECT year, seed, region, results, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE results = 'l 72 - 86';
Result:
- year: 1980; seed: 12; region: east; results: l 72 - 86; record: 18 - 12

3) (Context) Full table snapshot ordered by year confirms the only “l 72 - 86” entry is in 1980 with seed 12
SQL:
SELECT year, seed, region, results, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball ORDER BY year ASC;
Excerpt of relevant row:
- 1980, 12, east, l 72 - 86, 18 - 12

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. The “l 72 - 86” result does not have a seed less than 12 nor a year larger than 1996.

Assumptions noted:
- I interpreted “l 72 - 86 result” as the row where the results column exactly equals the string “l 72 - 86”.
- I did not interpret “72 - 86” as line numbers, since the table has only 12 rows, making a line-range interpretation infeasible (confirmed via COUNT).
