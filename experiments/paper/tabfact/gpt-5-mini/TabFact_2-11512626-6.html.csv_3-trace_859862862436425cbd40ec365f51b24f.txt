Claim being checked: “when the score be 10 - 4, the Colorado Rockies' record go to 68 - 70 in a game against the Athletics.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Method
- Identify all 1997 Colorado Rockies games against the Athletics and check for any game with a score of 10-4, then read the postgame record from the record column.

Evidence
1) Targeted search for an Athletics game with a normalized score of 10-4
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record,
       regexp_replace(regexp_replace(score, E'–|—', '-', 'g'), E'\s+', '', 'g') as normalized_score
FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Athletics%'
  AND regexp_replace(regexp_replace(score, E'–|—', '-', 'g'), E'\s+', '', 'g') = '10-4';
- Result row:
  {"date":"august 31","opponent":"athletics","score":"10 - 4","record":"68 - 70","normalized_score":"10-4"}

2) Context: list all games vs. the Athletics
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Athletics%' ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  - august 30 — 4 - 3 — 67 - 70
  - august 31 — 10 - 4 — 68 - 70

Conclusion
- The data shows that on August 31 (1997), the Rockies played the Athletics, the final score was 10 - 4, and the Rockies’ postgame record became 68 - 70. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Opponent matching used case-insensitive substring (ILIKE '%Athletics%').
- Score normalization treated hyphen/en-dash/em-dash equivalently and ignored spaces to match “10 - 4” to “10-4”.
