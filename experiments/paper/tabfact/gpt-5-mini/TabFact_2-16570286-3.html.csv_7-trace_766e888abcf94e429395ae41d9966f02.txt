Claim to verify: “all of the england player take as many wicket as bill johnston.”

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public
- Available table: public.t_1948_ashes_series with columns [player, team, matches, wickets, average, "best bowling"]

Step 1 — Confirm team labels present in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series ORDER BY team;
Result:
- australia
- england

Step 2 — Find Bill Johnston’s wickets (reference value)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, team, matches, wickets, average, "best bowling" FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player ILIKE '%Bill Johnston%';
Result:
- player: bill johnston; team: australia; matches: 5; wickets: 27; average: 23.33; best bowling: 5 / 36

Step 3 — Check England players vs. Bill Johnston’s wickets (27)
3a) Count England players in table
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_england FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england';
Result: total_england = 3

3b) How many England players have wickets ≥ 27?
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS england_wickets_ge_27 FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england' AND wickets >= 27;
Result: england_wickets_ge_27 = 0

3c) How many England players have wickets = 27?
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS england_wickets_eq_27 FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england' AND wickets = 27;
Result: england_wickets_eq_27 = 0

3d) Which England players have wickets < 27?
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england' AND wickets < 27 ORDER BY wickets ASC, player ASC;
Result rows:
- jim laker — 9
- norman yardley — 9
- alec bedser — 18

Optional cross-check — Total England wickets (if interpreting the claim as a team-total comparison)
Executed SQL (player breakdown):
SELECT player, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE lower(team) = 'england' ORDER BY player;
Result rows:
- alec bedser — 18
- jim laker — 9
- norman yardley — 9
Executed SQL (sum):
SELECT SUM(wickets) AS total_wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE lower(team) = 'england';
Result:
- total_wickets = 36

Findings
- Bill Johnston took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes (per the dataset).
- No England player in the dataset took as many as 27 wickets; the listed England players had 9, 9, and 18 wickets respectively.
- Therefore, the statement that “all of the England player[s] take as many wicket[s] as Bill Johnston” is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate with respect to the data in public.t_1948_ashes_series.

Assumptions
- “England player” refers to rows where team = 'england' in public.t_1948_ashes_series (1948 Ashes series context).
- “as many wicket[s] as Bill Johnston” was interpreted in the strict per-player sense (equal to or at least as many). Under either interpretation, the claim is false, as no England player reached 27 wickets in this dataset.
