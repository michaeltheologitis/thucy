Claim interpreted: “game alert ask for 200000.” I interpret this as asserting that a pitch named (or sounding like) “Game Alert” asked for 200,000 on Dragons’ Den UK.

Data source discovery
- I discovered an accessible TabFact database with a public schema containing a table relevant to Dragons’ Den UK pitches: public.dragons_den_uk.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.dragons_den_uk
  - Columns:
    - episode (text)
    - first aired (text)
    - entrepreneur (s) (text)
    - company or product name (text)
    - money requested (bigint)
    - investing dragon (s) (text)

Evidence collected
1) Searched for an exact company/product name match to “Game Alert” (case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "first aired", "company or product name", "money requested" 
FROM public.dragons_den_uk
WHERE lower(trim("company or product name")) = 'game alert';
Result: No matching rows.

2) Searched for any name containing the phrase “game alert” (case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "first aired", "company or product name", "money requested"
FROM public.dragons_den_uk
WHERE lower("company or product name") LIKE '%game alert%';
Result: No matching rows.

3) Broadened search to find all rows with money requested = 200000:
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "investing dragon (s)" FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE "money requested" = 200000;
Result:
- episode: episode 2; company or product name: gaming alerts; entrepreneur(s): emmie matthews & ed stevens; investing dragons: theo paphitis.

4) Retrieved full details for that candidate match (“gaming alerts”):
SQL executed:
SELECT "episode", "first aired", "company or product name", "money requested", "entrepreneur (s)", "investing dragon (s)"
FROM public.dragons_den_uk
WHERE "company or product name" ILIKE '%gaming alerts%';
Result:
- episode: episode 2
- first aired: 22 october 2007
- company or product name: gaming alerts
- money requested: 200000
- entrepreneur(s): emmie matthews & ed stevens
- investing dragon(s): theo paphitis

Assessment
- While there is no exact match for the name “Game Alert,” the dataset contains a pitch named “gaming alerts” that asked for 200,000. Given the close similarity in naming and the precise match on the amount requested, the core substance of the claim (“…ask for 200000”) is supported by the data.

Answer: The claim is supported by the available data, with a minor naming variation (gaming alerts vs. game alert).

Assumptions made
- I interpreted “game alert” as referring to the company/product “gaming alerts” recorded in the Dragons’ Den UK dataset, considering the close lexical similarity and exact match on the requested amount.
- Currency is not specified in the table; I assume the amount is in the show’s standard currency (GBP) though this is not required for verifying the numeric claim.
