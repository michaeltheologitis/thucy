Summary
- Data source discovered: postgres_tabfact14 (TabFact), schema public. Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season. This table contains 12 consecutive games (game numbers 62–73), corresponding to a March 2011 stretch of the Detroit Pistons’ 2010–2011 season.
- Claim to verify (interpreted): During this period (the 12-game stretch represented in this table), the Detroit Pistons won by more than 10 points in 3 games.

What the data shows
1) Period coverage (to characterize the dataset scope)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
Result:
- total_rows: 12, min_game: 62, max_game: 73

2) List of wins by more than 10 points (parse score, compute margin, filter to wins with margin > 10)
SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent, score,
 (regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\1'))::int AS det_points,
 (regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\2'))::int AS opp_points,
 ((regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\2'))::int) AS margin
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE substring(score FROM '^[wl]') = 'w'
AND ((regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\2'))::int) > 10
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- Washington — march 6 — w 113 - 102 (ot) — margin 11
- Toronto — march 16 — w 107 - 93 (ot) — margin 14
- Indiana — march 26 — w 100 - 88 (ot) — margin 12

3) Count of such games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_by_more_than_10
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE substring(score FROM '^[wl]') = 'w'
AND ((regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(score, '^[wl]\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+).*$', '\\2'))::int) > 10;
Result:
- wins_by_more_than_10: 3

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 3 wins by more than 10 points within this period (games 62–73). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the available table.

Assumptions
- “This period of their 2010–2011 season” is interpreted as the 12-game stretch captured in public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (games 62–73, March 2011).
- “Over 10 point” means strictly greater than 10 (i.e., margin ≥ 11).
