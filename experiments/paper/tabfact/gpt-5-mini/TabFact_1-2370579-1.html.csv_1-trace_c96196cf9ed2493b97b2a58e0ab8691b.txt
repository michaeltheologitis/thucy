Claim: “jeremy summer direct the episode written by tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens)”

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact13 (public schema)
- Table: public.the_baron (columns: episode, prod, title, directed by, written by, originalairdate, filmed)

Step 1 — Find episodes written by Tony O’Grady and see who directed them.
Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by" 
FROM public.the_baron
WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Tony O''Grady%'
   OR "written by" ILIKE '%O''Grady%'
   OR "written by" ILIKE '%Tony OGrady%'
   OR "written by" ILIKE '%OGrady%';

Results:
- 12 — the maze — tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens) — jeremy summers
- 26 — the long , long day — tony o'grady — roy baker

Step 2 — Identify all episodes directed by Jeremy Summers (to cross-check the match).
Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT episode, title, "directed by", "written by"
FROM public.the_baron
WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%jeremy%';

Results:
- 5 — enemy of the state — jeremy summers — dennis spooner
- 12 — the maze — jeremy summers — tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens)
- 17 — time to kill — jeremy summers — dennis spooner

Analysis:
- Episode 12 (“the maze”) is explicitly credited as written by “tony o'grady (pseudonym of brian clemens)” and directed by “jeremy summers,” directly satisfying the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “jeremy summer” refers to “Jeremy Summers” (director), allowing for a missing final “s”.
- The claim pertains to the TV series represented in the available dataset (The Baron), as that is the only accessible data source.
- Case-insensitive matching was used to account for capitalization and apostrophes in names.
