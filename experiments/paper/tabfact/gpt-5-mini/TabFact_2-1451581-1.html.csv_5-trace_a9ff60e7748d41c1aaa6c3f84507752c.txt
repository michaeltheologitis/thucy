Claim to verify: “Cologne Bonn Airport saw a 0.1% increase in cargo.”

Summary of finding
- The available dataset shows Cologne Bonn Airport (CGN/EDDK) recorded a 0.5% change in cargo, not 0.1%. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Column inspection to ensure correct identifiers
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

Returned columns:
- rank (bigint)
- airport (text)
- code (iata / icao) (text)
- total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint)
- % change (text)

2) Targeted retrieval for Cologne/Bonn and CGN/EDDK
SQL executed:
SELECT "airport", "code (iata / icao)" AS code, "rank", "total cargo (metric tonnes)" AS total_cargo, "% change" AS percent_change
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Cologne%' OR airport ILIKE '%Bonn%' OR "code (iata / icao)" ILIKE '%CGN%' OR "code (iata / icao)" ILIKE '%EDDK%'
ORDER BY "rank";

Result returned:
- airport: cologne bonn airport
- code: cgn / eddk
- rank: 28
- total_cargo: 730054
- percent_change: 0.5%

(Additional retrieval performed earlier reached the same row via a name match; included here for completeness.)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, airport, "code (iata / icao)" AS code, "total cargo (metric tonnes)" AS total_cargo, "% change" AS percent_change
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Cologne%' OR "code (iata / icao)" = 'CGN';

Returned row:
- rank: 28
- airport: cologne bonn airport
- code: cgn / eddk
- total_cargo: 730054
- percent_change: 0.5%

Assessment
- The dataset indicates a 0.5% change in cargo for Cologne Bonn Airport. The claim of a 0.1% increase is not supported by this data.

Assumptions and scope
- Timeframe is not specified in the claim. The verification is based on the available “world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic” table snapshot in the TabFact public schema, treated as authoritative per instructions.
- Matching performed case-insensitively on airport name containing “Cologne” or “Bonn” and code containing “CGN” or “EDDK.”
