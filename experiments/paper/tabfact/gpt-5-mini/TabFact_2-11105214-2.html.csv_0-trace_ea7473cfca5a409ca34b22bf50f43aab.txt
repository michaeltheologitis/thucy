Claim interpreted: “Dundee West has a lower swing-to-gain (percentage points) than Western Isles.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered one available database/table: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 (Scottish Parliament, 2007).
- Schema inspection shows a column named “swing to gain,” suitable for this comparison.

Key evidence from data:
1) Retrieve swing-to-gain values for the two constituencies
- SQL executed:
  SELECT constituency, "swing to gain" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE lower(constituency) IN ('dundee west', 'western isles');
- Results:
  - Dundee West — 2.13
  - Western Isles — 2.91

2) Confirm there is exactly one row for each constituency
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_dundee_west FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE lower(constituency) = lower('Dundee West');
- Result: 1

- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_western_isles FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE lower(constituency) = lower('Western Isles');
- Result: 1

Conclusion:
- Dundee West’s swing to gain (2.13) is lower than Western Isles’ (2.91) in the 2007 Scottish Parliament dataset. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Western isle” refers to the constituency listed as “Western Isles.”
- “Swing to gain point” refers to the value in the “swing to gain” column of the 2007 Scottish Parliament dataset.
