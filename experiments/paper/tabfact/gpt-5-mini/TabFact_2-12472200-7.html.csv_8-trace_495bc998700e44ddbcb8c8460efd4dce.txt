Claim to verify: “From 2007–2011, Olga Govortsova’s WTA year-end ranking have always gone up.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (Postgres), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.olga_govortsova with columns: tournament (TEXT), 2007 (TEXT), 2008 (TEXT), 2009 (TEXT), 2010 (TEXT), 2011 (TEXT).

Evidence gathered
1) Inspect the entire table to locate any row containing year-end ranking values.
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;
Key row observed:
- tournament: year end ranking | 2007: 49 | 2008: 49 | 2009: 52 | 2010: 74 | 2011: 114

2) Retrieve the specific row for year-end ranking to confirm values.
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'year end ranking';
Result:
- tournament: year end ranking
  2007: 49
  2008: 49
  2009: 52
  2010: 74
  2011: 114

Assessment
- If “go up” means improve (better ranking), then rankings should decrease numerically year over year. The data show 49, 49, 52, 74, 114 — this is not an improvement; it stays flat from 2007 to 2008, then worsens every year through 2011.
- If “go up” means the numeric rank becomes a larger number, the sequence is not “always” going up because 2008 equals 2007 (49 → 49). Therefore, the claim is still false.

Conclusion
- The claim that her WTA year-end ranking “always go up” from 2007–2011 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “go up” as either (a) improvement in ranking (lower number is better) or (b) strictly increasing numeric rank. Under both interpretations, the claim does not hold given the observed values.
