Claim interpreted: In the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset, the entrant was “private” on two occasions, corresponding to drivers Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin, with tyres coded “p” and “d” respectively.

Evidence from the data

1) Count of rows where entrant = 'private'
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_private FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant = 'private';
- Result:
  count_private = 2

2) List the drivers and tyres for rows where entrant = 'private'
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, tyre FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant = 'private';
- Results:
  - driver = "toni branca", tyre = "p"
  - driver = "philippe étancelin", tyre = "d"

3) Cross-check fetching both named drivers and their entrant/tyre
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, entrant, tyre FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix 
  WHERE driver ILIKE '%branca%' OR driver ILIKE '%étancelin%' OR driver ILIKE '%etancelin%';
- Results:
  - driver: toni branca; entrant: private; tyre: p
  - driver: philippe étancelin; entrant: private; tyre: d

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly two entries with entrant = 'private'.
- Those two entries are for drivers Toni Branca (tyre = p) and Philippe Étancelin (tyre = d).
- This matches the claim precisely.

Assumptions
- “Occasion” is interpreted as a row/entry in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix table (public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix).
- “Tyre p and d” refers to the tyre codes stored in the dataset; no external mapping of codes to manufacturers was assumed.
- Name matching for Étancelin accounted for both accented and unaccented variants to ensure robust retrieval.
