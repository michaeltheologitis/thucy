Claim being checked: “3 of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have 2 different uniform number.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered PostgreSQL source (TabFact) with table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
- Table schema (relevant columns):
  - quarterback (text)
  - uniform no (s) (text) — contains one or more uniform numbers (comma-separated)

Evidence from data
1) Inspect all quarterbacks and their uniform numbers
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, "uniform no (s)" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks ORDER BY quarterback;
Key rows showing multiple numbers in the “uniform no (s)” field:
- graham , otto — 60 , 14
- ninowski , jim — 15 , 11
- ratterman , george — 12 , 16

2) Count how many QBs have more than one distinct uniform number
SQL executed:
WITH nums AS (
  SELECT "quarterback", trim(n) AS num
  FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks,
       unnest(string_to_array("uniform no (s)", ',')) AS n
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS quarterbacks_with_multiple_numbers
FROM (
  SELECT "quarterback", COUNT(DISTINCT num) AS num_count
  FROM nums
  GROUP BY "quarterback"
) t
WHERE num_count > 1;
Result:
quarterbacks_with_multiple_numbers: 3

3) List the quarterbacks who have multiple distinct uniform numbers
SQL executed:
WITH nums AS (
  SELECT "quarterback", trim(n) AS num
  FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks,
       unnest(string_to_array("uniform no (s)", ',')) AS n
)
SELECT "quarterback", array_agg(DISTINCT num) AS numbers
FROM nums
GROUP BY "quarterback"
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT num) > 1
ORDER BY "quarterback";
Results:
- {"quarterback":"graham , otto", "numbers":["14","60"]}
- {"quarterback":"ninowski , jim", "numbers":["11","15"]}
- {"quarterback":"ratterman , george", "numbers":["12","16"]}

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 3 Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks in the table have more than one distinct uniform number. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “start quarterback” interpreted as “starting quarterbacks” listed in the table.
- “have 2 different uniform number” interpreted as having more than one distinct uniform number recorded in the “uniform no (s)” text field, parsed by splitting on commas and trimming whitespace.
