Claim to verify: “Maryland District 6 candidate Elton R. Wampler succeed incumbent candidate Goodloe Byron.”

What the data shows:
- Source: postgres_tabfact0 (TabFact) → public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
- The 1974 election entry for Maryland’s 6th congressional district lists Goodloe Byron as the incumbent and shows him re-elected. Elton R. Wampler is listed as the Republican challenger with a smaller vote share.

Evidence (executed SQL and result):
- SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, candidates, result
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  WHERE district ILIKE '%Maryland%' AND district ILIKE '%6%';
- Result returned:
  • District: maryland 6
  • Incumbent: goodloe byron
  • Candidates: goodloe byron (d) 73.7%; elton r wampler (r) 26.3%
  • Result: re - elected

Assessment:
- In the 1974 U.S. House election for Maryland’s 6th district, Goodloe Byron was re-elected; Elton R. Wampler did not succeed him. Therefore, the claim that Wampler succeeded Byron is contradicted by the available data.

Scope note:
- The available dataset includes the 1974 House election table. Within this scope, the claim is inaccurate. No additional years are available in the discovered data source to suggest otherwise.

Assumptions:
- “Succeed” is interpreted as “defeat the incumbent and take the seat.”
- The claim pertains to the 1974 U.S. House election for Maryland’s 6th district (the only year available in the connected dataset).
