Answer: 5th place (at the 1999 European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia).

Evidence from data
- Junior competitions and finishes found in the available table:
  - 1998 — World Junior Championships (Annecy, France) — position: 10th
  - 1999 — European Junior Championships (Riga, Latvia) — position: 5th
- Best (highest-ranked) junior finish: 5th

Executed SQL and results
1) Identify junior-event rows
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE lower(competition) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%u20%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%youth%'
   OR lower(notes) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(position) LIKE '%junior%';
Results:
- year: 1998 | competition: world junior championships | venue: annecy , france | position: 10th | notes: 61.51 m
- year: 1999 | competition: european junior championships | venue: riga , latvia | position: 5th | notes: 64.20 m

2) Extract numeric placements from the position field
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, position,
       regexp_replace(position, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS digits
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE lower(competition) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%u20%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%youth%'
   OR lower(notes) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(position) LIKE '%junior%';
Results:
- 1998 | world junior championships | position: 10th | digits: 10
- 1999 | european junior championships | position: 5th  | digits: 5

3) Compute best (minimum) numeric placement among junior events
SQL:
SELECT MIN((regexp_replace(position, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'))::int) AS best_place
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE lower(competition) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%u20%'
   OR lower(competition) LIKE '%youth%'
   OR lower(notes) LIKE '%junior%'
   OR lower(position) LIKE '%junior%';
Results:
- best_place: 5

Conclusion
- Lukáš Melich’s highest finish as a junior is 5th place, achieved at the 1999 European Junior Championships (Riga, Latvia).

Assumptions
- Junior events were identified by the presence of 'junior', 'u20', or 'youth' in competition, notes, or position fields (case-insensitive).
- Textual positions (e.g., '5th') were converted to numeric by stripping non-digits and casting to integer to determine best placement.
