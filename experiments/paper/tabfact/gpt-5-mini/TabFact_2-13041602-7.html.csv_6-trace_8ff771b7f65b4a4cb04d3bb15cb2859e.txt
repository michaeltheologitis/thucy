Claim interpreted: In 2005, the Milwaukee Brewers played the Astros after playing the Padres.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season (columns: date [text], opponent [text], score [text], loss [text], attendance [bigint], record [text])
- Note: The table’s date values are of the form "september N" and the table only contains September entries for the 2005 season.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify immediate next opponent after each Padres game in September
SQL executed:
WITH s AS (
  SELECT date,
         opponent,
         CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer) AS day,
         lead(opponent) OVER (ORDER BY CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer)) AS next_opponent,
         lead(date) OVER (ORDER BY CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer)) AS next_date
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
  WHERE date ILIKE 'september %'
)
SELECT date, day, opponent, next_date, next_opponent
FROM s
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Padres%'
ORDER BY day;
Key results:
- Sept 1 (opponent: Padres) -> next day Sept 2 (opponent: Padres)
- Sept 2 (opponent: Padres) -> next day Sept 3 (opponent: Padres)
- Sept 3 (opponent: Padres) -> next day Sept 4 (opponent: Padres)
- Sept 4 (opponent: Padres) -> next day Sept 5 (opponent: Reds)
Interpretation: Immediately after the Padres series concluded on Sept 4, the next opponent was the Reds on Sept 5 (not the Astros). 

2) List all Astros game days in September
SQL executed:
SELECT date, CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer) AS day, opponent, score, record
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'september %' AND opponent ILIKE '%Astros%'
ORDER BY day;
Key results:
- Astros games on Sept 9, 10, 11 and Sept 16, 17, 18
Interpretation: The Brewers did play the Astros later in September.

3) Compare ordering of the last Padres date and first Astros date
SQL executed:
SELECT
  MAX(CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer)) FILTER (WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Padres%') AS max_padres_day,
  MIN(CAST(split_part(date, ' ', 2) AS integer)) FILTER (WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Astros%') AS min_astros_day
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'september %';
Result:
- max_padres_day = 4
- min_astros_day = 9
Interpretation: The Padres series (Sept 1–4) occurred earlier than the Astros series (starting Sept 9), so the Astros were indeed played after the Padres during September 2005.

Findings
- True: In September 2005, the Brewers played the Astros after playing the Padres (Padres on Sept 1–4; Astros starting Sept 9).
- Nuance: The immediate opponent after the Padres series was the Reds (Sept 5–7). The Astros came later (Sept 9–11 and Sept 16–18).

Conclusion
- The claim that the Brewers played the Astros after the Padres in 2005 is supported by the September 2005 schedule in the available data. While not immediately following the Padres, the Astros series did occur later in the month.

Assumptions
- “After” is interpreted as occurring later in the schedule, not necessarily immediately next.
- Verification is based on the available September 2005 data in table t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season, which is taken as authoritative within its scope.
