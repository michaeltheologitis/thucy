Claim to verify: “the production number for episode 23 be 118.0.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public, table: the_baron. Columns include episode (bigint) and prod (bigint), which indicates the production number.

Evidence from data
1) What is the production number for episode 23?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, prod, title
  FROM public.the_baron
  WHERE episode = 23;
- Result:
  episode: 23
  prod: 120
  title: the edge of fear

2) Does any episode have production number 118 (i.e., 118.0)?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, prod, title FROM public.the_baron WHERE prod = 118;
- Result:
  episode: 21
  prod: 118
  title: the seven eyes of night

Conclusion
- The data shows episode 23 has production number 120, not 118 (or 118.0). Production number 118 corresponds to episode 21.

Assumptions
- “Production number” maps to the prod column in public.the_baron.
- The claim refers to the The Baron episode list in the available dataset. The prod column is integer; “118.0” is interpreted as 118 if intended as a numeric value.
