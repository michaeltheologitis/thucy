Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate relevant NFL season data.
- Identified a table specific to the 1993 New York Jets season with a “game site” field.
- Queried the table to count occurrences of each game site and specifically the count for “the meadowlands”.

Data source and schema
- Data source: PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact27), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), game site (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence 1: Distinct game sites and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT "game site", COUNT(*) AS games_played
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
GROUP BY "game site"
ORDER BY games_played DESC, "game site";

Result (excerpt):
- the meadowlands: 8
- foxboro stadium: 1
- giants stadium: 1
- houston astrodome: 1
- joe robbie stadium: 1
- los angeles memorial coliseum: 1
- rca dome: 1
- rich stadium: 1
- robert f kennedy memorial stadium: 1

Evidence 2: Exact count for “the meadowlands”
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE "game site" = 'the meadowlands';

Result:
count = 8

Supporting row-level check
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE "game site" = 'the meadowlands' ORDER BY week;

Returned rows (week | date | opponent | result | game site):
1 | 1993 - 09 - 05 | denver broncos | l 26 - 20 | the meadowlands
4 | 1993 - 09 - 26 | new england patriots | w 45 - 7 | the meadowlands
5 | 1993 - 10 - 03 | philadelphia eagles | l 35 - 30 | the meadowlands
8 | 1993 - 10 - 24 | buffalo bills | l 19 - 10 | the meadowlands
10 | 1993 - 11 - 07 | miami dolphins | w 27 - 10 | the meadowlands
12 | 1993 - 11 - 21 | cincinnati bengals | w 17 - 12 | the meadowlands
14 | 1993 - 12 - 05 | indianapolis colts | l 9 - 6 | the meadowlands
16 | 1993 - 12 - 18 | dallas cowboys | l 28 - 7 | the meadowlands

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 8 games with the game site listed as “the meadowlands” for the 1993 New York Jets season. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the meadowlands” as the exact text stored in the “game site” column; comparisons were case-sensitive and exact, matching the table’s entries.
- Treated the single table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season as authoritative for the 1993 season schedule and venues.
