Claim to verify: “10 of the players were transferred at the end of their contract.”

Scope and interpretation
- Data source: postgres_tabfact13 (public schema), which contains a single table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season.
- Interpreting “transferred at the end of their contract” as rows where the column type indicates end of contract.

Data source discovery
- Available table and columns:
  - public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text)

Evidence
1) Distribution of transfer types
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  GROUP BY type
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result summary:
  - loan — 20
  - end of contract — 7
  - transfer — 6

2) Count of players whose move was “end of contract” (case- and space-normalized)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE trim(lower(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result:
  count = 7

3) Players moved at end of contract (for transparency)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, type
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE trim(lower(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result (name | type):
  - nicholas gallacher | end of contract
  - lacine cherif | end of contract
  - alistair park | end of contract
  - michael donald | end of contract
  - calum reidford | end of contract
  - chris smith | end of contract
  - jeroen van den broeck | end of contract

Conclusion
- The data shows 7 players, not 10, were transferred at the end of their contract in this dataset. The claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- “Players” refers to rows in public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season.
- “Transferred at the end of their contract” corresponds to type values indicating “end of contract” (matched case-insensitively and trimmed).
