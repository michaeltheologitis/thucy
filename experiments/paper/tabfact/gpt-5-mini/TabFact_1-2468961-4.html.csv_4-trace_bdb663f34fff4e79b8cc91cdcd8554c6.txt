Summary
- Claim interpreted: Production code 455451 corresponds to an episode that originally aired on October 1, 1993.
- Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL database, table public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes (columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date [text], production code [bigint]).

Evidence 1: Lookup by production code
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "original air date", "production code" 
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE "production code" = 455451;
- Result:
  - title: the apartment
  - original air date: october 1 , 1993
  - production code: 455451
- Interpretation: The row with production code 455451 has an original air date of “october 1 , 1993,” which matches the claimed date (formatting and case aside).

Evidence 2: Cross-check by air date (case-insensitive with punctuation/spacing normalized)
- Executed SQL (normalization pass to identify matching rows and verify the date format):
SELECT title, "original air date", "production code", lower(regexp_replace("original air date", '[^a-z0-9]+', ' ', 'g')) AS normalized
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE lower("original air date") LIKE '%oct%' AND lower("original air date") LIKE '%1993%';
- Observation: The matching record’s normalized original air date equals "october 1 1993".

- Executed SQL (exact normalized match for October 1, 1993):
SELECT title, "original air date", "production code"
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE lower(regexp_replace("original air date", '[^a-z0-9]+', ' ', 'g')) = 'october 1 1993';
- Result:
  - Title: the apartment
  - Original air date (as stored): october 1 , 1993
  - Production code: 455451
- Interpretation: The only episode in the dataset whose normalized air date is October 1, 1993 has production code 455451, confirming the linkage from the date side as well.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that production code 455451 corresponds to the episode titled “the apartment,” which originally aired on October 1, 1993. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the TV series represented by public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes (Step by Step).
- Date matching allows for case and punctuation variations (e.g., "october 1 , 1993" equals "October 1, 1993").
