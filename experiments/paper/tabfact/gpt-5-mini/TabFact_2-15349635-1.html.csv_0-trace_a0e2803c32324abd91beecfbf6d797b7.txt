Claim interpreted: Two teams occupy positions 1 and 2 with the same number of points.

Data source explored: TabFact21 (public schema). Relevant table identified via schema inspection:
- t_1940_in_brazilian_football(position bigint, team text, points bigint, played bigint, against bigint, difference text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve teams, positions, and points for positions 1 and 2
SQL executed:
SELECT position, team, points FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position IN (1,2) ORDER BY position;
Result:
- position: 1, team: flamengo, points: 13
- position: 2, team: fluminense, points: 13

2) Verify positions 1 and 2 share the same points value
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT points FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position IN (1,2) ORDER BY points;
Result: 13

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT points) AS distinct_count FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position IN (1,2);
Result: 1

Conclusion
- The teams in positions 1 and 2 (Flamengo and Fluminense) both have 13 points. The distinct count of points among these two positions is 1. This supports the claim that the first two positions are held by teams with an equal number of points.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the standings represented in the table t_1940_in_brazilian_football within the TabFact21 database.
