Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One accessible PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact14) with a public schema containing a single table: public.brian_watts.

Schema details
- Tool: schema_query
- Table: public.brian_watts
  - Columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), "top - 5" (bigint), "top - 25" (bigint), events (bigint), "cuts made" (bigint)
  - No relationships, constraints, or comments listed.

Evidence 1: Tournaments and their event counts
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY tournament;
- Results (tournament — events):
  - masters tournament — 2
  - pga championship — 6
  - the open championship — 7
  - totals — 17
  - us open — 2

Evidence 2: Average events across all rows (including the 'totals' row)
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, SUM(events) AS total_events, AVG(events) AS avg_events FROM public.brian_watts;
- Result:
  - row_count = 5
  - total_events = 34
  - avg_events = 6.8

Evidence 3: Average events across only real tournaments (excluding the 'totals' row)
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS count, sum(events) AS sum_events, avg(events) AS avg_events FROM public.brian_watts WHERE lower(tournament) <> 'totals' AND events IS NOT NULL;
- Result:
  - count = 4
  - sum_events = 17
  - avg_events = 4.25

Assessment
- If we compute the average number of events across all listed rows, the average is 6.8, not 2.5.
- If we exclude the aggregate "totals" row and average only the actual tournaments, the average is 4.25, not 2.5.
- Under either reasonable interpretation, the claim that the tournaments have an average of 2.5 events is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "tournament list" as the rows in public.brian_watts and "average of 2.5 event" as the mean of the "events" column across those rows.
- Considered both including all rows and excluding the aggregate row labeled 'totals' to ensure a fair interpretation focused on actual tournaments.
