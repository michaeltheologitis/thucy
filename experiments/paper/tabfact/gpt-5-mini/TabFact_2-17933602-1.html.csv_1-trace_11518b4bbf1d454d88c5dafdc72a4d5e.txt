Claim to verify
- “the 15th in the liga of the 2003 - 2004 season be in Estádio do Restelo while the 13th in the liga be hold in Estádio Cidade de Coimbra.”

What I checked
- Which clubs are recorded as finishing 15th and 13th in the 2003–2004 Liga (Primeira Liga) and their associated stadiums in the available data.

Evidence from the data
1) Full table view to understand encoding of the 2003–2004 placements and stadiums
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT club, stadium, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga;
- Relevant returned rows (subset):
  - académica de coimbra | estádio cidade de coimbra | 13th in the liga
  - belenenses | estádio do restelo | 15th in the liga

2) Targeted check for the 15th-place team in 2003–2004
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT club, stadium, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" LIKE '%15%';
- Result:
  - club: belenenses | stadium: estádio do restelo | 2003 - 2004 season: 15th in the liga

3) Targeted check for the 13th-place team in 2003–2004
- Executed SQL (step 1 - confirm literal value):
  SELECT DISTINCT "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga ORDER BY "2003 - 2004 season";
  (Excerpt shows: "13th in the liga")
- Executed SQL (step 2 - fetch club and stadium):
  SELECT club, stadium FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" = '13th in the liga';
- Result:
  - club: académica de coimbra | stadium: estádio cidade de coimbra

Assessment
- The data explicitly shows:
  - 15th in the 2003–2004 Liga: Belenenses — stadium: Estádio do Restelo.
  - 13th in the 2003–2004 Liga: Académica de Coimbra — stadium: Estádio Cidade de Coimbra.
- This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Liga” refers to the Portuguese top division (Primeira Liga) for the 2003–2004 season, as encoded in the column "2003 - 2004 season" of table t_2004_05_primeira_liga.
- The stadium listed for each club in this table corresponds to that club’s stadium at the time referenced by the season placement text.
