Summary
- Claim evaluated: "australia receive 0 gold medal and more than 1 bronze."
- Context: Based on available data sources, the only relevant dataset is a medal table for the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships. I interpret the claim as referring to this event.

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23), schema public.
- Identified table: public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships with columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Executed query and evidence
- Purpose: Retrieve Australia’s medal counts.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE nation = 'australia';
- Result:
  { "nation": "australia", "gold": 0, "silver": 0, "bronze": 1, "total": 1 }

Assessment against the claim
- "0 gold medal": Supported. Data shows gold = 0.
- "more than 1 bronze": Not supported. Data shows bronze = 1 (not more than 1).

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct element (0 gold) with an incorrect one (more than 1 bronze). Therefore, it is not fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring specifically to the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships, as this is the only available medal-tally dataset in the accessible data sources. If the intent was a different event or time period, that data is not present in the current environment.
