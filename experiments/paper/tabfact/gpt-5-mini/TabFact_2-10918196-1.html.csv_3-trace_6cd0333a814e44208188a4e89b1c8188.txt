Claim to verify: "the new york jet play the denver bronco before the miami dolphins during the 1993 season"

Summary conclusion: The 1993 New York Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1 and the Miami Dolphins in Weeks 2 and 10. Therefore, the Jets did play the Denver Broncos before playing the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 season.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: TabFact (postgres_tabfact30) database with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season with columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full 1993 New York Jets schedule (ordered by week)
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season ORDER BY week ASC;
Key returned rows (excerpt):
- Week 1 | 1993 - 09 - 05 | denver broncos | l 26 - 20 | the meadowlands

2b) Only Denver Broncos and Miami Dolphins games, ordered by week
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE opponent IN ('denver broncos', 'miami dolphins') ORDER BY week ASC;
Returned rows:
- 1 | 1993 - 09 - 05 | denver broncos | l 26 - 20
- 2 | 1993 - 09 - 12 | miami dolphins | w 24 - 14
- 10 | 1993 - 11 - 07 | miami dolphins | w 27 - 10

Interpretation
- The Jets faced the Denver Broncos in Week 1, which precedes both Week 2 and Week 10 games versus the Miami Dolphins. Therefore, the statement that the Jets played the Broncos before the Dolphins during the 1993 season is supported by the schedule data.

Assumptions
- "Before" refers to chronological order within the regular season schedule (by week/date) and requires at least one occurrence of a Denver game scheduled earlier than a Miami game.
- The table represents the 1993 regular season schedule and results for the New York Jets; preseason and postseason are out of scope unless included in the table (they are not evident here).
