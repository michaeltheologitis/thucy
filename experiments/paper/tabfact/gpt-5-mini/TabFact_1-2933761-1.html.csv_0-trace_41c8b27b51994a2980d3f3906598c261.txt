Claim to verify: "the both female character in the cube have a status of dead"

Data source discovery:
- Accessible relational source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.cube_film_series with columns: name, occupation, gender, prison connection, played by, status.

Executed SQL evidence:
- SQL:
  SELECT name, gender, status FROM public.cube_film_series;

Results excerpt (name — gender — status):
- joan leaven — female — dead
- dr helen holloway — female — dead
- Additional context from the same query (for completeness): kazan — male — alive after exiting the cube; david worth — male — dead; quentin — male — dead; rennes — male — dead.

Assessment:
- The table lists two female characters associated with Cube: Joan Leaven and Dr Helen Holloway.
- Both female entries have status recorded as "dead".

Conclusion:
- The claim is fully supported by the data returned from the authoritative table in the available database.

Assumptions:
- "in the cube" refers to the 1997 film Cube represented by the characters present in public.cube_film_series. The table does not include an explicit film column, but the listed characters correspond to the first film and suffice to evaluate the claim as stated.
