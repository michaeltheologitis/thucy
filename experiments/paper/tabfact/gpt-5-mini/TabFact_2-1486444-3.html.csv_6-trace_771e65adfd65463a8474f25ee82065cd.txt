Claim interpreted: “PRIDE Bushido 10 never had a KO (knee) method.”

Finding: The available data shows that at PRIDE Bushido 10, Joachim Hansen defeated Luiz Azeredo by “ko (knee).” This directly contradicts the claim.

Evidence from the database
- Query 1: Retrieve any entries for the event containing “Bushido 10”
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time, location
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE event ILIKE '%Bushido 10%';
  
  Result (1 row):
  res: win
  opponent: luiz azeredo
  method: ko (knee)
  event: pride bushido 10
  round: 1
  time: 7:09
  location: tokyo , japan

- Query 2: Count and list distinct matches where event contains “Bushido 10” and method contains “ko (knee)”
  Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE event ILIKE '%Bushido 10%'
    AND method ILIKE '%ko (knee)%';
  
  Count result: match_count = 1
  
  Executed SQL (distinct event/method):
  SELECT DISTINCT event, method
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE event ILIKE '%Bushido 10%'
    AND method ILIKE '%ko (knee)%'
  ORDER BY event, method;
  
  Distinct result:
  event: pride bushido 10, method: ko (knee)

Conclusion: The data shows at least one fight at PRIDE Bushido 10 ended by “ko (knee).” Therefore, the claim that the event “never had” a KO (knee) method is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to whether any bout at PRIDE Bushido 10 ended by KO via knee strikes.
- The dataset available contains Joachim Hansen’s bout records; since it includes a PRIDE Bushido 10 bout with “ko (knee),” this is sufficient to refute a universal “never” statement for that event.
