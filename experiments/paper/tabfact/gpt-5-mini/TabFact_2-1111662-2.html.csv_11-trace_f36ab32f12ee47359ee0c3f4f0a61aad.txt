Claim to check: “the date of the discus throw for bulgaria be after Sep 5, 1986.”

What I checked
- Located entries for the discus throw where the athlete’s nationality is Bulgaria in the available athletics table (public.memorial_van_damme).
- Retrieved the stored date and compared it to 1986-09-05 by parsing the textual date.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Identify the Bulgaria discus throw row:
SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE nationality ILIKE 'Bulgaria' AND event ILIKE '%discus%';
Result:
[{"event":"discus throw","record":"69.84 m","athlete":"tsvetanka christova","nationality":"bulgaria","date":"5 september 1986"}]

2) Parse and compare the date to 1986-09-05:
SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date AS stored_date, to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, CASE WHEN to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') < DATE '1986-09-05' THEN 'before' WHEN to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') = DATE '1986-09-05' THEN 'equal' ELSE 'after' END AS comparison_to_1986_09_05 FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE nationality ILIKE 'Bulgaria' AND event ILIKE '%discus%';
Result:
[{"event":"discus throw","record":"69.84 m","athlete":"tsvetanka christova","nationality":"bulgaria","stored_date":"5 september 1986","parsed_date":"1986-09-05T00:00:00Z","comparison_to_1986_09_05":"equal"}]

Findings
- The only Bulgaria discus throw entry found is dated 5 September 1986, which equals (not after) September 5, 1986.

Conclusion
- The claim that the date “be after Sep 5, 1986” is not supported. The date is equal to Sep 5, 1986, not after.

Assumptions
- “discus throw for bulgaria” refers to the row in public.memorial_van_damme with event containing “discus” and nationality matching “Bulgaria.”
- The stored textual date uses the format parsable by to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY').
