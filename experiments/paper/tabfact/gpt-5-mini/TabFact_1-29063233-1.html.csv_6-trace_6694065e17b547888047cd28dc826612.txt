Claim to verify: “david moore direct 5 episode of series 2 of merlin.”

Interpretation: The phrasing is ambiguous. I interpret it as “David Moore directed episode 5 of Series 2 of Merlin.” I also check the alternative reading “David Moore directed 5 episodes in Series 2 of Merlin.”

Data source examined
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact2)
- Schema: public
- Table: merlin_series_2
  - Columns: "no overall" (bigint), "no for series" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "uk viewers (million)" (double precision)

Evidence
1) Find all Series 2 episodes directed by David Moore (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT "no for series", title, "directed by" FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%david moore%';
Result rows:
- 1 — the curse of cornelius sigan — david moore
- 4 — lancelot and guinevere — david moore
- 5 — beauty and the beast (part 1) — david moore

2) Count how many Series 2 episodes list David Moore as director
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE lower("directed by") LIKE '%david moore%';
Result:
- count: 3

3) Retrieve Series 2, episode 5 details
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE "no for series" = 5;
Result row:
- no overall: 18
- no for series: 5
- title: beauty and the beast (part 1)
- directed by: david moore
- written by: jake michie
- original air date: 24 october 2009
- uk viewers (million): 5.53

Conclusion
- The data shows that David Moore is credited as director for episode 5 of Series 2 (Beauty and the Beast, Part 1). This verifies the interpretation “David Moore directed episode 5 of Series 2 of Merlin.”
- If the intended claim was that he directed 5 episodes in Series 2, that is contradicted by the data; he is credited for 3 episodes (episodes 1, 4, and 5).

Assumptions
- I interpreted “5 episode” as “episode 5.” If instead it meant “five episodes,” the claim would be inaccurate based on the evidence above.
