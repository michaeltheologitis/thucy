Conclusion: The claim is supported by the available data. In the 1954 VFL season table, the only match where Essendon is the away team lists a crowd (attendance) of 28,158.

Evidence from the database
- Data source discovery: A single accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema was found. Within it, table public.t_1954_vfl_season contains columns: home team, away team, venue, crowd, date.

1) List the match(es) where Essendon is the away team
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "away team" = 'essendon';

Result:
- date: 31 july 1954 | home team: geelong | away team: essendon | venue: kardinia park | crowd: 28158

2) Confirm count and range of crowds for Essendon-away matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count, min(crowd) AS min_crowd, max(crowd) AS max_crowd
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE lower(trim("away team")) = 'essendon';

Result:
- match_count: 1 | min_crowd: 28158 | max_crowd: 28158

Assessment
- The only Essendon-away match in this dataset has a crowd of 28,158. This directly matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “Crowd” refers to the attendance value stored in the crowd column.
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (public.t_1954_vfl_season, 1954 VFL season).
