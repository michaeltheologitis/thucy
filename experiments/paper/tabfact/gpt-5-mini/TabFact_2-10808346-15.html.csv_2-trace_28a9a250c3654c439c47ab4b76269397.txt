Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Richmond, as the home team scoring 9.10 (64), was the home opponent in a match where Melbourne was the away team.

Data checked: public.t_1943_vfl_season (TabFact Postgres). This table lists VFL 1943 season matches with home/away teams and scores.

Evidence
1) Directly check Richmond (home) vs Melbourne (away)
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","date" FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE "away team"='melbourne' AND "home team"='richmond';
Result:
- home team: richmond; home team score: 15.19 (109); away team: melbourne; away team score: 12.13 (85); venue: punt road oval; date: 21 august 1943
Interpretation: The Richmond vs Melbourne (Richmond home, Melbourne away) match exists in 1943, but the home team score was 15.19 (109), not 9.10 (64).

2) Check if any match has away team = Melbourne and home team score = 9.10 (64)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE LOWER("away team") = 'melbourne' AND "home team score" = '9.10 (64)';
Result: match_count = 0
Interpretation: No such match in the 1943 dataset.

3) Identify which match(es) actually have the home team score 9.10 (64)
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE "home team score" = '9.10 (64)' LIMIT 50;
Result:
- home team: footscray; home team score: 9.10 (64); away team: essendon; away team score: 6.15 (51); date: 21 august 1943; venue: western oval
Interpretation: The 9.10 (64) home score appears for Footscray vs Essendon, not Richmond vs Melbourne.

Conclusion
The available data shows that when Melbourne was the away team against Richmond in 1943, Richmond (home) scored 15.19 (109), not 9.10 (64). There are zero matches in this dataset where Melbourne was the away team and the home team scored 9.10 (64). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (public.t_1943_vfl_season), which covers the 1943 VFL season.
- Team names and score strings are matched as stored (lowercase team names, score format like 'goals.behinds (total)').
