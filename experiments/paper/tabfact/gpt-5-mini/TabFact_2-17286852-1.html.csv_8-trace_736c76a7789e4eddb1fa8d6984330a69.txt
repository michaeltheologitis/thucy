Claim to verify: “Colton’s Crossing Bridge is a Pratt through truss in Adams County.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact10 (public schema)
- Table: public.my_info_table with columns [name text, listed text, location text, county text, type text]

What the data shows
- The table contains an entry for “colton ’s crossing bridge” with type “pratt through truss,” county “ransom,” and location “lisbon.” This indicates the bridge is a Pratt through truss located in Ransom County (Lisbon), not in Adams County.

Executed SQL queries and evidence
1) Broader name search ignoring apostrophes to find “Colton’s Crossing Bridge”
SQL:
SELECT name, type, county, location
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(name, '''', ''), '’', '') ILIKE '%coltons crossing bridge%'
   OR REPLACE(REPLACE(name, '''', ''), '’', '') ILIKE '%colton crossing bridge%';
Result: 0 rows

2) Broader pattern search for colton%cross%bridge (case-insensitive, ignoring apostrophes)
SQL:
SELECT name, type, county, location
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(name, '''', ''), '’', '') ILIKE '%colton%cross%bridge%';
Result: 1 row
- name: colton 's crossing bridge
- type: pratt through truss
- county: ransom
- location: lisbon

3) Direct phrase search for names like “colton … crossing … bridge”
SQL:
SELECT name, type, county, location FROM my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%colton%crossing%bridge%';
Result: 1 row
- name: colton 's crossing bridge | type: pratt through truss | county: ransom | location: lisbon

4) Check for any matches in an Adams County
SQL:
SELECT name, type, county, location FROM my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%colton''s crossing%';
Result: 0 rows

Conclusion
- Type: Supported. The bridge listed is a “pratt through truss.”
- County: Not supported. The only matching record places it in Ransom County (Lisbon), not Adams County. No entries for this bridge were found in Adams County.

Assumptions
- “Adams County” was interpreted generically (any Adams County) since the dataset’s county field contains only the county name without state. No match was found for this bridge in an Adams County.
- Case-insensitive matching was used; apostrophes were normalized to avoid punctuation mismatches.
- All conclusions are based solely on the postgres_tabfact10.public.my_info_table data available.
