Summary
- Claim interpreted: “In 3 of the games, no goal was scored by either side.” I interpret this as asserting there are exactly three 0-0 matches in the available dataset.

Data sources discovered
- Using discovery, I found one accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public.

Schema examined
- Table: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)
  - This table records match-level results for Sheffield Wednesday F.C.’s 2000–01 season.

Evidence 1: Distinct result counts show exactly three 0 - 0 games
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS sample_count
  FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  GROUP BY result
  ORDER BY sample_count DESC, result;
- Relevant output excerpt:
  - 0 - 0 — 3
- Interpretation: The result string “0 - 0” occurs exactly 3 times.

Evidence 2: Direct count of 0 - 0 results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_zero_zero
  FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  WHERE result = '0 - 0';
- Result: count_zero_zero = 3

Evidence 3: Listing the specific 0 - 0 matches
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result
  FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  WHERE result ~ '(^|[^0-9])0[^0-9]+0([^0-9]|$)'
  ORDER BY date;
- Returned rows:
  - 30 december 2000 — huddersfield town — a — 0 - 0
  - 7 march 2001 — portsmouth — h — 0 - 0
  - 6 may 2001 — crewe alexandra — h — 0 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows there are exactly three matches that ended 0-0 in the available season table. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Because only one relevant table was available, I assumed the claim refers to the matches recorded in public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (Sheffield Wednesday F.C., 2000–01 season).
- I treated “no goal was scored by either side” as synonymous with a 0-0 final score.
