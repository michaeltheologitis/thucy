Claim interpreted: The only gameplay dates in 2003 are “25 - 26 january 2003” and “12 - 13 july 2003.” We verify this against the available TabFact database table public.tsuyoshi_fujita.

Data source discovery
- Available DB: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Table: public.tsuyoshi_fujita
- Columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any rows explicitly labeled season = '2003'
SQL:
SELECT "event type", location, format, date, rank
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE season = '2003'
ORDER BY date NULLS LAST, "event type";
Result: No rows returned.

2) Find all rows whose date contains '2003'
SQL:
SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';
Results:
- season: 2002 - 03 | event type: grand prix | location: hiroshima | format: extended | date: 25 - 26 january 2003 | rank: 7
- season: 2002 - 03 | event type: grand prix | location: bangkok  | format: standard | date: 12 - 13 july 2003  | rank: 1

3) Count and list distinct 2003 date values to confirm exclusivity
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2003 FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';
Result: count_2003 = 2

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date LIKE '%2003%' ORDER BY date;
Results:
- 25 - 26 january 2003
- 12 - 13 july 2003

Assessment
- The only rows in the table whose date falls in 2003 are exactly “25 - 26 january 2003” and “12 - 13 july 2003.” No other 2003 dates are present. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Game play in 2003” is interpreted as entries in public.tsuyoshi_fujita whose date text contains the year “2003.” The season label is textual and may span years (e.g., “2002 - 03”).
