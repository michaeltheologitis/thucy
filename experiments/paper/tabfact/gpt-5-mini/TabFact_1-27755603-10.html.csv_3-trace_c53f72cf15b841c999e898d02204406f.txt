Claim to verify: “the detroit piston have their lowest game attendance during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season on march 1 against milwaukee at the bradley center.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
  - Notes: attendance is embedded in the “location attendance” text; dates are text.

Step 1: Inspect rows and extract numeric attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance",'[^0-9]','','g'),'')::bigint AS attendance_num
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
ORDER BY date;

Key returned rows (ordered by the text date):
- march 1 | milwaukee | bradley center 11364 | 11364
- march 2 | minnesota | the palace of auburn hills 13122 | 13122
- march 6 | washington | the palace of auburn hills 17506 | 17506
- march 9 | san antonio | at&t center 18581 | 18581
- march 11 | oklahoma city | oklahoma city arena 18203 | 18203
- march 12 | denver | pepsi center 19155 | 19155
- march 16 | toronto | the palace of auburn hills 15166 | 15166
- march 18 | new york | the palace of auburn hills 22076 | 22076
- march 20 | atlanta | philips arena 17580 | 17580
- march 23 | miami | the palace of auburn hills 22076 | 22076
- march 25 | cleveland | quicken loans arena 19907 | 19907
- march 26 | indiana | the palace of auburn hills 19216 | 19216

Step 2: Compute the minimum attendance across the period covered by this table
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int) AS min_att
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') <> '';

Result:
- min_att: 11364

Step 3: Retrieve the game(s) with that minimum attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS attendance_numeric
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int = (
  SELECT MIN(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int)
  FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
)
ORDER BY date;

Result:
- date: march 1 | team: milwaukee | location attendance: bradley center 11364 | attendance_numeric: 11364

Conclusion
- The data show that the lowest attendance in the period covered by the table is 11,364, occurring on March 1 against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “This period” is interpreted as the set of games represented in the available table (which contains Detroit Pistons games in March of the 2010–2011 season). The table does not include the entire season; conclusions are grounded strictly on the games present in this dataset.
- Numeric attendance is parsed from the “location attendance” text by removing non-digits and casting to integer.
