Summary
- Claim interpreted: Subsidiaries are primarily located in the United Kingdom.
- Data source explored: TabFact database, public schema, table public.klm, which lists KLM Group entities (companies), their type (e.g., subsidiary), and jurisdiction of incorporation.
- Finding: Among subsidiaries in this dataset, the majority are incorporated in the Netherlands, not the United Kingdom.

Data discovery
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table "klm".

Schema inspection (evidence)
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Result: Table public.klm has columns: company (text), type (text), principal activities (text), incorporated in (text), group 's equity shareholding (text).

Context sample (evidence)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "company","type","principal activities","incorporated in","group 's equity shareholding" FROM public.klm LIMIT 5;
Result (sample):
- cobalt ground solutions | subsidiary | ground handling | united kingdom | 60%
- cygnific | subsidiary | sales and service | netherlands | 100%
- epcor | subsidiary | maintenance | netherlands | 100%
- high speed alliance | joint venture | high speed trains | netherlands | 5% (10% voting right)
- kenya airways | associate | airline | kenya | 27%

Key verification queries and results
1) Distinct types and jurisdictions (to understand categories)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "type" FROM public.klm ORDER BY "type";
Result: associate; joint controlled entity; joint venture; subsidiary

Executed SQL:
SELECT "incorporated in", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.klm GROUP BY "incorporated in" ORDER BY count DESC, "incorporated in";
Result: netherlands=12; united kingdom=3; france=1; kenya=1; taiwan=1

2) Subsidiaries only: counts by incorporation country
Executed SQL:
SELECT "incorporated in", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.klm
WHERE type = 'subsidiary'
GROUP BY "incorporated in"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- netherlands: 10
- united kingdom: 3
- taiwan: 1

3) Total number of subsidiaries
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_subsidiaries
FROM public.klm
WHERE type = 'subsidiary';
Result: 14

4) Which subsidiaries are in the United Kingdom
Executed SQL:
SELECT company
FROM public.klm
WHERE type = 'subsidiary'
  AND "incorporated in" ILIKE '%United Kingdom%'
ORDER BY company;
Result: cobalt ground solutions; klm cityhopper uk; klm uk engineering

Assessment
- Among subsidiaries in this dataset (n=14), only 3 are incorporated in the United Kingdom (21.4%), while 10 are incorporated in the Netherlands (71.4%). Therefore, subsidiaries are not primarily located (by incorporation) in the UK.

Conclusion
- The claim that subsidiaries are primarily located in the UK is not supported by the data from the available source.

Assumptions
- "Primarily located" is interpreted as the jurisdiction where each subsidiary is incorporated (column "incorporated in").
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the accessible dataset (public.klm), which represents KLM Group entities. No broader external datasets were accessible.
