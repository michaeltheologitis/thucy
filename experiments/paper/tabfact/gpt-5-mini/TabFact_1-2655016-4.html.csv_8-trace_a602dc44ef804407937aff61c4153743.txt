Claim: “each of the episode title have letter somewhere within the title.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact23 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table discovered: public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  - Columns: season, series, episode title, original air date, nick prod

What I checked
- Whether every value in column "episode title" contains at least one alphabetic character (A–Z or a–z).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of episodes
- Result: 18
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes;

2) Count of episodes whose titles contain at least one alphabetic letter
- Result: 16
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episodes_with_letter FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE "episode title" ~ '[A-Za-z]';

3) Titles that contain no alphabetic letters (evidence of exceptions)
- Results (distinct values):
  - 112
  - 702
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "episode title" FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE NOT (COALESCE("episode title", '') ~ '[A-Za-z]') ORDER BY "episode title" NULLS FIRST;

Conclusion
- Not every episode title contains an alphabetic letter; at least two titles (“112”, “702”) contain no letters. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “have letter” to mean “contains at least one alphabetic character (A–Z or a–z).”
- Verification performed against the available authoritative dataset: public.list_of_all_that_episodes.
