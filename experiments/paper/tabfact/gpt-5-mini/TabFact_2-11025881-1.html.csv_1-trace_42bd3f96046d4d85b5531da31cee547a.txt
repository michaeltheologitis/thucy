Data source overview
- Accessible database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships (columns: rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places)

Evidence
1) Identify the top 6 finishers and their nations
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, name, nation FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships ORDER BY rank ASC LIMIT 6;
Result:
- 1 — mark cockerell (united states)
- 2 — takashi mura (japan)
- 3 — brian pockar (canada)
- 4 — norbert schramm (west germany)
- 5 — andrew bestwick (united kingdom)
- 6 — stephan bril (west germany)
Observation: West Germany appears twice in the top 6 (ranks 4 and 6).

2) Count West Germany entries in the top 6 and list their ranks
SQL executed:
SELECT "rank", name, nation
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE lower(nation) = 'west germany' AND "rank" <= 6
ORDER BY "rank";
Result:
- { rank: 4, name: "norbert schramm", nation: "west germany" }
- { rank: 6, name: "stephan bril", nation: "west germany" }

SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS west_germany_top6_count
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE lower(nation) = 'west germany' AND "rank" <= 6;
Result:
- { west_germany_top6_count: 2 }

3) Check whether any medalists (ranks 1–3) are from West Germany
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE rank BETWEEN 1 AND 3
ORDER BY rank;
Result:
- { rank: 1, name: "mark cockerell", nation: "united states", "sp + fs": 1, points: 172.42, places: 11 }
- { rank: 2, name: "takashi mura", nation: "japan", "sp + fs": 2, points: 165.7, places: 24 }
- { rank: 3, name: "brian pockar", nation: "canada", "sp + fs": 3, points: 166.62, places: 23 }

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS west_germany_medalists
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
WHERE rank BETWEEN 1 AND 3 AND lower(nation) = 'west germany';
Result:
- { west_germany_medalists: 0 }
Observation: None of the medalists are from West Germany.

Conclusion
- The data shows West Germany has 2 athletes in the top 6 (ranks 4 and 6) and zero medalists (no one in ranks 1–3). The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Top 6” interpreted as the six lowest rank values (1–6).
- “Medal” interpreted as finishing in ranks 1–3.
- The claim pertains to the results represented in the table public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships.
