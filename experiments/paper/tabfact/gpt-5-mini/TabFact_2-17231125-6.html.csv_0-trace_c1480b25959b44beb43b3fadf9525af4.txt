Summary of verification:
- I explored the available data sources and found a single relevant table: public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf in the TabFact PostgreSQL instance, which lists placements and players for the 1988 U.S. Open Golf.
- I queried this table to identify any players tied for 5th place.

Evidence from data:
- Result shows two players with place = t5: larry mize and d a weibring.

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT place, player FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE place ILIKE '%T5%' OR place ILIKE '%5T%' OR place ILIKE '%T 5%' OR place ILIKE '%5 T%';

Query result (relevant fields):
- place: t5, player: larry mize
- place: t5, player: d a weibring

Conclusion:
- The data confirms that Larry Mize and D. A. Weibring were tied for 5th place (t5) at the 1988 U.S. Open Golf.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (1988 U.S. Open Golf). The text “d a be” is assumed to refer to D. A. Weibring, matching the dataset’s player entry.
