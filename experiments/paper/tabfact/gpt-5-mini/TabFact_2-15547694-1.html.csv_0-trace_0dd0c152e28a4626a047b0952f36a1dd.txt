Summary conclusion: Verified by data from the TabFact database (public schema), which contains a table of the 5th Seanad membership broken down by panel. The “total” row in that table shows Agricultural Panel = 11 and Labour Panel = 11.

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: members_of_the_5th_seanad
  Columns include: party, administrative panel, agricultural panel, cultural and educational panel, industrial and commercial panel, labour panel, national university of ireland, university of dublin, nominated by the taoiseach, total

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect all rows to observe structure and presence of a “total” row
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Key returned rows (abridged):
- party = total; agricultural panel = 11; labour panel = 11; (other totals also present)

2) Retrieve the totals explicitly from the “total” row
SQL:
SELECT "agricultural panel", "labour panel" FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party = 'total';
Result:
- agricultural panel = 11
- labour panel = 11

Notes:
- A naive sum across all rows (including the “total” row) would overcount. The authoritative values are those provided in the table’s “total” row, which directly reports the total number of members per panel.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the counts of members elected via the Agricultural Panel and the Labour Panel for the 5th Seanad as represented in the provided data table.
