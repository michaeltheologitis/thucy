Claim to verify: "there be 13 tour match in the last 3 month of 1978"

Data source discovery
- Available data: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17) database with a public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland

Schema context
- Table: t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  - Columns: "opposing team" (text), against (bigint), date (text), venue (text), status (text)

Step 1: Confirm possible match types and date format
- SQL (distinct status values):
  SELECT DISTINCT status FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland ORDER BY status;
  Result: test match; tour match

- SQL (sample of dates to confirm format):
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland ORDER BY date LIMIT 30;
  Sample result includes: 18 october 1978; 21 october 1978; 31 october 1978; 7 november 1978; 2 december 1978; 16 december 1978 (dates are stored as text like 'DD month YYYY').

Step 2: Count tour matches between Oct 1, 1978 and Dec 31, 1978
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS tour_match_count
  FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  WHERE status = 'tour match'
    AND to_date(date, 'DD month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-12-31';
  Result: tour_match_count = 14

Step 3: List the tour matches in that period (verification)
- SQL (list rows):
  SELECT date, "opposing team", venue
  FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  WHERE status = 'tour match'
    AND to_date(date, 'DD month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-12-31'
  ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD month YYYY');
  Result (14 rows):
  - 18 october 1978 — cambridge university — grange road , cambridge
  - 21 october 1978 — cardiff — cardiff arms park , cardiff
  - 25 october 1978 — west wales xv — st helen 's , swansea
  - 28 october 1978 — london counties — twickenham , london
  - 31 october 1978 — munster — thomond park , limerick
  - 7 november 1978 — ulster — ravenhill , belfast
  - 15 november 1978 — south and south - west counties — memorial ground , bristol
  - 18 november 1978 — midland counties — welford road , leicester
  - 21 november 1978 — combined services — aldershot military stadium , aldershot
  - 29 november 1978 — monmouthshire — rodney parade , newport
  - 2 december 1978 — north of england — birkenhead park , birkenhead
  - 5 december 1978 — north and midland of scotland — linksfield stadium , aberdeen
  - 13 december 1978 — bridgend — brewery field , bridgend
  - 16 december 1978 — barbarians — cardiff arms park , cardiff

Step 4: Cross-check counts by month and status
- SQL (grouped summary):
  SELECT extract(month FROM to_date(initcap(date), 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'))::int AS month_num,
         to_char(to_date(initcap(date), 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'), 'Mon') AS month_abbr,
         status, COUNT(*) AS matches
  FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  WHERE to_date(initcap(date), 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-12-31'
  GROUP BY month_num, month_abbr, status
  ORDER BY month_num, status;
  Results:
  - Oct: tour match = 5
  - Nov: tour match = 5; test match = 3
  - Dec: tour match = 4; test match = 1
  Cross-check: 5 + 5 + 4 = 14 tour matches in Oct–Dec 1978

Conclusion
- The data shows 14 tour matches in the last three months (Oct–Dec) of 1978, not 13. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- "tour match" corresponds to rows where status = 'tour match'.
- "last 3 month of 1978" is interpreted as October, November, and December 1978.
- The relevant context is the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland, as represented by the available table.
