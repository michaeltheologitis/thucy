Claim to verify: The New York Jets had the same number of wins and losses during the 1993 season.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season (Season-level game log for the 1993 New York Jets)
  Columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance

Evidence collected:
1) Distinct result values and counts (to validate parsing of wins/losses)
SQL executed:
SELECT result, count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
GROUP BY result
ORDER BY cnt DESC, result;

Query results (each appears once; 16 total):
- l 16 - 14 — 1
- l 19 - 10 — 1
- l 24 - 0 — 1
- l 24 - 20 — 1
- l 26 - 20 — 1
- l 28 - 7 — 1
- l 35 - 30 — 1
- l 9 - 6 — 1
- w 10 - 6 — 1
- w 17 - 12 — 1
- w 24 - 14 — 1
- w 27 - 10 — 1
- w 3 - 0 — 1
- w 31 - 17 — 1
- w 45 - 7 — 1
- w 6 - 0 — 1

Interpretation: The result column uses a leading lowercase 'w' or 'l' to denote wins or losses.

2) Aggregate count of wins, losses, ties, and total games
SQL executed:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN UPPER(LEFT(TRIM(result),1))='W' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN UPPER(LEFT(TRIM(result),1))='L' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
  SUM(CASE WHEN UPPER(LEFT(TRIM(result),1)) IN ('T','D') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ties,
  COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;

Query result:
- wins: 8
- losses: 8
- ties: 0
- total_games: 16

Conclusion:
- The 1993 New York Jets finished with 8 wins and 8 losses, i.e., the same number of wins and losses.

Assumptions:
- A game is considered a win if the trimmed result string begins with 'W' or 'w', and a loss if it begins with 'L' or 'l'. No ties were present in the data.
