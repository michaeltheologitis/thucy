Claim interpreted: The opponent in the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, on a hard surface was Katerina Kramperová.

What I checked
- Located the relevant dataset (TabFact PostgreSQL) containing the table public.leanne_baker with columns: outcome, date, location, surface, opponent in final, score.
- Queried for the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand, on a hard surface, and retrieved the listed opponent in final.
- Additionally searched for any finals listing an opponent named Kramperová to see if such a matchup exists on another date.

Evidence
1) Opponent for the final on 6 February 2000 in Wellington, New Zealand (hard surface)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, surface, "opponent in final" FROM public.leanne_baker
WHERE location ILIKE '%wellington%' AND surface ILIKE '%hard%'
  AND date ~* '(^|[^0-9])6(st|nd|rd|th)?[[:space:]-]*(feb|february)[[:space:]-]*2000';

Result:
- date: 6 february 2000
- location: wellington , new zealand
- surface: hard
- opponent in final: mirielle dittmann

2) Any finals against Kramperová in the dataset (to check for possible date mix-up)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, surface, "opponent in final" FROM leanne_baker WHERE "opponent in final" ILIKE '%kramperov%';

Result:
- 12 February 2006 | wellington, new zealand | hard | opponent in final: katerina kramperová

Conclusion
- The data shows that on 6 February 2000 in Wellington on hard courts, the opponent in the final was Mirielle Dittmann, not Katerina Kramperová.
- There is a separate final in Wellington on hard courts where the opponent was Katerina Kramperová, but it occurred on 12 February 2006, not in 2000.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a tennis final recorded in the public.leanne_baker table and that the phrasing "be katerina kramperová" asserts she was the opponent in that specific final/date/location/surface.
