Claim being checked: “the game play against the slough jet on the 2nd , be attend by 320 fan.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact23 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season (2008–09 Guildford Flames season). Columns include: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (text), competition (text), "man of the match" (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Query to list all games vs Slough and their details
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition
  FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Slough%'
  ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  - date: 1st; opponent: slough jets; venue: home; result: lost 2 - 3; attendance: 1308; competition: league / cup
  - date: 2nd; opponent: slough jets; venue: away; result: lost 5 - 6 (ot); attendance: 320; competition: league
- Interpretation: The row for date = "2nd" (opponent: slough jets) shows attendance = 320.

2) Targeted attendance retrieval for Slough games
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%slough%';
- Result rows:
  - {"date":"1st","opponent":"slough jets","attendance":"1308"}
  - {"date":"2nd","opponent":"slough jets","attendance":"320"}
- Interpretation: Confirms that for the game vs slough jets on the “2nd,” attendance is 320.

Conclusion
- The data explicitly shows that the game against Slough Jets on the “2nd” had an attendance of 320. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “Slough jet” refers to the team recorded as “slough jets.”
- “on the 2nd” refers to the row where the date field equals “2nd” (the table stores day-of-month text rather than a full calendar date).
- “fan” refers to the attendance count recorded in the attendance column.
