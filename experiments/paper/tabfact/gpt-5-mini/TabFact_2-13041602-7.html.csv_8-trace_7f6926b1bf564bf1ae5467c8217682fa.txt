Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and found a single table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season in the TabFact database.
- Inspected the table schema.
- Queried the table to identify whether any games were against the New York Yankees and to understand opponent labeling and coverage.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16)
- Table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season

Schema (from tool)
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
- No keys, constraints, or relationships.

Evidence
1) Distinct opponents present in the table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY opponent ASC;
Result:
- astros
- cardinals
- cubs
- diamondbacks
- padres
- pirates
- reds

2) Check for any Yankees entries by name or common variants
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS yankee_count FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yankee%';
Result: yankee_count = 0

SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yankee%' ORDER BY date;
Result: no rows returned

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yank%';
Result: cnt = 0

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%nyy%';
Result: cnt = 0

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%new york%';
Result: cnt = 0

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yank%' OR opponent ILIKE '%nyy%' OR opponent ILIKE '%new york%' ORDER BY opponent;
Result: no rows returned

3) Coverage check: total games and opponent breakdown
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: total_games = 27

SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season GROUP BY opponent ORDER BY opponent ASC;
Result:
- astros: 6
- cardinals: 3
- cubs: 3
- diamondbacks: 3
- padres: 4
- pirates: 1
- reds: 7

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset labeled as the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season (27 games recorded), there are zero games against the New York Yankees. Therefore, the claim that the Brewers played the Yankees only two times is contradicted by the data in this source.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The only accessible table contains 27 games and lists opponents by nickname (e.g., astros, cubs). No entries match Yankees or common variants (yankees, nyy, new york). The conclusion is based strictly on this dataset’s coverage.
