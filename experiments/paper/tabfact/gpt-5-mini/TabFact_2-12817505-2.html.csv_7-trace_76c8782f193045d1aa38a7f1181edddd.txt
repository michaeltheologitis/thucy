Data source discovery
- Using the available tools, I discovered one accessible relational dataset: a PostgreSQL TabFact database with a single table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season. This table contains Manchester United’s 2005–06 season matches, including date, opponent, home/away, result, attendance, and league position.

Step 1: Determine the attendance for the Arsenal match on 9 April 2006
Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Locate all Arsenal fixtures in the table
SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Arsenal%';
Result rows:
- {date: "3 january 2006", opponents: "arsenal", h / a: "a", result f - a: "0 - 0", attendance: 38313}
- {date: "9 april 2006", opponents: "arsenal", h / a: "h", result f - a: "2 - 0", attendance: 70908}

2) Confirm the specific 9 April 2006 row
SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE date = '9 april 2006' AND opponents = 'arsenal';
Result row:
- {date: "9 april 2006", opponents: "arsenal", h / a: "h", result f - a: "2 - 0", attendance: 70908}
Conclusion: The attendance to match exactly is 70908.

Step 2: Count how many matches on or after 13 August 2005 have attendance exactly equal to 70908
Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) List matching matches and their dates/opponents
SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, attendance, to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') AS dt
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE attendance = 70908
  AND to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005','FMDD FMMonth YYYY')
ORDER BY dt;
Result rows:
- date: 9 april 2006, opponents: arsenal, attendance: 70908, dt: 2006-04-09

2) Count those matches
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE attendance = 70908
  AND to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005','FMDD FMMonth YYYY');
Result:
- match_count: 1

Findings
- Within the available dataset (Manchester United 2005–06 season), there is exactly 1 match on or after 13 August 2005 with attendance equal to the Arsenal match on 9 April 2006 (70908). This directly contradicts the claim of 19 games.

Assumptions made for verification
- “Since 13 August 2005” is interpreted as on or after 2005-08-13, inclusive.
- The claim is evaluated against the accessible dataset (public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season), which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
- Date strings are parsed using to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY').
