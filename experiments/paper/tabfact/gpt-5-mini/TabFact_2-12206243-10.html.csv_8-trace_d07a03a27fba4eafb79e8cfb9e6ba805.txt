Summary
- Claim: “Mike Mussina get the win in the September 25 game against the Oriole.”
- Finding: In the only accessible relevant dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays season), the September 25 game vs. Orioles lists “loss: mussina (15 - 8)” and the Blue Jays’ record improves from 72-86 to 73-86 that day, indicating Toronto won and Mussina was the losing pitcher, not the winner.

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact20 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate September entries and identify September 25 row
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Sep%' OR date ILIKE '%September%';
Key returned row among the September results:
- date: september 25; opponent: orioles; score: 4 - 3; loss: mussina (15 - 8); attendance: 28324; record: 73 - 86

2) Filter specifically for September 25
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE (date ILIKE '%Sep%' OR date ILIKE '%September%') AND date ILIKE '%25%';
Returned row:
- date: september 25; opponent: orioles; score: 4 - 3; loss: mussina (15 - 8); attendance: 28324; record: 73 - 86

3) Confirm record progression from Sept 24 to Sept 25
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE 'September 24%'
   OR date ILIKE 'September 25%'
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- september 24 | opponent: orioles | score: 9 - 3 | loss: daal (1 - 1) | attendance: 27443 | record: 72 - 86
- september 25 | opponent: orioles | score: 4 - 3 | loss: mussina (15 - 8) | attendance: 28324 | record: 73 - 86
Interpretation: The team record improved from 72-86 to 73-86, meaning Toronto won on Sept 25. The losing pitcher listed is Mussina, so he did not earn the win.

Conclusion
- The data shows that on September 25 (1997), vs. the Orioles, Mike Mussina was the losing pitcher. Therefore, the claim that he “got the win” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the September 25 game in the available dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays season). No other seasons or teams were accessible in the connected data.
- The “loss” column denotes the game’s losing pitcher (from either team), consistent across the table and corroborated by record changes.
