Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate call sign and frequency data.
- Queried the table containing call signs and their frequencies to retrieve records for W269AX and W273AE.

Data source discovery
- One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema was available.
- Relevant table: public.wyfk, with columns including "call sign" (text) and "frequency mhz" (text).

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w269ax','w273ae');

- Results:
  - call sign: w269ax, frequency mhz: 101.7 fm
  - call sign: w273ae, frequency mhz: 102.5 fm

Assessment
- The data shows that:
  - W269AX has frequency 101.7 fm.
  - W273AE has frequency 102.5 fm.
- This matches the claim exactly.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the database evidence.

Assumptions
- Matches on call signs were performed case-insensitively (e.g., "W269AX" ≈ "w269ax").
- "frequency mhz" values are treated as the authoritative FM broadcast frequencies for the listed call signs.
