Summary
- Claim: “netherlands and romania have game on june 1 and june 3, respectively, in 1998.”
- Finding: Verified by an authoritative table of Paraguay’s 1998 fixtures, which shows matches played in the Netherlands on 1998-06-01 and in Romania on 1998-06-03. These entries indicate the respective national teams had games on those dates (friendlies vs Paraguay).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16)
- Discovered table: public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football (columns: date, venue, score, comp, report)

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Full table scan to inspect 1998 fixtures and dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football ORDER BY date ASC;

Returned rows (relevant excerpts):
- date: 1998 - 06 - 01 | venue: philips stadion eindhoven , netherlands | score: 5 - 1 | comp: f | report: 457
- date: 1998 - 06 - 03 | venue: steaua stadium bucharest , romania | score: 3 - 2 | comp: f | report: 458

2) Focused filter on the two dates in question
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date IN ('1998 - 06 - 01','1998 - 06 - 03') ORDER BY date;

Returned rows:
- date: 1998 - 06 - 01 | venue: philips stadion eindhoven , netherlands | score: 5 - 1 | comp: f | report: 457
- date: 1998 - 06 - 03 | venue: steaua stadium bucharest , romania | score: 3 - 2 | comp: f | report: 458

Interpretation
- The entries clearly show matches took place in the Netherlands on June 1, 1998, and in Romania on June 3, 1998. Given the table is Paraguay’s 1998 fixtures, these are international friendlies (comp = 'f') against Paraguay, implying that the Netherlands and Romania national teams indeed had games on those respective dates.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Have game” refers to international football (soccer) matches.
- Venue listed as being in the Netherlands (Eindhoven) and Romania (Bucharest) implies the respective national teams hosted/played those matches on the stated dates (vs Paraguay), which suffices to confirm they had games on those dates.
