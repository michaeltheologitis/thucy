Data sources explored
- Discovered one PostgreSQL data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact27), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.fabio_fognini with columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, score in the final.

Goal
Verify the claim: “29 april 2012 have an outcome of winner, where tommy robredo be the opponent in the final.”

Evidence from the data
1) Check that the date exists in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.fabio_fognini LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt includes:
- "29 april 2012"

2) Retrieve the record for that date
Executed SQL:
SELECT outcome, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", "score in the final" 
FROM public.fabio_fognini
WHERE date = '29 april 2012';
Results:
- outcome: runner - up
- tournament: brd năstase ţiriac trophy , bucharest , romania
- surface: clay
- opponent in the final: gilles simon
- score in the final: 4 - 6 , 3 - 6

Assessment
- The table records that on 29 april 2012 the outcome was “runner - up,” not “winner.”
- The opponent in the final on that date was “gilles simon,” not “tommy robredo.”

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data in public.fabio_fognini.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the entry in the public.fabio_fognini table for the date text exactly matching “29 april 2012.”
- “Opponent in the final” is interpreted as the opponent listed in the “opponent in the final” column for that date.
