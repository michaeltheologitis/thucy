Data source discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table: public.dragons_den_uk
  - Columns: episode (text), first aired (text), entrepreneur (s) (text), company or product name (text), money requested (bigint), investing dragon (s) (text)

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL and results):
1) Verify how episodes are labeled
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT episode FROM public.dragons_den_uk ORDER BY episode LIMIT 100;
Result:
- episode 1
- episode 2
- episode 3
- episode 4
- episode 5
- episode 6
- episode 7
- episode 8
- episode 9

2) List entrepreneur(s) and money requested for episode 7
SQL:
SELECT "entrepreneur (s)" AS entrepreneur, "money requested" FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE episode = 'episode 7';
Results:
- entrepreneur: sammy french | money requested: 100000
- entrepreneur: jerry mantalvanos & paul merker | money requested: 100000

3) Compute the maximum money requested in episode 7
SQL:
SELECT MAX("money requested") AS max_money_requested FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE episode = 'episode 7';
Result:
- max_money_requested: 100000

4) Check all appearances of Jerry Mantalvanos or Paul Merker across the dataset
SQL:
SELECT episode, "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested"
FROM public.dragons_den_uk
WHERE "entrepreneur (s)" ILIKE '%jerry mantalvanos%'
   OR "entrepreneur (s)" ILIKE '%paul merker%';
Result:
- episode: episode 7 | entrepreneur (s): jerry mantalvanos & paul merker | money requested: 100000

5) Check whether any row has money requested = 145000
SQL:
SELECT episode, "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested" FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE "money requested" = 145000;
Result:
- episode: episode 6 | entrepreneur (s): ian helmore | money requested: 145000

Findings:
- In episode 7, the highest money requested is 100000, and the entry for "jerry mantalvanos & paul merker" is 100000—not 145000.
- An amount of 145000 does appear in the dataset, but it is in episode 6 by Ian Helmore, not episode 7 and not by Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker.

Conclusion: The claim that in episode 7, 145000 is the highest amount requested by Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Episode 7" refers to rows where episode = 'episode 7' as stored in the table (verified above).
- The dataset represents Dragons' Den UK episodes; currency is not specified but amounts are compared as raw numeric values.
