Claim: “Season 3 of Dexter began airing after October 2008.”

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table relevant to the claim: public.dexter_season_3.

Evidence from the database (with executed SQL):
1) Inspect date formats present
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "original air date" FROM public.dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "original air date" ASC;
Result (distinct values):
- december 7 , 2008
- november 16 , 2008
- november 2 , 2008
- november 30 , 2008
- november 9 , 2008
- october 12 , 2008
- october 19 , 2008
- october 26 , 2008
- october 5 , 2008
- september 28 , 2008

2) Parse and order dates chronologically
SQL: SELECT "original air date" AS original,
       to_date(
         regexp_replace(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ', 'g')), '\\s+', ' ', 'g'),
         'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY'
       ) AS parsed_date
FROM public.dexter_season_3
ORDER BY parsed_date;
Result (original -> parsed_date):
- september 28 , 2008 -> 2008-09-28
- october 5 , 2008   -> 2008-10-05
- october 12 , 2008  -> 2008-10-12
- october 19 , 2008  -> 2008-10-19
- october 26 , 2008  -> 2008-10-26
- november 2 , 2008  -> 2008-11-02
- november 9 , 2008  -> 2008-11-09
- november 16 , 2008 -> 2008-11-16
- november 30 , 2008 -> 2008-11-30
- december 7 , 2008  -> 2008-12-07

3) Compute the earliest air date (premiere)
SQL: SELECT MIN(
         to_date(
           regexp_replace(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ', 'g')), '\\s+', ' ', 'g'),
           'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY'
         )
       ) AS earliest_air_date
FROM public.dexter_season_3;
Result: earliest_air_date = 2008-09-28

Analysis:
- The earliest original air date for Season 3 is 2008-09-28, which is before October 2008. Therefore, the season did not begin airing after October 2008.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “begin air after October 2008” as the season premiere date being later than October 2008 (i.e., after 2008-10-31). Even if interpreted as after October 1, 2008, the premiere on 2008-09-28 is still before October, so the claim remains false.
