Claim interpreted: “The Agricultural Panel has the most members from one party.” I interpret this as comparing, across all panels in the available dataset, the maximum number of members any single party holds in each panel, and checking whether the Agricultural Panel’s maximum is the highest.

Data sources discovered
- TabFact database (public schema). Relevant table: public.members_of_the_5th_seanad.

Schema details (from tool):
- Table public.members_of_the_5th_seanad with columns: party; administrative panel; agricultural panel; cultural and educational panel; industrial and commercial panel; labour panel; national university of ireland; university of dublin; nominated by the taoiseach; total.

Evidence 1: Inspect raw counts by party and panel
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad;

Result (rows):
1) fianna fáil | 4 | 4 | 2 | 3 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 7 | 21
2) fine gael   | 1 | 3 | 2 | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 9
3) labour party| 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 5 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 8
4) clann na talmhan | 0 | 2 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 3
5) independent | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 3 | 3 | 9
6) total       | 7 |11 | 5 | 9 |11 | 3 | 3 |11 |60

Evidence 2: For each panel, find the maximum members held by any single party (excluding the ‘total’ row), and which party/parties achieve it
Executed SQL:
WITH unpivot AS (
  SELECT party, 'administrative panel' AS panel, "administrative panel" AS cnt FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'agricultural panel', "agricultural panel" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'cultural and educational panel', "cultural and educational panel" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'industrial and commercial panel', "industrial and commercial panel" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'labour panel', "labour panel" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'national university of ireland', "national university of ireland" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'university of dublin', "university of dublin" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
  UNION ALL SELECT party, 'nominated by the taoiseach', "nominated by the taoiseach" FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
)
, filtered AS (
  SELECT * FROM unpivot WHERE party <> 'total'
)
, maxes AS (
  SELECT panel, MAX(cnt) AS max_count FROM filtered GROUP BY panel
)
SELECT m.panel AS panel_name, m.max_count, string_agg(f.party, ', ' ORDER BY f.party) AS parties
FROM maxes m
JOIN filtered f ON f.panel = m.panel AND f.cnt = m.max_count
GROUP BY m.panel, m.max_count
ORDER BY m.max_count DESC, m.panel;

Results:
- nominated by the taoiseach — max_count: 7 — parties: fianna fáil
- labour panel — max_count: 5 — parties: labour party
- administrative panel — max_count: 4 — parties: fianna fáil
- agricultural panel — max_count: 4 — parties: fianna fáil
- industrial and commercial panel — max_count: 3 — parties: fianna fáil
- university of dublin — max_count: 3 — parties: independent
- cultural and educational panel — max_count: 2 — parties: fianna fáil, fine gael
- national university of ireland — max_count: 1 — parties: fianna fáil, fine gael, independent

Findings
- The Agricultural Panel’s highest single-party count is 4 (Fianna Fáil).
- Other panels have higher maxima: “Nominated by the Taoiseach” has 7 (Fianna Fáil), and the Labour Panel has 5 (Labour Party).
- Therefore, the Agricultural Panel does not have the most members from one party when compared across panels in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data in public.members_of_the_5th_seanad. The panel with the most members from a single party is “Nominated by the Taoiseach” (7 for Fianna Fáil), not the Agricultural Panel (4 for Fianna Fáil).

Assumptions
- I interpret “most member from 1 party” as the largest number of members attributed to a single party within a panel, compared across panels.
- Verification is based on the available table for the 5th Seanad in the TabFact public schema; no other Seanad sessions or datasets were available via the connected data sources.
