Summary
- Data source discovery found one database: TabFact, with one table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships.
- I interpret “the gap between first and last” as the difference in points between the first-place skater (minimum rank) and the last-place skater (maximum rank) in this table.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify first place (lowest rank)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MIN(rank) FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships);
Result:
- name = mark cockerell, rank = 1, points = 172.42

2) Identify last place (highest rank)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships);
Result:
- name = marc franquet, rank = 19, points = 114.38

3) Compute the points gap between first and last
SQL executed:
SELECT first.points - last.points AS gap_points, abs(first.points - last.points) AS abs_gap FROM (SELECT points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MIN(rank) FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships)) AS first, (SELECT points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships)) AS last;
Result:
- gap_points = 58.03999999999999 (≈ 58.04)
- abs_gap = 58.03999999999999 (≈ 58.04)

Conclusion
- The difference in points between the first-place and last-place competitors is 58.04 (rounded to two decimals). This supports the claim that “the gap between first and last be a total of 58.04.”

Assumptions
- “First” means the competitor with rank = 1 and “last” means the competitor with the maximum rank in the table (rank = 19).
- “Gap” refers to the difference in the points column, and rounding to two decimals is acceptable.
