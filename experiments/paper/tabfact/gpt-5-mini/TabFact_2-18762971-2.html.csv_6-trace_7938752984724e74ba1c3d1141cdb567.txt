Scope and data source
- Verified against the connected PostgreSQL database (TabFact), table: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season. Columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the maximum attendance recorded in the season
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season;
Result:
[{"max_attendance":38433}]

2) Retrieve the match(es) with that maximum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE attendance = 38433;
Result:
[{"attendance":38433, "date":"1 april 2001", "opponent":"sheffield united", "result":"1 - 2", "venue":"h"}]

3) Check whether any highest-attendance match opponent is Birmingham City
SQL executed:
SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE attendance = 38433 AND LOWER(opponent) = 'birmingham city') AS includes_birmingham;
Result:
[{"includes_birmingham":false}]

Conclusion
- The match with the highest attendance (38,433) was against Sheffield United, not Birmingham City. Therefore, the claim that the highest-attendance match was against Birmingham City is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available dataset: Sheffield Wednesday FC 2000–01 season.
- Opponent name checks were performed case-insensitively (using LOWER).
