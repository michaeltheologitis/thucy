Assessment
- The dataset contains a game against Louisville with the date listed as “november 14,” and the site listed as “dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc,” which directly matches the claim that Louisville played at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC on November 14.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

- “Louisville” refers to the University of Louisville football team.
- The date field in the table does not include a year; the table name suggests the 1990–1999 period. Verification is limited to that scope but directly confirms the stated date and venue.
- Minor formatting differences in the site name (spaces around the hyphen) are treated as equivalent to “Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium, Greenville, NC.”
