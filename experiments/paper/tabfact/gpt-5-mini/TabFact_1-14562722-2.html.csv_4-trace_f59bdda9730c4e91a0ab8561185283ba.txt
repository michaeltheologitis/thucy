Claim to verify: "on march 15 , 2007 and in region 4 , the highest number of episode be 4"

Data source discovery and schema overview
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text). No date-typed columns are present; region fields are text.

Step 1: Understand available values and overall maxima
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: total_rows = 5

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS region4_nonnull_nonempty FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" IS NOT NULL AND trim("region 4") <> '';
Result: region4_nonnull_nonempty = 5

SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(episodes) AS min_episodes, MAX(episodes) AS max_episodes FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: min_episodes = 4, max_episodes = 4

SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(episodes) AS min_episodes_region4, MAX(episodes) AS max_episodes_region4 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" IS NOT NULL AND trim("region 4") <> '';
Result: min_episodes_region4 = 4, max_episodes_region4 = 4

SQL executed:
SELECT episodes, "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY episodes DESC NULLS LAST LIMIT 10;
Result rows:
(4, "march 15 , 2007")
(4, "july 5 , 2007")
(4, "march 13 , 2008")
(4, "june 19 , 2008")
(4, "march 5 , 2009")

Interpretation so far: Across all rows (including those with a Region 4 value), the maximum episodes count is 4. Region 4 column contains date-like text values including "march 15 , 2007".

Step 2: Directly test the specific date within Region 4
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_matching FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007';
Result: count_matching = 1

SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT episodes FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007' ORDER BY episodes;
Result: episodes = [4]

SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(episodes) AS max_episodes FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007';
Result: max_episodes = 4

Conclusion
- There is a row where Region 4 equals "march 15 , 2007".
- For that row (and across the dataset), the highest number of episodes is 4.
- Therefore, the claim that on "march 15 , 2007" in Region 4 the highest number of episodes is 4 is supported by the data.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted "episode" as the numeric column episodes in public.my_info_table.
- Interpreted "on march 15 , 2007 and in region 4" as referring to rows where the text column "region 4" exactly equals 'march 15 , 2007'.
- The dataset has no explicit date-typed columns; Region 4 holds date-like text values, and exact string matching was used.
