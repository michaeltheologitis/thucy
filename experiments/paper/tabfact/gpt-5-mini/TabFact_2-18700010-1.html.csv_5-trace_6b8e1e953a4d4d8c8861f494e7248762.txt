Claim interpreted: “Dave Sutton has the least league goals among players in the DF (defender) position.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25), schema public.
- Relevant table: t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season with columns: name (text), position (text), league apps (text), league goals (bigint), fa cup apps (bigint), fa cup goals (bigint), league cup apps (text), league cup goals (bigint), total apps (text), total goals (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify Dave Sutton’s record (position and league goals)
SQL:
SELECT name, position, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE 'Dave Sutton' OR name ILIKE '%Dave Sutton%';
Result:
[{"league goals":6,"name":"dave sutton","position":"df"}]
Finding: Dave Sutton is listed as a defender (df) with 6 league goals.

2) List all defenders (DF) and their league goals
SQL:
SELECT name, position, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%df%' ORDER BY "league goals" ASC NULLS LAST, name;
Result:
[{"league goals":0,"name":"bernard purdie","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":0,"name":"chris topping","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":0,"name":"jim branagan","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":1,"name":"fred robinson","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":2,"name":"keith hanvey","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":2,"name":"malcolm brown","position":"df"},
 {"league goals":6,"name":"dave sutton","position":"df"}]
Finding: Defenders’ league goals are 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, and 6.

3) Compute the minimum league goals among defenders
SQL:
SELECT MIN("league goals") AS min_league_goals FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%df%';
Result:
[{"min_league_goals":0}]
Finding: The least league goals among defenders is 0.

4) Check how many defenders have the minimum and whether Dave Sutton matches the minimum
SQL (count defenders with min = 0):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS defenders_with_min FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%df%' AND "league goals" = 0;
Result:
[{"defenders_with_min":3}]

SQL (does Dave Sutton have the defenders’ minimum?):
SELECT name, "league goals" AS dave_league_goals, ("league goals" = (SELECT MIN("league goals") FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%df%')) AS is_min_among_dfs FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE 'dave sutton' OR name ILIKE '%Dave Sutton%';
Result:
[{"dave_league_goals":6,"is_min_among_dfs":false,"name":"dave sutton"}]
Finding: Three defenders have the minimum (0) and Dave Sutton, with 6 league goals, does not have the minimum.

Conclusion
- The claim that Dave Sutton has the least league goals among DF players is contradicted by the data. Dave Sutton has 6 league goals, while the minimum among defenders is 0 (held by three players: bernard purdie, chris topping, jim branagan).

Assumptions
- “DF position” was interpreted as any row where position contains “df” (case-insensitive). The claim was interpreted as asserting that Dave Sutton has the least league goals among defenders in this table (Huddersfield Town F.C. 1979–80 season).
