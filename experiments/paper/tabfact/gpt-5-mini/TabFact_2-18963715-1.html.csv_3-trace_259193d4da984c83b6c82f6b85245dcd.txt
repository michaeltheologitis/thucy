Conclusion: The data shows that 2009 is the only year in which Reasons to Be Pretty had nominations at the Drama Desk Awards.

Evidence:
1) Distinct years with Drama Desk entries for Reasons to Be Pretty
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM reasons_to_be_pretty WHERE "award ceremony" ILIKE '%drama desk%' ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  - 2009

2) Detailed Drama Desk entries for those years
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, "category", nominee, result FROM reasons_to_be_pretty WHERE "award ceremony" ILIKE '%drama desk%' AND year IN (2009) ORDER BY year, "category";
- Result rows:
  - year: 2009 | category: outstanding actor in a play | nominee: thomas sadoski | result: nominated
  - year: 2009 | category: outstanding director of a play | nominee: terry kinney | result: nominated
  - year: 2009 | category: outstanding play | nominee: outstanding play | result: nominated

3) Cross-check of available award ceremonies and Drama Desk counts by year
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "award ceremony" FROM public.reasons_to_be_pretty ORDER BY "award ceremony";
- Result:
  - drama desk award
  - theatre world award
  - tony award

- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS drama_desk_count FROM public.reasons_to_be_pretty WHERE lower("award ceremony") LIKE '%drama desk%' GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  - year: 2009 | drama_desk_count: 3

Interpretation and assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as asking whether 2009 was the only year that Reasons to Be Pretty had a nominee at the Drama Desk Awards. The table contains a dedicated record set for this play’s awards and indicates Drama Desk entries only in 2009. Matching for the ceremony name was done case-insensitively (values appear as 'drama desk award').
