Claim interpreted: In the 2006 season, there were exactly two different games whose final score was 7 - 2.

Data source used: TabFact PostgreSQL instance, table public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season (game-by-game results for the 2006 Texas Rangers season).

Evidence
1) Count of games with score exactly '7 - 2'
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '7 - 2';
Result:
cnt = 2

2) Dates and opponents for games with score exactly '7 - 2'
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '7 - 2' ORDER BY date;
Results:
- date: september 1, opponent: indians
- date: september 8, opponent: mariners

3) Robustness check (ignoring spaces in the score field)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE REPLACE(score, ' ', '') = '7-2';
Result:
count = 2

SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE REPLACE(score, ' ', '') = '7-2';
Results (key fields):
- september 1 | indians  | score: 7 - 2 | record: 69 - 67
- september 8 | mariners | score: 7 - 2 | record: 72 - 70

Conclusion
The data shows exactly two games in the 2006 Texas Rangers season with a final score of 7 - 2. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- "2006 season" refers to the 2006 Texas Rangers season, as that is the available dataset.
- "Final game score be 7 - 2" is interpreted as the score string in the score column matching 7 - 2 (we verified both exact formatting and a spaces-ignored variant).
