Assessment
- The accessible 1998 football data records four World Cup matches, all in June 1998 and all in France.
- There are zero World Cup matches in July 1998 in this data, and zero World Cup matches in Japan.
- Therefore, the claim that there were three World Cup games throughout July 1998, all in Japan, is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “World Cup” refers to the 1998 FIFA World Cup. The available table (1998 in Paraguayan football) is treated as authoritative within its scope and shows the dates/venues of the relevant World Cup matches logged there.
