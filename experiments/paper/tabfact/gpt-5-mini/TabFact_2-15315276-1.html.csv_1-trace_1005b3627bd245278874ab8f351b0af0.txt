Scope and data discovery:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL instance "TabFact" with one relevant table: public.northeast_delta_dental_international.
- Table schema (key fields): year (bigint), champion (text), country (text), among others. "country" represents the winner’s nationality.

Evidence:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, champion, country FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year = 2012;
- Result:
  year: 2012; champion: jenny gleason; country: united states

Analysis:
- For the year 2012, the table records the champion as Jenny Gleason with country listed as "united states". This directly supports the claim that in 2012 the champion was from the United States.

Conclusion:
- The data confirms the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the champion recorded in the only available relevant dataset (the Northeast Delta Dental International event) and interprets "united state" as the United States of America.
