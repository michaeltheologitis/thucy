Claim interpreted: For the 1997 Oakland Raiders, the Week 11 opponent was the New Orleans Saints (and this was the first time they faced the Saints that season).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, "tv time", attendance)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full schedule by week to locate Week 11 opponent
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season ORDER BY week;
Key rows observed:
- 11 | november 9 , 1997 | new orleans saints | l 13 - 10

2) Direct check for Week 11 row
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week = 11;
Result:
- 11 | november 9 , 1997 | new orleans saints | l 13 - 10

3) Verify it was the first (and only) game vs the Saints that season
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Saints%' ORDER BY week;
Result:
- week: 11 | date: november 9 , 1997 | opponent: new orleans saints | result: l 13 - 10

SQL:
SELECT MIN(week) AS min_week FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Saints%';
Result:
- min_week: 11

Findings
- The Week 11 opponent for the 1997 Oakland Raiders was the New Orleans Saints, and this was the first (and only) meeting with the Saints that season.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1997 Oakland Raiders schedule contained in public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season.
- The phrase "for the first time" is taken to mean the first meeting with the Saints during that season, as no earlier weeks list the Saints as the opponent.
