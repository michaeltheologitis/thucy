Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that “the Cubs [were/beat] the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers’ season opponent 4 times.” I verify both readings: (a) number of games vs Cubs, and (b) number of Brewers losses vs Cubs (i.e., games the Cubs beat the Brewers).

Data source discovery
- Available DB: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13)
- Public schema tables: one relevant table found — t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Schema-based evidence of opponents and counts
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY games DESC, opponent;

Result excerpt (opponent → number of games):
- reds: 7
- astros: 6
- padres: 4
- cardinals: 3
- cubs: 3
- diamondbacks: 3
- pirates: 1

Targeted check for “Cubs” labeling
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Cubs%'
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY games DESC, opponent;

Result:
- opponent: cubs — games: 3

Direct listing of Brewers vs. Cubs games
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE opponent = 'cubs'
ORDER BY date;

Returned rows:
- september 20 | cubs | 5 - 3 | williams (5 - 9)
- september 21 | cubs | 7 - 6 | van buren (0 - 2)
- september 22 | cubs | 0 - 3 | helling (2 - 1)

If the claim meant “Cubs beat the Brewers 4 times” (loss count)
SQL executed (compare runs in score to infer losses; score format is 'Brewers - Opponent'):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games,
  SUM(CASE WHEN (split_part(score,' - ',1))::int < (split_part(score,' - ',2))::int THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS brewer_losses
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE opponent = 'cubs';

Result:
- total_games = 3
- brewer_losses = 1 (i.e., Cubs beat Brewers once in the listed games)

Conclusion
- Number of Brewers games vs. Cubs in this dataset: 3 (not 4).
- Number of Brewers losses vs. Cubs (Cubs wins) in this dataset: 1 (not 4).
Therefore, the claim that it happened 4 times is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be” as either “were” (opponent count) or “beat” (loss count). I verified both.
- The table t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season is the only authoritative source available; conclusions are drawn strictly from its contents.
- The score field is interpreted as Milwaukee runs first, opponent runs second. The “loss” column contains losing pitcher details, not a boolean flag.
