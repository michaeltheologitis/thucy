  - series (bigint)
  - season (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - directed by (text)
  - written by (text)
  - original air date (text)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify whether the episode with overall “series number” 54 exists and who wrote it.

SELECT title, season, series, "written by" FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes WHERE series = 54;

- title: the queen 's gambit job
- season: 10
- series: 54
- written by: m scott veach & rebecca kirsch
