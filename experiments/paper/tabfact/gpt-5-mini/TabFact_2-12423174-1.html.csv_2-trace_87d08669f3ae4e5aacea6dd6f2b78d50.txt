Data environment explored:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs with columns ["team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg"].

Evidence gathered:
1) Query to find any ties involving Enugu Rangers or Secteur 6
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg"
FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Enugu%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Enugu%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Rangers%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Rangers%'
   OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Secteur%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Secteur%';

Result:
- team 1: secteur 6; agg: 1 - 2; team 2: enugu rangers; 1st leg: 1 - 1; 2nd leg: 0 - 1

Interpretation of evidence:
- The aggregate score is 1–2 in favor of Enugu Rangers, meaning Secteur 6 lost the tie by 1 goal overall.
- Additionally, the second leg result (0–1) shows Secteur 6 lost that specific match by 1 goal as well.

Conclusion:
- The claim that "Secteur 6 lose by 1 against Enugu Rangers" is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "lose by 1" as either (a) losing the two-leg tie by a single goal on aggregate or (b) losing a leg by one goal; both are true based on the data above.
- Interpreted "enugu ranger" as the Nigerian club Enugu Rangers.
