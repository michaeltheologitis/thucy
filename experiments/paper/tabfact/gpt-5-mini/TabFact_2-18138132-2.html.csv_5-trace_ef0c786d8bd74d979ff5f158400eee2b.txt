Summary
- I verified the claim against the available TabFact PostgreSQL database, specifically the public.list_of_zune_applications table that catalogs Zune applications with columns: title, developer, category, release date, version.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: TabFact (public schema) with table public.list_of_zune_applications (title text, developer text, category text, "release date" text, version text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find any app titled “facebook” and check its developer and release date
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, "release date", version
FROM list_of_zune_applications
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%facebook%'
ORDER BY title;
Result:
- title: facebook; developer: matchbox; release date: 2010 - 12 - 16; version: 1.4
Interpretation: The app titled “facebook” exists with release date 2010 - 12 - 16, but its developer is “matchbox,” not “babaroga.”

2) Check explicitly if any row has title 'facebook' and developer 'babaroga'
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM list_of_zune_applications WHERE lower(title) = 'facebook' AND lower(developer) = 'babaroga';
Result: match_count = 0
Executed SQL (row retrieval):
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version FROM list_of_zune_applications WHERE lower(title) = 'facebook' AND lower(developer) = 'babaroga';
Result: no rows
Interpretation: No app matches both title 'facebook' and developer 'babaroga'.

3) What apps (if any) are by developer 'babaroga'?
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "release date" FROM list_of_zune_applications WHERE trim(lower(developer)) = 'babaroga';
Result:
- title: fingerpaint; release date: 2011 - 07 - 29
Interpretation: 'babaroga' appears as a developer in the dataset, but not for the 'facebook' app.

Conclusion
- Title: “facebook” — supported by data.
- Release date: 2010 - 12 - 16 — supported by data.
- Developer: “babaroga” — contradicted by data (developer is “matchbox”).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to entries in the TabFact public.list_of_zune_applications dataset.
- Case-insensitive matching was used for string comparisons and exact title equality where noted.
- The "release date" column is stored as text; comparisons are based on exact textual content as stored.
