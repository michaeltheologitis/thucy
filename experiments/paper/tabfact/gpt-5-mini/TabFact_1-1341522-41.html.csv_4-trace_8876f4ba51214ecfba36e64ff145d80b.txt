Claim interpreted: “There are 2 Republican incumbents that were first elected in 1974.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: postgres_tabfact7, table public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994.
- Table columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), status (text), opponent (text).

Evidence from the data
1) Inspect party values
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT party FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 ORDER BY party;
- Result:
  [ {"party":"democratic"}, {"party":"republican"} ]

2) Count Republican incumbents with first elected year 1974
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE party ILIKE 'republican' AND "first elected" = 1974;
- Result:
  [ {"count": 1} ]

3) List the names and districts of those Republican incumbents first elected in 1974
- SQL executed:
  SELECT incumbent, district FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE party ILIKE 'republican' AND "first elected" = 1974 ORDER BY incumbent;
- Result:
  [ {"district":"pennsylvania19", "incumbent":"william f goodling"} ]

4) List all incumbents first elected in 1974 (to see party distribution)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT incumbent, party, district FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE "first elected" = 1974 ORDER BY incumbent;
- Result:
  [
    {"incumbent":"john murtha", "party":"democratic", "district":"pennsylvania12"},
    {"incumbent":"william f goodling", "party":"republican", "district":"pennsylvania19"}
  ]

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly one Republican incumbent first elected in 1974 (William F. Goodling). There are two incumbents in total first elected in 1974, but only one is Republican. Therefore, the claim that there are two Republican incumbents first elected in 1974 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Republican” party is matched case-insensitively to the literal value 'republican' found in the table.
- “First elected” refers to the integer year stored in the "first elected" column and matches exactly 1974.
- The table represents incumbents in the context of the 1994 U.S. House elections (as suggested by column names and table title).
