Claim to verify: "none of the viral disease have a spherical virion shape"

Summary conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. The available viral_disease table contains at least one entry whose virion shape is explicitly recorded as "spherical".

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: One accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact instance) with a public schema.

Step 2: Inspect schema for relevant tables/fields
- Tool: Schema query
- Result:
  - Table: public.viral_disease
    - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Step 3: Check the distribution of virion shapes
- Objective: Determine if any records are labeled with a spherical virion shape.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  GROUP BY "virion shape"
  ORDER BY count DESC, "virion shape";
- Results:
  - icosahedral -> 13
  - helical -> 6
  - complex -> 2
  - helical , bullet shaped -> 1
  - spherical -> 1
- Interpretation: At least one record has virion shape recorded as "spherical".

Step 4: Retrieve the row(s) labeled as spherical for confirmation
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'spherical';
- Result (1 row):
  - family: unassigned
  - baltimore group: group v
  - envelopment: enveloped
  - virion shape: spherical
  - replication site: nucleus
- Interpretation: The table explicitly includes an entry with spherical virion morphology.

Step 5: Case-insensitive substring check for additional spherical labels
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" IS NOT NULL
    AND lower("virion shape") LIKE '%spher%'
  GROUP BY "virion shape"
  ORDER BY row_count DESC, "virion shape";
- Result:
  - spherical — 1 row
- Interpretation: The only spherical-related label present is exactly "spherical" (1 record), which suffices to refute the claim that none are spherical.

Overall analysis:
- The claim asserts that no viral diseases have spherical virion shapes. The data shows at least one entry categorized as spherical, directly contradicting the claim.

Answer: The claim is inaccurate based on the data above.

Assumptions made:
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the records in the available viral_disease dataset and the general statement that among viruses causing disease, none have spherical virions. The dataset explicitly records one such instance as spherical, which is sufficient to falsify the universal claim.
