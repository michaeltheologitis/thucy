Claim to verify: “Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell are both from Northern Ireland.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL). Identified a relevant table: t_2006_u_s_open_golf with columns: place, player, country, score, to par.

Evidence collected
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Harrington%' OR player ILIKE '%McDowell%';

- Results:
  • player: pádraig harrington, country: ireland
  • player: graeme mcdowell, country: northern ireland

Assessment
- The data show Graeme McDowell is associated with “northern ireland,” while Pádraig Harrington is associated with “ireland.” Therefore, they are not both from Northern Ireland.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user’s intent as: “Are both Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell from Northern Ireland?”
- Interpreted the table’s “country” column as the player’s represented country/national affiliation at the event, which suffices to assess whether each is from/associated with Northern Ireland.
