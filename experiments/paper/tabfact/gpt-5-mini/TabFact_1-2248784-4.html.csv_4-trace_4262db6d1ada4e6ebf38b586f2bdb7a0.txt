Claim to verify: "iran 's 2011 gdp be 261.189"

Data sources explored:
- TabFact (postgres_tabfact18), public schema. Relevant table: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp, which includes a column named "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd".

Evidence gathered:
- The table contains a row for Iran and reports its 2011 GDP (PPP) in billions of USD.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd"
FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
WHERE country ILIKE '%iran%';

Result:
- country: iran
- 2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd: 930.236

Assessment:
- The available authoritative data shows Iran’s 2011 GDP (PPP) = 930.236 (billions of USD), not 261.189. The claim is therefore contradicted by the data source at hand.

Assumptions and scope:
- The dataset available provides GDP measured in PPP (billions of USD) for 2011. The claim did not specify the GDP measure (nominal vs. PPP). Verification was performed against the PPP figure because that is the only 2011 GDP metric available in the connected data source.
