Claim to verify: During the 1961 VFL season, the MCG venue recorded the highest crowd participation.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1961_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence 1: Highest single-game crowd and its venue
- Executed SQL 1:
  SELECT MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd FROM t_1961_vfl_season;
  Result: max_crowd = 49678
- Executed SQL 2:
  SELECT venue, date, "home team", "away team", crowd FROM t_1961_vfl_season WHERE crowd = 49678;
  Result: { venue: "mcg", date: "3 june 1961", home team: "melbourne", away team: "carlton", crowd: 49678 }
- Interpretation: The single match with the highest attendance (49,678) was held at the MCG.

Evidence 2: Top matches by crowd (to check for ties and confirm ranking)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "venue", "date", "home team", "away team", "crowd"
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  ORDER BY "crowd" DESC
  LIMIT 5;
- Results (top 5):
  1) mcg, 3 june 1961, melbourne vs carlton, 49678
  2) victoria park, 3 june 1961, collingwood vs essendon, 28290
  3) kardinia park, 3 june 1961, geelong vs footscray, 18683
  4) glenferrie oval, 3 june 1961, hawthorn vs richmond, 15000
  5) lake oval, 3 june 1961, south melbourne vs fitzroy, 14500
- Interpretation: The MCG match is clearly the highest-attended; no ties observed.

Evidence 3: Aggregate attendance by venue (to test an alternative reading: highest total attendance at a venue during the season)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT venue,
         COUNT(*) AS matches_hosted,
         SUM("crowd") AS total_crowd,
         MAX("crowd") AS max_single_game_crowd
  FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
  GROUP BY venue
  ORDER BY total_crowd DESC;
- Results (ordered by total_crowd):
  - mcg — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 49678, max_single_game_crowd: 49678
  - victoria park — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 28290, max_single_game_crowd: 28290
  - kardinia park — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 18683, max_single_game_crowd: 18683
  - glenferrie oval — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 15000, max_single_game_crowd: 15000
  - lake oval — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 14500, max_single_game_crowd: 14500
  - arden street oval — matches_hosted: 1, total_crowd: 13000, max_single_game_crowd: 13000
- Interpretation: By total crowd aggregated per venue, the MCG also ranks highest in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows that in the 1961 VFL season data, the MCG hosted the highest-attended match (49,678) and, by aggregation, had the highest total attendance among venues. The claim is supported.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “highest crowd participation” primarily as the highest single-game attendance; also validated the interpretation as highest total attendance by venue.
- Treated the table t_1961_vfl_season as the authoritative representation of the 1961 VFL season within the available data source.
