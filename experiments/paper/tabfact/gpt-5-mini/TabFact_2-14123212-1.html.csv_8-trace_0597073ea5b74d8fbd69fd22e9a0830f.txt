Summary:
- Claim: w293al and w264bf share the same ERP (column: erp w).
- Finding: They do not share the same ERP. w293al has ERP = 80 W; w264bf has ERP = 2 W.

Data source exploration:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: whlp
  - Columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (double precision), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve ERP values for the two call signs
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE LOWER("call sign") IN ('w293al','w264bf') ORDER BY "call sign";
Results:
- call sign: w264bf, erp w: 2
- call sign: w293al, erp w: 80

2) Direct equality check of ERP values
SQL executed:
SELECT (SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE LOWER("call sign")='w293al' LIMIT 1) AS erp_w293al, (SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE LOWER("call sign")='w264bf' LIMIT 1) AS erp_w264bf, ( (SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE LOWER("call sign")='w293al' LIMIT 1) = (SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE LOWER("call sign")='w264bf' LIMIT 1) ) AS erp_equal;
Results:
- erp_w293al: 80
- erp_w264bf: 2
- erp_equal: false

Conclusion:
- The data contradicts the claim. w293al and w264bf do not share the same ERP value.

Assumptions:
- Matching on call signs is case-insensitive using LOWER(call sign).
- The ERP compared is the whlp."erp w" column in watts.
