Claim interpreted: “No team is tied on points; but most [teams] are separated by more than 1 goal difference.” I verified this against the available standings-like table in the connected data source.

Data source discovery
- Tool used: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL source (TabFact Postgres). I then searched for standings tables.

Schema inspection
- Tool used: schema_query
- Relevant table found: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  - Columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text). I interpret “difference” as goal difference (GD). Some negative GD values contain spaces (e.g., "- 10").

Step 1 — Inspect the table contents
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position;

Results (ordered by position):
position | team            | points | played | against | difference
1 | flamengo        | 13 | 8 | 12 | 8
2 | fluminense      | 13 | 8 | 15 | 10
3 | corinthians     | 9  | 8 | 15 | 4
4 | palestra itália | 8  | 8 | 19 | 3
5 | portuguesa      | 7  | 8 | 23 | - 10
6 | botafogo        | 6  | 8 | 25 | 0
7 | vasco da gama   | 6  | 8 | 19 | - 2
8 | américa         | 6  | 8 | 25 | - 10
9 | são paulo       | 4  | 8 | 24 | - 13

Step 2 — Are there any teams tied on points?
Executed SQL:
SELECT points, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY points
ORDER BY team_count DESC, points DESC;

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tied_points_values
FROM (
  SELECT points
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  GROUP BY points
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
) sub;

Findings:
- points = 6 → 3 teams
- points = 13 → 2 teams
- Distinct tied points values = 2
Conclusion: The assertion “no team is tied on points” is contradicted by the data.

Step 3 — If we look at teams tied on points, are they separated by >1 in goal difference?
Method: Clean goal difference by removing spaces and casting to integer; compute minimum absolute GD separation among teams tied on the same points.
Executed SQL:
SELECT points, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY points
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY points DESC;

Executed SQL:
SELECT t1.points,
       MIN(ABS((REPLACE(t1.difference,' ',''))::int - (REPLACE(t2.difference,' ',''))::int)) AS min_abs_goal_diff_sep
FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football t1
JOIN t_1940_in_brazilian_football t2
  ON t1.points = t2.points AND t1.team < t2.team
GROUP BY t1.points
ORDER BY t1.points DESC;

Findings:
- For points = 13 (flamengo 8 GD vs fluminense 10 GD): min separation = 2
- For points = 6 (botafogo 0, vasco da gama -2, américa -10): minimum pairwise separation = 2
Conclusion: Among teams tied on points, the goal-difference separation is at least 2 (>1) in this table.

Step 4 — Are most adjacent teams (by position) separated by more than 1 in goal difference?
Method: Compute absolute GD gap to the immediately higher-placed team (using cleaned GD values).
Executed SQL (per-position gaps):
SELECT position, team, points, replace(difference, ' ', '')::integer AS gd,
       lag(replace(difference, ' ', '')::integer) OVER (ORDER BY position) AS prev_gd,
       CASE WHEN lag(replace(difference, ' ', '')::integer) OVER (ORDER BY position) IS NULL THEN NULL
            ELSE abs(replace(difference, ' ', '')::integer - lag(replace(difference, ' ', '')::integer) OVER (ORDER BY position))
       END AS gap
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
ORDER BY position;

Executed SQL (aggregate counts):
SELECT
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE gap > 1) AS gaps_gt_1,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE gap = 1) AS gaps_eq_1,
  count(*) FILTER (WHERE gap = 0) AS gaps_eq_0
FROM (
  SELECT abs(replace(difference,' ', '')::integer - lag(replace(difference,' ', '')::integer) OVER (ORDER BY position)) AS gap
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
) t
WHERE gap IS NOT NULL;

Key per-position gaps: 2, 6, 1, 13, 10, 2, 8, 3 (first row has no previous)
Aggregate:
- gaps > 1: 7
- gaps = 1: 1
- gaps = 0: 0
Conclusion: Most adjacent teams (7 of 8 pairs) are separated by more than 1 in goal difference.

Overall assessment of the claim
- “No team is tied on points”: False (contradicted by evidence of ties at 13 and 6 points).
- “Most [teams] be separate by more than 1 goal difference”: Supported under two reasonable readings:
  • Among adjacent positions, 7/8 GD gaps > 1.
  • Among tied-on-points groups, the minimum GD separation is 2 (>1).

Final conclusion: Because the first clause is incorrect while the second clause is supported, the overall claim is a mix of true and false elements.

Assumptions
- Treated column “difference” as goal difference; cleaned spaces from negative values before casting to integer.
- Interpreted “most be separate by more than 1 goal difference” as either (a) the majority of adjacent teams by position have GD gaps >1, and also checked (b) within tied-on-points groups, GD separation >1.
- Interpreted the table as a standings table for 1940 Brazilian football, with “position” defining the rank order for adjacency analyses.
