Claim interpreted: “Women’s gymnastics (w gymnastics) is the sport with the earliest date in 2007.”

Data source checked: TabFact database, table public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date [text], site [text], sport [text], winning team [text], series [text]).

What the data shows
- The earliest dated event in 2007 is 2007-09-04, and its sport is m golf (men’s golf), not women’s gymnastics.
- A full per-sport earliest-date list for 2007 confirms m golf is first; women’s gymnastics does not appear among 2007 entries.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Identify 2007 date strings and their formats
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE date LIKE '%2007%' ORDER BY date LIMIT 100;
Returned rows (sample):
- "december 5 , 2007"
- "december 7 , 2007"
- "december 8 , 2007"
- "december 9 , 2007"
- "november 10 , 2007"
- "september 15 , 2007"
- "september 4 , 2007"
- "september 8 , 2007"
- "september 9 , 2007"

2) Compute earliest date in 2007
SQL:
SELECT MIN(to_date(date, 'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY')) AS earliest_date FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE date LIKE '%2007%';
Result:
- earliest_date: 2007-09-04

3) Sport(s) on the earliest 2007 date
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT sport FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE to_date(date, 'FMMonth FMDD , YYYY') = DATE '2007-09-04';
Result:
- sport: m golf

4) Earliest date per sport in 2007 (ordered)
SQL:
SELECT sport, MIN(to_date(replace(date,' , ',' '),'FMMonth FMDD YYYY'))::date AS earliest_date
FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE date LIKE '%2007%'
GROUP BY sport
ORDER BY earliest_date ASC;
Returned rows:
1. m golf — 2007-09-04
2. volleyball — 2007-09-08
3. w soccer — 2007-09-09
4. football — 2007-09-15
5. w cross country — 2007-11-10
6. m cross country — 2007-11-10
7. w basketball — 2007-12-05
8. w swimming — 2007-12-07
9. m basketball — 2007-12-08
10. wrestling — 2007-12-09

Conclusion
- Women’s gymnastics is not the earliest sport dated in 2007 in this dataset; the earliest is men’s golf on 2007-09-04.

Assumptions
- “w gymnastics” refers to women’s gymnastics.
- “Earliest date in 2007” means the chronologically first event in rows where the date text contains “2007”.
- The date strings are parsed using to_date with the observed textual format (month name, day, comma, year).
