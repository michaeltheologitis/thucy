Claim interpreted: “Olympic Games held at Venice, Italy in 1984 have note 2:10:57.” We verify this against the available authoritative dataset (public.orlando_pizzolato), which records competitions, venues, positions, and notes for Orlando Pizzolato.

Key evidence from data
1) Are there any 1984 entries labeled Olympic Games?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.orlando_pizzolato WHERE year = 1984 AND competition ILIKE '%Olympic%';
- Result: No rows found.

2) What entries exist for 1984?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM orlando_pizzolato WHERE year = 1984;
- Result (1 row): year: 1984; competition: new york city marathon; venue: new york , united states; position: 1st; notes: 2:14:53.

3) Are there any entries for Venice, Italy?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.orlando_pizzolato WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%venice%';
- Result (1 row): year: 1988; competition: venice marathon; venue: venice , italy; position: 1st; notes: 2:15:24.

4) Are there any entries with note 2:10:57?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes
  FROM orlando_pizzolato
  WHERE notes = '2:10:57' OR notes LIKE '%2:10:57%';
- Result (1 row): year: 1986; competition: european championships; venue: stuttgart , west germany; position: 2nd; notes: 2:10:57.

5) Any Olympic Games entries at Venice?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.orlando_pizzolato
  WHERE competition ILIKE 'olympic games'
    AND venue ILIKE '%venice%';
- Result: No rows found.

Assessment of claim components
- “Olympic Games … in 1984”: No 1984 Olympic Games entry in this dataset; the only 1984 entry is the New York City Marathon (notes 2:14:53).
- “… held at Venice, Italy”: Venice appears only in 1988 for the Venice Marathon (notes 2:15:24), not for the Olympic Games.
- “… note 2:10:57”: The note 2:10:57 exists, but it corresponds to the 1986 European Championships in Stuttgart, not an Olympic event, not in 1984, and not in Venice.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data: there is no 1984 Olympic Games entry, no Olympic Games held at Venice, and the 2:10:57 note corresponds to a different event, year, and venue.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to an event record as represented in the public.orlando_pizzolato table, interpreting “note 2:10:57” as the notes field value, and “Olympic Games held at Venice, Italy in 1984” as the competition and venue/year fields.
