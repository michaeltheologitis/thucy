Claim to verify: "the person with a qb rating of 82.7 score 136 touchdown"

Data discovery and grounding:
- Discovered available data source: a PostgreSQL instance labeled as the TabFact database.
- Identified relevant table via schema inspection:
  - public.my_info_table with columns: name, completions, attempts, completion %, yards, touchdowns, interceptions, qb rating.

Evidence from executed SQL:
- Purpose: Find the player whose qb rating equals 82.7 and check their touchdowns value.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "qb rating", touchdowns
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE "qb rating" = 82.7
  ORDER BY name;
- Result:
  - name: neil lomax; qb rating: 82.7; touchdowns: 136

Analysis:
- The table shows a player (neil lomax) with a qb rating of 82.7 and a touchdowns value of 136. This directly supports the claim that the person with a qb rating of 82.7 “score 136 touchdown.”

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Touchdown” refers to the touchdowns field in this quarterback statistics table, which is typically passing touchdowns for QBs.
- “Person” refers to the player record in the identified table (public.my_info_table).
