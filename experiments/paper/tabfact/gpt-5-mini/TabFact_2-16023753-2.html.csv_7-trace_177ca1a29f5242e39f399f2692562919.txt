Claim being checked:
- “the most point score by the dolphin in a game be 34 point.”

Scope and data available:
- Accessible data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season with columns (week, date, opponent, result, attendance).
- The result column stores outcomes like “w 34 - 24” or “l 38 - 35”, where the first number is the winner’s points and the second number is the loser’s points.

What the data shows (1983 season):
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm result format
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week LIMIT 10;
- Evidence excerpt (rows include):
  • week 2 | opponent: new england patriots | result: w 34 - 24
  • week 6 | opponent: buffalo bills | result: l 38 - 35
  This confirms the pattern: winner’s score appears first; thus Dolphins’ points are the first number on wins and the second number on losses.

2) Parse all games and compute Dolphins’ points per game; then find the maximum
- Executed SQL (parsing and preview):
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
      (substring(result from '([0-9]+) - [0-9]+'))::int AS winner_pts,
      (substring(result from '[0-9]+ - ([0-9]+)'))::int AS loser_pts
    FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  )
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, winner_pts, loser_pts,
    CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w %' THEN winner_pts ELSE loser_pts END AS dolphins_pts
  FROM parsed
  ORDER BY week;

- Executed SQL (maximum Dolphins points):
  SELECT MAX(
    CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w %' THEN (substring(result from '([0-9]+) - [0-9]+'))::int
         ELSE (substring(result from '[0-9]+ - ([0-9]+)'))::int
    END
  ) AS max_dolphins_pts
  FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;

- Result: max_dolphins_pts = 38

3) Identify the game(s) with that maximum
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
      (substring(result from '([0-9]+) - [0-9]+'))::int AS winner_pts,
      (substring(result from '[0-9]+ - ([0-9]+)'))::int AS loser_pts
    FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  )
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
    CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w %' THEN winner_pts ELSE loser_pts END AS dolphins_pts
  FROM parsed
  WHERE (CASE WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w %' THEN winner_pts ELSE loser_pts END) = 38
  ORDER BY week;

- Result: Week 13 vs cincinnati bengals on november 28 , 1983 — result: "w 38 - 14" — Dolphins points: 38

4) Additional context: all games with Dolphins ≥ 34 points (to show 34 is not the max)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
         CASE
           WHEN lower(left(result,1)) = 'w' THEN CAST(trim(split_part(result,' ',2)) AS integer)
           WHEN lower(left(result,1)) = 'l' THEN CAST(trim(split_part(result,' ',4)) AS integer)
           ELSE NULL
         END AS dolphins_points
  FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  WHERE (CASE
           WHEN lower(left(result,1)) = 'w' THEN CAST(trim(split_part(result,' ',2)) AS integer)
           WHEN lower(left(result,1)) = 'l' THEN CAST(trim(split_part(result,' ',4)) AS integer)
           ELSE NULL
         END) >= 34
  ORDER BY week;

- Result summary:
  • Week 2 — w 34 - 24 — Dolphins points: 34
  • Week 6 — l 38 - 35 — Dolphins points: 35
  • Week 12 — w 37 - 0 — Dolphins points: 37
  • Week 13 — w 38 - 14 — Dolphins points: 38
  • Week 16 — w 34 - 14 — Dolphins points: 34

Conclusion based on available data:
- For the 1983 Miami Dolphins season, the most points scored by the Dolphins in a single game was 38, not 34. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data available to us.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Miami Dolphins and “most point score in a game” means the maximum points the Dolphins scored in any single game.
- Due to available data, the verification is scoped to the 1983 regular season (table public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season).
