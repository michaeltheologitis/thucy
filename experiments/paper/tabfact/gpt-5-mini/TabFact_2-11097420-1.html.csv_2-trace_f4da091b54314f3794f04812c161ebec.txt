Claim to verify: "there be 2 project in rankin county , sonford product and flowood site"

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (columns include: cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted)

Evidence 1: List the sites in Rankin County
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, county
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE county ILIKE '%Rankin%'
ORDER BY name;

Result:
- flowood site — rankin
- sonford products — rankin

Evidence 2: Count the sites in Rankin County
Executed SQL (two variants attempted; the substring match produced the final count):
1) SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(county)) = 'rankin county';

2) SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE LOWER(county) LIKE '%rankin%';

Result: 2

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly two Superfund sites in Rankin County, named "sonford products" and "flowood site." This aligns with the claim, with a minor naming difference: the table records "sonford products" (plural) rather than "sonford product."

Assumptions
- "project" refers to Superfund sites as listed in the table "list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi."
- County values may appear as "Rankin" or "Rankin County," so a case-insensitive substring match was used to ensure complete capture.
