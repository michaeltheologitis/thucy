Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public. Identified table: public.dundee_hurricanes with columns [season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes].

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, wins FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season IN (2003, 2004) ORDER BY season;
- Result:
  • 2003 — wins: 6
  • 2004 — wins: 6

Analysis
- The wins column shows 6 wins in both 2003 and 2004. Therefore, the Dundee Hurricanes won the same number of games in those two seasons.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win the same number of game” as “had the same number of wins,” using the wins field in the dundee_hurricanes table.
