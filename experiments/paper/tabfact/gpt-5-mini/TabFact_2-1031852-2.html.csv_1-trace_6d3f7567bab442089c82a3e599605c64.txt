Summary conclusion: The data shows multiple Houston-affiliated seasons with a non-empty postseason record. Therefore, the claim that “houston have no post - season record” is contradicted by the evidence in the available dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact17 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.lexington_legends, which includes a column named "post - season record" and an "mlb affiliate" column.

Schema context (from schema inspection)
- Table: lexington_legends
  - Columns: season, manager, record, win %, post - season record, post - season win %, mlb affiliate
  - This table directly tracks postseason records at the season level.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify seasons affiliated with Houston and show postseason record
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "season", "post - season record", "mlb affiliate" FROM public.lexington_legends WHERE "mlb affiliate" ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result (season — post - season record):
  - 2001 — 4 - 0
  - 2002 — -
  - 2003 ♦ — 0 - 2
  - 2004 — -
  - 2005 — -
  - 2006 ♦ — 0 - 2
  - 2007 — -
  - 2008 — -
  - 2009 — -
  - 2010 — -
  - 2011 — -
  - 2012 — -
- Interpretation: There are clearly Houston-affiliated seasons with a non-empty postseason record (e.g., 2001: 4-0; 2003: 0-2; 2006: 0-2).

2) Confirm how “Houston” appears in the affiliate column
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "mlb affiliate", COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  GROUP BY "mlb affiliate"
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, "mlb affiliate";
- Results:
  - houston — 12 rows
  - kansas city — 1 row
- Interpretation: The affiliate is recorded as lowercase "houston" in the data.

3) Count of Houston-affiliated seasons with vs. without a postseason record
- SQL executed:
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN ("post - season record" IS NULL OR trim("post - season record") = '' OR trim("post - season record") = '-') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS no_postseason_record,
    SUM(CASE WHEN NOT ("post - season record" IS NULL OR trim("post - season record") = '' OR trim("post - season record") = '-') THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS has_postseason_record,
    COUNT(*) as total
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  WHERE lower("mlb affiliate") = 'houston';
- Returned: {"no_postseason_record": 9, "has_postseason_record": 3, "total": 12}
- Interpretation: Of 12 Houston-affiliated seasons, 3 have a non-empty postseason record.

Assessment
- The claim “houston have no post - season record” is false in this dataset. There are explicitly recorded postseason records for Houston-affiliated seasons.

Assumptions
- “houston” refers to the value present in the "mlb affiliate" column of the lexington_legends table (the only available dataset referencing Houston). If the intent was the Houston MLB/NBA/NFL franchise broadly, that data is not present here; conclusions are based strictly on the available table.
