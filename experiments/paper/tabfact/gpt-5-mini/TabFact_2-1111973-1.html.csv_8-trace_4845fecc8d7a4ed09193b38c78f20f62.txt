Claim interpreted (broken into checkable parts):
- VCLC weighs 32 t (35.3 tons).
- VCLC armament includes 160 mm (6.3 in) or 350 mm (13.8 in) rockets.
- VCRT armament includes a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun.
- “have the same VCPC” interpreted as VCLC and VCPC share at least one key performance figure; I test maximum speed and note any differences in other figures.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: postgres_tabfact8 (schema: public)
  - Table: tam_tank with columns: vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt (text fields)

Primary evidence (exact SQL and returned results)
1) Full table inspection
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
Key returned rows relevant to this claim (abbreviated to pertinent columns):
- Row (weights): vclc = "32t (35.3tons)", vcpc = "25t (27.6tons)", vcrt = "32t (35.3tons)"
- Row (armament): vclc = "160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets"; vcpc = "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"; vcrt = "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
- Row (power-to-weight): vclc = "22.5hp / t (20.4hp / ton)", vcpc = "28.8hp / t (25.1hp / ton)", vcrt = "22.5hp / t (20.4hp / ton)"
- Row (max speed): vclc = "75 km / h (47 mph)", vcpc = "75 km / h (47 mph)", vcrt = "75 km / h (47 mph)"

2) Verify VCLC weight = 32t (35.3 tons)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM tam_tank WHERE vclc ILIKE '%32t%' OR vclc ILIKE '%35.3%';
Result (matching row): vclc = "32t (35.3tons)" (and other variants’ weights shown alongside)
Conclusion: Supported.

3) Verify VCLC rockets = 160 mm or 350 mm
SQL:
SELECT * FROM tam_tank WHERE vclc ILIKE '%160 mm%' OR vclc ILIKE '%6.3in%' OR vclc ILIKE '%350 mm%' OR vclc ILIKE '%13.8in%';
Result (matching row): vclc = "160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets"
Conclusion: Supported.

4) Verify VCRT armament = 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20
SQL:
SELECT * FROM tam_tank WHERE vcrt ILIKE '%FN MAG%';
Result (matching row): vcrt = "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
Conclusion: Supported.

5) Interpret “have the same VCPC” – test maximum speed parity between VCLC and VCPC
5a) Extract max VCLC speed
SQL:
SELECT max((substring(vclc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision) AS max_vclc FROM tam_tank WHERE vclc ILIKE '%km%';
Result: max_vclc = 75
5b) Retrieve the row showing 75 km/h for VCLC and compare VCPC
SQL:
SELECT *, (substring(vclc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision AS vclc_num FROM tam_tank WHERE vclc ILIKE '%km%' AND (substring(vclc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision = 75;
Result row: vclc = "75 km / h (47 mph)", vcpc = "75 km / h (47 mph)"
5c) Extract max VCPC speed
SQL:
SELECT max((substring(vcpc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision) AS max_vcpc FROM tam_tank WHERE vcpc ILIKE '%km%';
Result: max_vcpc = 75
5d) Retrieve the row showing 75 km/h for VCPC and compare VCLC
SQL:
SELECT *, (substring(vcpc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision AS vcpc_num FROM tam_tank WHERE vcpc ILIKE '%km%' AND (substring(vcpc from '([0-9]+(?:\\.[0-9]+)?)'))::double precision = 75;
Result row: vcpc = "75 km / h (47 mph)", vclc = "75 km / h (47 mph)"
Conclusion: VCLC and VCPC share the same maximum speed (75 km/h). Note: They do not share the same weight (VCLC 32t vs VCPC 25t) and have different power-to-weight figures in the dataset.

Assessment of each claim component
- VCLC 32t (35.3 tons): Verified by evidence (Queries 1 and 2).
- VCLC rockets 160 mm or 350 mm: Verified by evidence (Queries 1 and 3).
- VCRT 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun: Verified by evidence (Queries 1 and 4).
- “have the same VCPC”: Ambiguous; if interpreted as sharing the same maximum speed, it is supported (Query set 5). They are not the same in weight or power-to-weight, so any broader interpretation of “the same” would not be fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- I treated “have the same VCPC” as referring to a shared key performance figure; I tested maximum speed specifically (since the table clearly lists comparable speed values by variant).
- I considered the five rows in tam_tank as different attribute categories (weights, armament, range placeholder, power-to-weight, max speed), with each variant represented by a column.
