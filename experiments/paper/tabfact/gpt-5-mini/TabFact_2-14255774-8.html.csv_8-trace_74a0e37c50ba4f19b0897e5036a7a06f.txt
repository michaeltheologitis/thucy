Claim interpreted: “Rosales of the Arizona Diamondbacks has more losses than Johnson.” Given the available data source only contains a game log table for (a subset of) the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season, I verify the claim by counting how often the losing pitcher listed in that table has the last name “rosales” versus “johnson.”

Data source discovery
- I first identified the available database objects.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 15;
Observation: The table public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text) holds game-level entries. The “loss” column contains the losing pitcher’s last name followed by that pitcher’s W-L record in parentheses (e.g., “mcclellan (2 - 7)”).

Table scope
- How many total games are in this table?
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result: total_games = 26

Direct test of the claim within this data
1) Count games where the losing pitcher’s last name contains “rosales” vs “johnson”.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rosales_count FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE lower(loss) LIKE '%rosales%';
Result: rosales_count = 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS johnson_count FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE lower(loss) LIKE '%johnson%';
Result: johnson_count = 1

2) Show the specific rows to confirm context.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE lower(loss) LIKE '%rosales%'
ORDER BY date;
Result row:
- september 25 | cardinals | 12 - 3 | rosales (1 - 1) | 79 - 80

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE lower(loss) LIKE '%johnson%'
ORDER BY date;
Result row:
- september 23 | cardinals | 7 - 4 | johnson (10 - 10) | 79 - 78

3) Confirm which “Johnson” appears (string-level):
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT loss FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE loss ILIKE '%johnson%';
Result: johnson (10 - 10)

Conclusion
- Within the available 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks game log table (26 games), the losing pitcher listed as “rosales” appears exactly once, and the losing pitcher listed as “johnson” also appears exactly once. Therefore, Rosales does not have more losses than Johnson in this dataset; they are equal.

Answer: The claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and limitations
- The only accessible data is a single table covering 26 games from the 2008 Diamondbacks season (likely a late-season subset). I treated this table as authoritative for what it contains but note it is not a full-season or multi-season record.
- I interpreted “have more loss” as “appears more times as the losing pitcher in the provided game log.”
- Matching was case-insensitive on the last name substrings in the loss column; the table does not include first names or team attribution for the losing pitcher beyond the context of the game.
- If the user intended a different timeframe (full season or career) or a specific Johnson (e.g., Randy Johnson) and Rosales (specific individual), that information is not present in this dataset and was not inferable here.
