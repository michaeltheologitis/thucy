Claim interpreted: “Phil Mickelson is the only player from the United States.” Given the available data sources, I interpret this claim in the context of the accessible golf-related table t_1996_pga_championship.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact6 (TabFact)
- Relevant table found: public.t_1996_pga_championship (columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money)

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
1) Distinct players from the United States (case-insensitive match on country):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(country) = 'united states' ORDER BY player;
Results:
- justin leonard
- kenny perry
- larry mize
- lee janzen
- mark brooks
- phil mickelson
- tommy tolles

2) Count of distinct players from the United States:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS us_player_count FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(country) = 'united states';
Result:
- us_player_count: 7

3) Presence check for Phil Mickelson among U.S. players:
SQL:
SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE lower(country) = 'united states' AND lower(player) = 'phil mickelson') AS phil_present;
Result:
- phil_present: true

4) Country breakdown (distinct players per country) for context:
SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship GROUP BY country ORDER BY player_count DESC, country;
Results:
- united states: 7
- sweden: 2
- australia: 1
- fiji: 1
- new zealand: 1
- zimbabwe: 1

And with player lists per country:
SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count, STRING_AGG(DISTINCT player, ', ' ORDER BY player) AS players FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship GROUP BY country ORDER BY player_count DESC, country;
Results:
- united states (7): justin leonard, kenny perry, larry mize, lee janzen, mark brooks, phil mickelson, tommy tolles
- sweden (2): jesper parnevik, per - ulrik johansson
- australia (1): steve elkington
- fiji (1): vijay singh
- new zealand (1): frank nobilo
- zimbabwe (1): nick price

Conclusion:
The data shows there are seven players from the United States in this table, including Phil Mickelson. Therefore, the claim that Phil Mickelson is the only player from the United States is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- Due to the claim’s ambiguity, I assumed the relevant context is the available golf dataset in the discovered database, specifically the t_1996_pga_championship table. Matching for “United States” and the player name was done case-insensitively.
