Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected schema before verification.
- Queried the only available table (public.pocono_400) for evidence related to the claim.

Data source discovery
- Accessible asset: PostgreSQL TabFact database (public schema) with one table: public.pocono_400.

Schema snapshot
- public.pocono_400 columns: year (bigint), date (text), driver (text), team (text), manufacturer (text), laps (bigint), '-' (text), race time (text), average speed (mph) (double precision), report (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Who is listed for 1997 and how many laps?
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, laps FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE year = 1997;
- Result:
  - driver: jeff gordon; laps: 200
- Interpretation: For 1997, the table attributes 200 laps to Jeff Gordon, not Jeremy Mayfield.

2) Does Jeremy Mayfield appear, and in which years/laps?
- SQL:
  SELECT year, driver, laps FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE lower(driver) = 'jeremy mayfield';
- Results:
  - year: 1998; driver: jeremy mayfield; laps: 200
  - year: 2000; driver: jeremy mayfield; laps: 200
- Interpretation: Jeremy Mayfield is listed with 200 laps in 1998 and 2000, but not in 1997.

Conclusion
- The data show that in 1997 the driver recorded with 200 laps is Jeff Gordon. Jeremy Mayfield has 200 laps in other years (1998, 2000). Therefore, the claim that “jeremy mayfield [was] the driver with 200 lap in 1997” is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Pocono 400 table’s record for the year 1997, with “200 lap” corresponding to the table’s laps column (total race laps associated with that year’s entry). No other relevant tables were available in the data environment to broaden the context.
