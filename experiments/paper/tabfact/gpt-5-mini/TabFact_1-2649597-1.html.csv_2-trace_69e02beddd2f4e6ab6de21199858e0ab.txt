Claim interpreted: Shane Hall ran more races with Stegell Motorsports than with any other team.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14). Public schema contains a table named public.shane_hall with columns including year, races, and team (s).

Key evidence from the data
1) Total races by team (s)
SQL:
SELECT "team (s)" AS team, SUM(races) AS total_races
FROM public.shane_hall
GROUP BY "team (s)"
ORDER BY total_races DESC;
Result:
- stegell motorsports — 75
- hensley racing — 57
- curb - agajanian performance group — 25
- jay robinson racing — 22
- moy racing / jay robinson racing — 9
- alumni motorsports — 2

2) Identify the team(s) with the maximum total races
SQL:
SELECT MAX(total_races) AS max_total FROM (
  SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races FROM public.shane_hall GROUP BY "team (s)"
) t;
Result:
- max_total = 75

SQL:
SELECT "team (s)" AS team, SUM(races) AS total_races
FROM public.shane_hall
GROUP BY "team (s)"
HAVING SUM(races) = 75;
Result:
- stegell motorsports — 75

3) Year-by-year breakdown for Stegell Motorsports
SQL:
SELECT "year", races FROM public.shane_hall
WHERE "team (s)" ILIKE 'stegell motorsports'
ORDER BY "year";
Result:
- 1995 — 2
- 1996 — 14
- 1997 — 28
- 1998 — 31

SQL:
SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races FROM public.shane_hall
WHERE "team (s)" ILIKE 'stegell motorsports';
Result:
- total_races — 75

Conclusion
- Verified by the dataset: Stegell Motorsports has the highest total number of races (75) for Shane Hall, exceeding any other team listed.

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim to mean: “Shane Hall ran more races with Stegell Motorsports than with any other team,” based on the contents of the public.shane_hall table.
- The column team (s) is treated exactly as stored (no splitting of combined entries like “moy racing / jay robinson racing”). Even if that year were split between those teams, the totals would not surpass Stegell Motorsports’ 75.
- The dataset is taken as authoritative for Shane Hall’s recorded seasons (1995–2008 in this table).
