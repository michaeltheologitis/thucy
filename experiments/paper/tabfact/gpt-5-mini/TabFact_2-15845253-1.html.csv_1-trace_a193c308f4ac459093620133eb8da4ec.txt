Claim: 14 viral family have a replication site in the cytoplasm.

Data source overview:
- Connected database: viral_disease (public schema)
- Table: public.viral_disease
  Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Method:
- Count distinct viral families by replication site and verify the count for cytoplasm.
- List the viral families whose replication site is cytoplasm to validate the count.
- Confirm with an exact (case-insensitive) equality check on the replication site value.

Evidence:
1) Distinct replication sites and number of distinct families per site
SQL executed:
SELECT "replication site", COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS family_count
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "replication site"
ORDER BY family_count DESC, "replication site";
Result:
- replication site = cytoplasm — family_count = 14
- replication site = nucleus — family_count = 9

2) Exact case-insensitive equality check for cytoplasm
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
FROM public.viral_disease
WHERE lower("replication site") = 'cytoplasm';
Result:
- distinct_family_count = 14

Robustness check (trim + case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
FROM public.viral_disease
WHERE lower(trim("replication site")) = 'cytoplasm';
Result:
- distinct_family_count = 14

3) List of distinct viral families with replication site containing “cytoplasm” (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT family
FROM public.viral_disease
WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%cytoplasm%'
ORDER BY family;
Result (14 families):
- Arenaviridae
- Astroviridae
- Bunyaviridae
- Caliciviridae
- Coronaviridae
- Filoviridae
- Flaviviridae
- Hepeviridae
- Paramyxoviridae
- Picornaviridae
- Poxviridae
- Reoviridae
- Rhabdoviridae
- Togaviridae

Conclusion:
- The database shows exactly 14 distinct viral families with a replication site in the cytoplasm. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “viral family” as the distinct values in the family column.
- Interpreted “replication site in the cytoplasm” as entries where replication site equals “cytoplasm” (case-insensitive). The ILIKE containment list matches and corroborates the equality-based counts.
