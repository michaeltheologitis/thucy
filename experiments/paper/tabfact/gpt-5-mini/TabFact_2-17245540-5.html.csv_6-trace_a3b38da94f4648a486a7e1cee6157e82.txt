Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact / postgres_tabfact24) with one table in the public schema: public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf.
- Table structure:
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)
  - No primary/foreign keys.

Claim interpreted:
- The claim asserts that Arnold Palmer’s place is T3 (tied for 3rd). Given the only available dataset is the 1973 U.S. Open golf results, I verify this within that context.

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Retrieve Arnold Palmer’s row
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Arnold%Palmer%';
Result:
- place: t6
- player: arnold palmer
- country: united states
- score: 71 + 71 = 142
- to par: e

2) Check who is recorded as T3 (noting the table stores tied places in lowercase 't3')
SQL:
SELECT player FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't3' ORDER BY player;
Result:
- bob charles
- jack nicklaus
- johnny miller

3) Confirm how place values are stored
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;
Result:
- 1
- 2
- t3
- t6

Conclusion:
- In the 1973 U.S. Open dataset, Arnold Palmer’s place is t6 (tied for sixth), not t3. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1973 U.S. Open (the only available golf dataset here).
- "T3" means tied for 3rd place.
- Case-insensitive matching is appropriate for player names stored in lowercase in the table.
