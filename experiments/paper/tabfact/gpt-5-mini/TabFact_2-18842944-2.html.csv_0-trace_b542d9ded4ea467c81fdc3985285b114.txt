Summary
- Interpreted claim: “There are 2 games that take place in the month of December.” I grounded this against the available TabFact database, which exposes a single relevant table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season, containing game dates for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One accessible data source: a PostgreSQL instance for the TabFact dataset (public schema). 

Schema exploration
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Found table public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season with columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence collection
1) Inspect all rows to confirm date values and format
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Observed relevant rows (date column shows month names in lowercase, e.g., “december 5 , 1976”):
- 13 | december 5 , 1976 | miami dolphins | l 45 - 27 | 43475
- 14 | december 12 , 1976 | baltimore colts | l 58 - 20 | 50451

2) Count December games
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS december_games FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE date ILIKE '%dec%';
Result:
- december_games: 2

3) List the December games for confirmation
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE date ILIKE '%dec%' ORDER BY week;
Results:
- week: 13, date: "december 5 , 1976", opponent: "miami dolphins", result: "l 45 - 27", attendance: 43475
- week: 14, date: "december 12 , 1976", opponent: "baltimore colts", result: "l 58 - 20", attendance: 50451

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 2 games in December. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the games within the available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season). 
- Matching December dates by date ILIKE '%dec%' is appropriate given the observed date format (e.g., “december 5 , 1976”).
