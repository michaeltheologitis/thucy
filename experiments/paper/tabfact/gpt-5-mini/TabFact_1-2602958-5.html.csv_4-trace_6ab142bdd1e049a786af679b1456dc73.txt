Claim to verify: Episode number 67 (“The Lorelais' First Day at Yale”) has 1.6 million fewer viewers than episode 69 (“Chicken or Beef?”).

Data source discovery:
- Discovered PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23), schema public.
- Relevant table: list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes.

Schema details (summarized):
- Columns: no (bigint), - (bigint), title (text), director (text), writer (s) (text), original air date (text), prod code (bigint), us viewers (million) (double precision).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve episodes 67 and 69 with titles and U.S. viewers (in millions)
SQL:
SELECT no, title, "us viewers (million)" FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no IN (67, 69) ORDER BY no;
Result:
- no: 67, title: the lorelais' first day at yale, us viewers (million): 3.9
- no: 69, title: chicken or beef, us viewers (million): 5.5

2) Compute difference in viewers (episode 69 minus episode 67)
SQL:
SELECT ( (SELECT "us viewers (million)" FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no=69) - (SELECT "us viewers (million)" FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no=67) ) AS viewers_difference;
Result:
- viewers_difference: 1.6 (million)

Analysis:
- Episode 67’s title in the data matches “the lorelais' first day at yale”. Episode 69’s title appears as “chicken or beef” (without a trailing question mark). This is a minor formatting difference.
- Viewership: Ep 67 = 3.9M; Ep 69 = 5.5M; Difference = 1.6M. Therefore, episode 67 had 1.6 million fewer U.S. viewers than episode 69, matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- Column “no” represents overall episode number across the series.
- “us viewers (million)” represents U.S. viewership in millions for each episode.
- Minor punctuation/capitalization differences in titles do not affect verification.
