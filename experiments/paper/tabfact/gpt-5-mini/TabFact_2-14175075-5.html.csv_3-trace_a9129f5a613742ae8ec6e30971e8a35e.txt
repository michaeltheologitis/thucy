Claim to verify: “w gymnastics be the sport with the earliest date in 2008.”

Data sources discovered
- TabFact database (public schema) with a single relevant table: public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  - Columns: date (TEXT), site (TEXT), sport (TEXT), winning team (TEXT), series (TEXT)

Approach
- Parse the TEXT date values into SQL DATEs.
- Filter rows to the year 2008.
- Order by the parsed date ascending to identify the earliest event and its sport.

Executed SQL evidence and results
1) Identify all 2008 rows, parse dates, and order to find the earliest event
SQL:
WITH normalized AS (
  SELECT date AS original_date,
         regexp_replace(trim(date), '\s*,\s*', ', ', 'g') AS norm_date,
         sport
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
)
SELECT original_date,
       to_date(norm_date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date,
       sport
FROM normalized
WHERE extract(year FROM to_date(norm_date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) = 2008
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC;

Result rows (earliest first):
- original_date: "february 22 , 2008" | parsed_date: 2008-02-22 | sport: "w gymnastics"
- original_date: "march 7 , 2008"     | parsed_date: 2008-03-07 | sport: "w gymnastics"
- original_date: "april 1 , 2008"     | parsed_date: 2008-04-01 | sport: "softball"

Findings
- The earliest 2008 event in this dataset is on 2008-02-22, and its sport is “w gymnastics.”

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series.

Assumptions
- “w gymnastics” is interpreted as women’s gymnastics as labeled in the sport column.
- “earliest date in 2008” refers to the earliest event date among rows in this table with year 2008.
- Date parsing relied on normalizing spaces around the comma and using to_date with English month names.
