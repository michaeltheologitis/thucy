Claim to verify: "sco have the lowest amount of transfer at 22"

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact12
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee)

What I checked
- Interpreted "amount of transfer" as the number of transfer records per nationality (nat) in the available table. Verified the count for nationality "sco" and compared it to the counts for all other nationalities to determine whether it is the lowest.

Findings from the data
- Counts per nationality show that "sco" has 22 records, which is the highest count, not the lowest. The lowest count is 1, shared by several nationalities.

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Counts per nationality
SQL:
SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY cnt DESC, nat;
Result:
[{"cnt":22,"nat":"sco"},{"cnt":2,"nat":"bel"},{"cnt":2,"nat":"eng"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"cyp"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"esp"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"fra"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"gabon"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"ivory coast"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"rsa"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"slovakia"}]

2) Minimum count across nationalities
SQL:
SELECT MIN(cnt) AS min_count FROM (SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat) sub;
Result:
[{"min_count":1}]

3) Nationalities with the minimum count
SQL:
SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat HAVING COUNT(*) = (SELECT MIN(cnt) FROM (SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat) sub) ORDER BY nat;
Result:
[{"cnt":1,"nat":"cyp"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"esp"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"fra"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"gabon"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"ivory coast"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"rsa"},{"cnt":1,"nat":"slovakia"}]

4) Exact match check for 'SCO' (case-sensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sco_exact_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'SCO';
Result:
[{"sco_exact_count":0}]

5) Case-insensitive check for 'sco'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sco_case_insensitive_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(nat) = 'sco';
Result:
[{"sco_case_insensitive_count":22}]

Conclusion
- The statement is contradicted by the data. While "sco" does have 22 transfer records, that is the highest count, not the lowest. The lowest count is 1, shared by multiple other nationalities.

Assumptions
- "sco" refers to the nationality code stored in the nat column (lowercase 'sco').
- "amount of transfer" is interpreted as the number of transfer records per nationality within this table, as no other transfer-amount field suitable for aggregation is available in the dataset.
