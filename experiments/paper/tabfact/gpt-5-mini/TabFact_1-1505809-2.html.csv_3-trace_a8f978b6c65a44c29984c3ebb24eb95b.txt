Claim interpreted: “48 is the value of ends lost when the blank ends is 9.” We interpret this against the publicly available TabFact PostgreSQL dataset, specifically the table t_2005_tim_hortons_brier, which contains the columns “ends lost” and “blank ends.”

Data discovery and schema context:
- Discovered data sources: One PostgreSQL database via TabFact with a public schema and 2 tables.
- Relevant table and columns (from schema inspection): t_2005_tim_hortons_brier with columns including “ends won,” “ends lost,” and “blank ends.”

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve rows where blank ends = 9 and show the corresponding ends lost
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT locale, skip, "blank ends", "ends lost" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 9;
- Result:
  One row matches.
  • locale: northern ontario; skip: mike jakubo; blank ends: 9; ends lost: 48.

2) Confirm the count of rows with blank ends = 9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_blank_ends_9 FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 9;
- Result: 1 row.

Assessment:
- The dataset contains exactly one record where “blank ends” equals 9, and its “ends lost” value is 48. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “end lost” refers to the “ends lost” column and “blank end” refers to the “blank ends” column in t_2005_tim_hortons_brier.
- The claim pertains to this dataset (2005 Tim Hortons Brier) within the TabFact database.
- Equality is interpreted as exact numeric match (blank ends = 9).
