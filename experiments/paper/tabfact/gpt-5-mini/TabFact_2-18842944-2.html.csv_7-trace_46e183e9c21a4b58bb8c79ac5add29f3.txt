Claim to verify: “the smallest attendance be not at the game against the new england patriot but against baltimore colt.”

Summary of findings (grounded in the 1976 Buffalo Bills season data):
- The minimum attendance game of the 1976 Buffalo Bills season was against the San Diego Chargers (36,539), not against the New England Patriots or the Baltimore Colts.
- Among Bills games specifically versus the Patriots and the Colts, the smaller attendance occurred in a Patriots game (45,144) rather than a Colts game (the smaller Colts figure was 50,451).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the minimum attendance in the season
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_att FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
- Result:
  min_att = 36539

2) Retrieve the game(s) with that minimum attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season);
- Result:
  week: 11, date: november 21 , 1976, opponent: san diego chargers, attendance: 36539

3) Retrieve games vs. New England Patriots and their attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New England%';
- Results:
  - week: 7, date: october 24 , 1976, opponent: new england patriots, attendance: 45144
  - week: 9, date: november 7 , 1976, opponent: new england patriots, attendance: 61157

4) Retrieve games vs. Baltimore Colts and their attendance
- SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Colt%';
- Results:
  - week: 6, date: october 17 , 1976, opponent: baltimore colts, result: l 31 - 13, attendance: 71009
  - week: 14, date: december 12 , 1976, opponent: baltimore colts, result: l 58 - 20, attendance: 50451

Conclusion
- The smallest attendance of the 1976 Buffalo Bills season was not against the New England Patriots nor against the Baltimore Colts; it was against the San Diego Chargers. Even when comparing only Patriots vs. Colts games, the smaller attendance was in a Patriots game (45,144) rather than a Colts game (50,451). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1976 Buffalo Bills season, based on the available data source (table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season).
