Claim: “there be an 64.64 point difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (122.28).”

Data source explored: TabFact database, public schema, table t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships (columns include: rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Minimum and maximum points
SQL:
SELECT MIN(points) AS min_points, MAX(points) AS max_points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
Result:
[{"max_points":186.92,"min_points":112.28}]

2) Identify rows holding those min and max values
SQL:
SELECT name, nation, points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE points = 112.28 OR points = 186.92;
Result:
[{"name":"linda fratianne","nation":"united states","points":186.92},{"name":"gloria mas","nation":"spain","points":112.28}]

3) Difference between max and min (rounded to two decimals)
SQL:
SELECT ROUND(((SELECT MAX(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships) - (SELECT MIN(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships))::numeric, 2) AS diff_rounded;
Result:
[{"diff_rounded":74.64}]

Assessment:
- The highest score is 186.92 (matches the claim’s highest score).
- The lowest score in the data is 112.28, not 122.28.
- The actual difference is 74.64, not 64.64.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “score” as the “points” column in public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships in the TabFact database, the only accessible dataset relevant to this domain.
