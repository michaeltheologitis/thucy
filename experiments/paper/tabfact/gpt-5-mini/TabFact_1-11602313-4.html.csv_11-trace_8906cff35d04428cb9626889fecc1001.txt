Claim to verify: “the release date for the model with sspec number sla4h (m0) be q2 2008 with part number (s) lf80537 ge0301 m”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact6)
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
  Columns include: "model number", "sspec number", "release date", "part number (s)", among others.

Step 1 — Check for an exact SSPEC match of SLA4H (without stepping)
- Purpose: Ensure whether the table stores the SSPEC exactly as “SLA4H” or with additional text.
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE lower("sspec number") = 'sla4h';
- Result: match_count = 0 (no exact “SLA4H” entries)

Step 2 — Search for any SSPEC entries containing ‘SLA4H’
- Purpose: Find entries where the SSPEC includes stepping text like “(m0)”.
- SQL executed:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "release date", "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE lower("sspec number") LIKE '%sla4h%';
- Result:
  - model number: pentium dual - core t2390
  - sspec number: sla4h (m0)
  - release date: q2 2008
  - part number (s): lf80537 ge0361 m

Step 3 — Verify exact equality to ‘sla4h (m0)’
- Purpose: Confirm the precise row and all fields for the SSPEC including stepping.
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE lower("sspec number") = lower('sla4h (m0)');
- Result (selected fields shown):
  - model number: pentium dual - core t2390
  - sspec number: sla4h (m0)
  - release date: q2 2008
  - part number (s): lf80537 ge0361 m

Findings
- The SSPEC number “SLA4H (M0)” exists and corresponds to Pentium Dual-Core T2390.
- Release date is “Q2 2008” — this matches the claim.
- Part number(s) listed are “LF80537 GE0361 M” — this differs from the claimed “LF80537 GE0301 M”.

Conclusion
- The release date portion of the claim is supported by the data.
- The part number provided in the claim does not match the database entry.

Assumptions
- Matching was done case-insensitively for SSPEC values and part numbers.
- The table includes stepping text within the “sspec number” field; there is no separate “stepping” column to cross-verify M0 apart from the literal string in “sspec number”.
