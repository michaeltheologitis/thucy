Data sources consulted
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing the table: public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes (episode-level metadata for the TV show “Step by Step”).

Evidence
1) Does an episode titled “Great Expectation(s)” exist and who wrote it?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, "written by" FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE lower(title) = 'great expectation' OR lower(title) = 'great expectations';
- Result:
  - title: great expectations
    written by: brian bird & john wierick

Interpretation: The episode titled “Great Expectations” (plural) exists in this dataset and was written by Brian Bird & John Wierick—not Maria A. Brown. No episode titled exactly “Great Expectation” (singular) was found.

2) Did Maria A. Brown write any episodes (for context)?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "title", "written by" FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%maria%';
- Results:
  - down and out in port washington — maria a brown
  - bad girls — maria a brown
  - nightmare weekend — maria a brown

Interpretation: Maria A. Brown is credited as the writer for several episodes, but not for “Great Expectations.”

Conclusion
- The claim that “Maria A. Brown wrote the episode ‘Great Expectation’/‘Great Expectations’” is contradicted by the data. The “Great Expectations” episode is credited to Brian Bird & John Wierick.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “great expectation” to mean the Step by Step episode titled “Great Expectations” (plural), as this is the only relevant episode title present in the available authoritative dataset.
- Verification is limited to the Step by Step episode metadata available in the TabFact database.
