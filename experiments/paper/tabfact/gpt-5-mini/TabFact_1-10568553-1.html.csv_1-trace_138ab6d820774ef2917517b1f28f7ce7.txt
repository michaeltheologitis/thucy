What I checked:
- Claim: “north avenue plain street market street have both 12.2 and 12.8 list in the milepost column.”

Data sources consulted:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Identified table: public.massachusetts_route_139 with a milepost column (text) and a street names column (text)

Step 1 — Confirm relevant table and columns:
- Schema inspection shows public.massachusetts_route_139 includes columns: county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes. The milepost column exists.

Step 2 — Retrieve rows for the specified street names and inspect milepost values:
Executed SQL:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE "street names" ILIKE '%North Avenue%'
   OR "street names" ILIKE '%Plain Street%'
   OR "street names" ILIKE '%Market Street%'
ORDER BY "street names", milepost;

Result:
- county: plymouth | location: rockland | street names: north avenue plain street market street | milepost: 12.2 | roads intersected: route 123 | notes: western terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency
- county: plymouth | location: rockland | street names: north avenue plain street market street | milepost: 12.8 | roads intersected: route 123 | notes: eastern terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency

Step 3 — Verify distinct milepost values exactly for the street names string:
Executed SQL:
SELECT milepost
FROM (
  SELECT DISTINCT milepost, (trim(milepost))::double precision AS mp_num
  FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
  WHERE lower("street names") = 'north avenue plain street market street'
    AND trim(milepost) ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
) AS sub
ORDER BY mp_num;

Result (distinct milepost values):
- 12.2
- 12.8

Conclusion:
- The table contains two entries for the street names value “north avenue plain street market street,” with milepost values 12.2 and 12.8. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the single "street names" value 'north avenue plain street market street' present in public.massachusetts_route_139, and checked whether its milepost values include both 12.2 and 12.8. The match was made case-insensitively.
