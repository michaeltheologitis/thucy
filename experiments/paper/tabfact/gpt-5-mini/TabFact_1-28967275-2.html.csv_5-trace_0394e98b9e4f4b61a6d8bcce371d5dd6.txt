Claim interpreted: There is an episode titled “The Expulsion” (or that Episode 1 is titled “The Expulsion”).

Data source checked
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table with columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), episode title (text), original air date (text), production code (bigint)

Evidence gathered
1) Check for an exact case-insensitive match on the title “The Expulsion”
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("episode title") = lower('The Expulsion');
- Result: match_count = 0

- SQL (details of matching rows):
  SELECT "episode", "series", "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("episode title") = lower('The Expulsion');
- Result: no rows returned

2) Check for any partial match containing “expuls” (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%expuls%';
- Result: match_count = 0

3) Check whether Episode 1 exists in this table (in case the claim meant “Episode 1 is titled ‘The Expulsion’”)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episode = 1;
- Result: match_count = 0

4) Inventory of all episodes in the table (ordered by episode)
- SQL:
  SELECT episode, series, "episode title" FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY episode ASC;
- Result (episodes 27–51):

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no episode titled “The Expulsion” (exact or partial match), and there is no Episode 1 present in this table. The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions due to ambiguity
- I interpreted the fragmented claim as either: (a) “There exists an episode titled ‘The Expulsion’,” or (b) “Episode 1 is titled ‘The Expulsion’.” I verified both interpretations against the available table.
- Title matching was performed case-insensitively and with a partial-match check.
- I treated the available table as the authoritative list of episodes for this dataset.
