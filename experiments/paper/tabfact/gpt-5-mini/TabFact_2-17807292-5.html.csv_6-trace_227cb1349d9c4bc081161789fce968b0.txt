Claim to verify: “henrik stenson be from australia , aaron baddeley be from south korea , and charlie wi be from sweden.”

Data source consulted: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5) database, table public.t_2008_pga_championship with columns (place, player, country, score, to par). This table lists players and their countries for the 2008 PGA Championship.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Query to retrieve the specific players’ countries
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE LOWER(player) IN ('henrik stenson','aaron baddeley','charlie wi') ORDER BY player;
Results:
[{"country":"australia","player":"aaron baddeley"},
 {"country":"south korea","player":"charlie wi"},
 {"country":"sweden","player":"henrik stenson"}]

2) Context query (to confirm names and casing in the table)
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY player;
Results (excerpt relevant to the claim):
[{"country":"australia","player":"aaron baddeley"},
 {"country":"south korea","player":"charlie wi"},
 {"country":"sweden","player":"henrik stenson"}]

Findings:
- Henrik Stenson is listed as from Sweden (not Australia).
- Aaron Baddeley is listed as from Australia (not South Korea).
- Charlie Wi is listed as from South Korea (not Sweden).

Conclusion: All three components of the claim contradict the data in the referenced table.

Assumptions:
- Player-country associations in the 2008 PGA Championship table reflect each golfer’s country/nationality for the purposes of verification.
- Names were matched case-insensitively to align with table storage format (lowercase).
