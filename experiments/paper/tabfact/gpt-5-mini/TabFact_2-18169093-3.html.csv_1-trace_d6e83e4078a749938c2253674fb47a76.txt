Summary
- Claim: In the 1981 Open Championship, there were 8 players tied for 9th.
- Data source explored: TabFact (postgres_tabfact10) database, table public.t_1981_open_championship.
- Finding: The table shows place = 't9' for 8 players, indicating 8 players tied for 9th.

Data source and schema
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact10)
- Table: public.t_1981_open_championship
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text)

Evidence 1: Distinct finishing positions and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS cnt, (place ILIKE 'T%') AS is_tie
FROM t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY place
ORDER BY
  CASE WHEN place ~ '[0-9]' THEN CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(place, '.*?([0-9]+).*', '\\1') AS integer) ELSE 9999 END,
  place;

Result excerpt:
- place = t1, count = 2, is_tie = true
- place = t3, count = 6, is_tie = true
- place = t9, count = 8, is_tie = true
Interpretation: There are 8 entries with place = 't9' (tie for 9th).

Evidence 2: List of players tied for 9th
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't9';

Rows returned (8):
1) place: t9 | player: howard clark   | country: england       | score: 72 | to par: + 2
2) place: t9 | player: ben crenshaw   | country: united states | score: 72 | to par: + 2
3) place: t9 | player: david jagger   | country: england       | score: 72 | to par: + 2

8) place: t9 | player: sam torrance   | country: scotland      | score: 72 | to par: + 2

Conclusion
- The available data directly supports the claim: there are 8 players tied for 9th place in the 1981 Open Championship table.

Assumptions
- Interpreted 't9' in the place column as “tied for 9th.”
- The table likely represents a specific leaderboard slice (e.g., a round leaderboard) rather than final standings; the verification is confined to what this table records.
