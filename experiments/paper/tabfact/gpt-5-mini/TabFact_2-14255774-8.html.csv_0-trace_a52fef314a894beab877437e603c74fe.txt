Claim interpreted: The difference between the highest and lowest fan attendance is 31,521.

Data source discovery:
- Connected database: postgres_tabfact22 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Compute minimum, maximum, and difference in attendance
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_att, MAX(attendance) AS max_att, MAX(attendance)-MIN(attendance) AS difference FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- Minimum attendance: 22616
- Maximum attendance: 54137
- Difference (max - min): 31521

2) Identify the specific games corresponding to those extremes
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance, CASE WHEN attendance = 22616 THEN 'min' WHEN attendance = 54137 THEN 'max' END AS label
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE attendance IN (22616, 54137)
ORDER BY label DESC, date;
Results:
- min: date = "september 17", opponent = "giants", attendance = 22616
- max: date = "september 7", opponent = "dodgers", attendance = 54137

Conclusion:
- The computed difference between the highest and lowest attendance values is 31,521, which matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the attendance figures in the available table public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season. Dates are stored as text and presented as-is from the dataset.
