Task interpretation: Determine whether the Chinatrust Whales played against (and specifically a game involving) the player Kao Lung-Wei, using available structured data, and document evidence with executed SQL.

Data discovery
- Source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact".
- Available table: public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season.
- Schema (from inspection): columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), save (text). No keys/relationships defined.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify games vs. Chinatrust Whales
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Chinatrust Whale%';
Results:
- 3 / 22 — chinatrust whales — 7 - 9
- 3 / 23 — chinatrust whales — 4 - 5

2) Retrieve loss/save fields for those games (to see if "Kao Lung-Wei" appears)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save
FROM t_2007_uni_president_lions_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Chinatrust Whales%';
Results:
- date: 3 / 22, opponent: chinatrust whales, score: 7 - 9, loss: kao lung - wei, save: ni fu - deh
- date: 3 / 23, opponent: chinatrust whales, score: 4 - 5, loss: pan wei - lun, save: miguel saladin

3) Explicit check for presence of the strings "Kao" and flexible variants of "Lung-Wei"
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save,
       (date ILIKE '%kao%' OR opponent ILIKE '%kao%' OR score ILIKE '%kao%' OR loss ILIKE '%kao%' OR save ILIKE '%kao%') AS contains_kao,
       (
         date ILIKE '%lung-wei%' OR date ILIKE '%lung%wei%' OR date ILIKE '%lung - wei%' OR
         opponent ILIKE '%lung-wei%' OR opponent ILIKE '%lung%wei%' OR opponent ILIKE '%lung - wei%' OR
         score ILIKE '%lung-wei%' OR score ILIKE '%lung%wei%' OR score ILIKE '%lung - wei%' OR
         loss ILIKE '%lung-wei%' OR loss ILIKE '%lung%wei%' OR loss ILIKE '%lung - wei%' OR
         save ILIKE '%lung-wei%' OR save ILIKE '%lung%wei%' OR save ILIKE '%lung - wei%'
       ) AS contains_lung_wei
FROM t_2007_uni_president_lions_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Chinatrust Whales%';
Results (flags):
- 3 / 22 row: contains_kao = true, contains_lung_wei = true
- 3 / 23 row: contains_kao = false, contains_lung_wei = false

Findings
- The Uni-President Lions played the Chinatrust Whales on 3/22 and 3/23 (season context: 2007).
- For the 3/22 game vs. Chinatrust Whales, the "loss" field lists "kao lung - wei", indicating that Kao Lung-Wei was the losing pitcher in that game. This directly evidences a game in which Kao Lung-Wei played against the Chinatrust Whales.

Conclusion
- The claim that Chinatrust Whales played against Kao Lung-Wei is supported: there is at least one documented game (3/22) where Kao Lung-Wei is explicitly listed in the game outcome against the Whales.

Limitations
- The available data only covers the 2007 Uni-President Lions season and does not enumerate all seasons. There may be additional games in other years not represented here.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the request as asking whether there exists a game where the Chinatrust Whales faced a team featuring player Kao Lung-Wei, and whether Kao Lung-Wei participated. The presence of his name in the "loss" column is taken to indicate participation as the losing pitcher for the Lions on 3/22/2007.
- The string "kao lung - wei" corresponds to the player Kao Lung-Wei (name variants with hyphen/spacing).
