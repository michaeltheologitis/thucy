Claim to verify: "spiral galaxy have the most apparent magnitude"

How I interpret the claim:
- I treat "most apparent magnitude" as meaning "are the brightest (i.e., have the lowest numerical apparent magnitude values)" rather than the largest numerical magnitude (which would be faintest). Assumptions and limits are listed at the end.

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18), schema public
- Relevant table found: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 with columns: ngc number, object type, constellation, right ascension ( J2000 ), declination ( J2000 ), apparent magnitude

Step 1: Inspect available data and object types
Executed SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "constellation", "right ascension ( j2000 )", "declination ( j2000 )", "apparent magnitude" 
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
ORDER BY "ngc number" ASC
LIMIT 10;

Result (5 total rows exist in this table):
1) 5408 | irregular galaxy | centaurus | 14h03 m21.0s |  degree22′44″ | 14
2) 5457 | spiral galaxy    | ursa major | 14h03 m12.5s |  degree20′53″ | 8.7
3) 5466 | globular cluster | boötes     | 14h05 m27.4s |  degree32′04″ | 10.5
4) 5474 | spiral galaxy    | ursa major | 14h05 m01.5s |  degree39′45″ | 11.9
5) 5477 | irregular galaxy | ursa major | 14h05 m33.1s |  degree27′40″ | 14.5

Row count confirmation
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000;

Result:
- total_rows: 5

Step 2: Compare apparent magnitudes by galaxy type (only rows where object type contains "galaxy")
Executed SQL:
SELECT "object type",
       COUNT(*) AS count,
       MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_apparent_magnitude,
       MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_apparent_magnitude,
       AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_apparent_magnitude
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%galaxy%'
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY "object type";

Results:
- irregular galaxy: count = 2; min (brightest) = 14.0; max (faintest) = 14.5; avg = 14.25
- spiral galaxy:    count = 2; min (brightest) = 8.7;  max (faintest) = 11.9; avg = 10.30

Step 3: Identify the brightest galaxies in this table
Executed SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE lower("object type") LIKE '%galaxy%'
ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" ASC;

Results (lowest magnitude = brightest):
- 5457 | spiral galaxy    | 8.7
- 5474 | spiral galaxy    | 11.9
- 5408 | irregular galaxy | 14.0
- 5477 | irregular galaxy | 14.5

Findings
- Within the available dataset (NGC objects 5001–6000; 4 galaxy entries), the spiral galaxies present have lower (brighter) apparent magnitudes than the irregular galaxies present. The single brightest galaxy in this table is a spiral (NGC 5457, magnitude 8.7).

Conclusion
- Under the interpretation that “most apparent magnitude” means “brightest (lowest numerical magnitude),” the claim is supported by the available data in this specific table. However, this dataset is extremely small (only 4 galaxies in a narrow NGC range), so it does not justify a broad generalization about all galaxies.

Assumptions and limits
- Interpreted “most apparent magnitude” as “brightest (smallest magnitude).” If instead it meant “largest numerical magnitude” (faintest), the data here would contradict the claim: irregular galaxies in this table have the largest magnitude numbers (14.0–14.5), not spirals.
- Scope is limited to the single available table (NGC 5001–6000), which has only 5 total rows and 4 galaxy entries. No broader catalog was available via the connected data sources.
