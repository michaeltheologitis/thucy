Summary
The claim states that Vince Carter and Hakeem Olajuwon were the high rebounders in game 62 against Houston. I verified this by querying the 2001–02 Toronto Raptors season game log table.

Evidence from data
- Row for game 62 shows:
  - Date: march 5
  - Team: houston (opponent)
  - Score: l 109 - 112 (ot)
  - High rebounds: vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)
  - Location attendance: compaq center 14221

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT date, team, score, "high rebounds", "location attendance" FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE game = 62;

Conclusion
The data explicitly lists “vince carter , hakeem olajuwon (7)” as the high rebounders for game 62 versus Houston, confirming the claim.

Assumptions
- “game” is the game number in the season schedule.
- “team” represents the opponent for the Toronto Raptors in that game.
