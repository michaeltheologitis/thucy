Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact21 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_all_that_episodes (columns: season, series, episode title, original air date, nick prod)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count episode titles starting with the letter "t" (case-insensitive, ignoring leading spaces)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "episode title" IS NOT NULL
  AND lower(ltrim("episode title")) LIKE 't%';
Result: 3

2) List the matching episode titles
SQL executed:
SELECT "episode title"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "episode title" IS NOT NULL
  AND lower(ltrim("episode title")) LIKE 't%'
ORDER BY "episode title";
Results:
- tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j
- tony! toni! tone!
- tyra banks / blackstreet

Conclusion
- There are 3 episode titles that start with the letter "t" in the available dataset, not 1.

Assumptions
- "Start with the letter t" interpreted as case-insensitive match on the first non-space character of the title (implemented via lower(ltrim(title)) LIKE 't%').
