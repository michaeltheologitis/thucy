Claim interpreted: “Glasgow Govan is one of the four constituencies with result = ‘SNP gain’.” Data context: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 (Scottish Parliament General Election 2007).

Evidence from the database:
- Check which result values exist
  SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT result FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 ORDER BY result;
  Result values: con hold; lab hold; ld hold; snp gain

- Count constituencies with result = 'snp gain'
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE result = 'snp gain';
  Result: 4

- List constituencies with result = 'snp gain'
  SQL executed:
  SELECT constituency FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE result = 'snp gain' ORDER BY constituency;
  Result rows: dundee west; glasgow govan; kilmarnock & loudoun; western isles

Conclusion: Glasgow Govan is indeed one of four constituencies marked with result = ‘snp gain’ in this dataset.

Assumptions made:
