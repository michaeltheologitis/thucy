Summary:
- The value 20066 does occur multiple times in the available attendance data, but it is the maximum (not a “low”) attendance value in this dataset.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source with a public schema.
- Schema inspection identified one relevant table: public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season, with a single relevant column: attendance (bigint).

Findings grounded in data:
1) Does 20066 occur multiple times?
- Yes. It appears 7 times out of 14 rows.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_20066 FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE attendance = 20066;
  Result:
  count_20066 = 7

2) Is 20066 a low attendance value?
- No. It is the maximum attendance value in the table; the minimum is 17053.
  Executed SQL (minimum):
  SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
  Result:
  min_attendance = 17053
  Executed SQL (maximum):
  SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
  Result:
  max_attendance = 20066

3) Context: total rows and frequency of each attendance value.
- Total rows: 14
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
  Result:
  total_rows = 14
- Frequency by attendance value (descending by count, then value):
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT attendance, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  GROUP BY attendance
  ORDER BY count DESC, attendance DESC;
  Results:
  20066 — 7
  19019 — 1
  18532 — 1
  18118 — 1
  17565 — 1
  17361 — 1
  17174 — 1
  17053 — 1

Conclusion:
- The claim that “20066 occur multiple time” is supported.
- The description of 20066 as a “low attendance rate” is contradicted by the data; it is the maximum attendance observed in this dataset.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “attendance rate of 20066” as the raw attendance count value 20066 in the table public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season.
- Interpreted “occur multiple time” as appearing more than once in that table.
- No other attendance-related tables were found in the accessible data source.
