Claim interpreted: There exists at least one row where player = George Evans, total rebounds = 0, and rank > 8.

Data source discovery
- Database: postgres_tabfact9 (public schema)
- Table: public.my_info_table with columns: rank (bigint), player (text), years (text), games (bigint), "reb avg" (double precision), "total rebounds" (bigint)

Step 1: Identify any records for player George Evans
Executed SQL:
SELECT "rank", player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower(player) = lower('George Evans');

Result:
- rank: 4
- player: george evans
- years: 1997 - 2001
- games: 116
- reb avg: 8.2
- total rebounds: 953

Step 2: Test the specific claim (zero rebounds and rank > 8)
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(player) = 'george evans' AND "total rebounds" = 0 AND "rank" > 8;
Result: cnt = 0

Executed SQL (return matching rows, if any):
SELECT "rank", player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(player) = 'george evans' AND "total rebounds" = 0 AND "rank" > 8 ORDER BY "rank";
Result: no rows returned

Conclusion
- The database contains one record for George Evans with total rebounds = 953 and rank = 4. There are zero records where George Evans has total rebounds = 0 and rank > 8. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "zero rebound" was interpreted as "total rebounds = 0".
- Player matching was done as an exact, case-insensitive match on the full name "George Evans".
- "rank larger than 8" was interpreted as rank > 8.
