Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL instance: TabFact / postgres_tabfact33
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season

Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
  - Note: date is stored as text (e.g., "february 27"), with no year component.

Evidence
1) Inspect date format (sample rows)
   SQL:
   SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 10;
   Observation: dates are stored like "february 2", confirming we should query by month/day text.

2) Direct check for February 27 and February 29
   SQL:
   SELECT date, visitor, home, score
   FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
   WHERE date ILIKE 'february 27' OR date ILIKE 'february 29'
   ORDER BY date;
   Results:
   - february 27 — visitor: minnesota, home: tampa bay, score: 3 - 2
   - february 29 — visitor: minnesota, home: florida, score: 3 - 2

Conclusion
- Both February 27 and February 29 games ended with the same final score: 3 - 2. The claim is supported by the data in the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season table.

Assumptions
- The table t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season comprehensively represents the 2007–08 season, and the "february" entries pertain to February 2008 (the season spans 2007–08 and 2008 is a leap year).
- The date column’s text values uniquely identify the game dates within this season.
