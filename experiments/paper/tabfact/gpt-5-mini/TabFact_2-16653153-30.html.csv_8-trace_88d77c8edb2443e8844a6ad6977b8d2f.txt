- Interpreting the claim as referring to the 2008–09 NBL season (the season available in the data).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine the season-high winning percentage
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX("% won") AS max_pct_won FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season;
Result:
max_pct_won = 73.33

2) Identify the team(s) at that maximum and compare to Gold Coast Blaze
SQL executed:
SELECT team, "% won", lost
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE "% won" = (SELECT MAX("% won") FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season)
   OR lower(team) = 'gold coast blaze'
ORDER BY "% won" DESC;
Results (ordered by % won desc):
- south dragons | % won: 73.33 | lost: 8
- gold coast blaze | % won: 26.67 | lost: 22
