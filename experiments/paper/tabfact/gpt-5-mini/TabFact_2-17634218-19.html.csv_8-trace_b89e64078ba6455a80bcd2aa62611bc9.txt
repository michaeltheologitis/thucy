Claim to verify: “the first record be record after november 1965.”

Data discovery and schema context
- Available source: postgres_tabfact7 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
- Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text)
- Note: The first/last columns are stored as text in the form “Month YYYY”. I parsed them to dates for comparison.

Evidence
1) Inspect the rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, total, first, last, "highest rank" FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders LIMIT 50;

Key returned rows include:
- hasegawa — first: november 1965 — last: september 1974 — highest rank: sekiwake
- daikirin — first: november 1966 — last: september 1970 — highest rank: ōzeki
(plus 10 other rows with first ranging from 1969 to 2006)

2) Determine the earliest (“first”) date across the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT min(to_date(first, 'FMMonth YYYY')) AS min_parsed, max(to_date(first, 'FMMonth YYYY')) AS max_parsed FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;

Result:
- min_parsed: 1965-11-01
- max_parsed: 2006-07-01
Interpretation: The earliest “first” in the table is November 1965 (not later than November 1965).

3) Identify the earliest “first” strictly after November 1965 (for context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "first", to_date(initcap("first"), 'FMMonth YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE to_date(initcap("first"), 'FMMonth YYYY') > DATE '1965-11-01'
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC
LIMIT 1;

Result:
- name: daikirin — first: november 1966 — parsed_date: 1966-11-01
Interpretation: The first entry strictly after November 1965 is November 1966 (daikirin).

Conclusion
- The earliest “first” date in the dataset equals November 1965, not after it. Therefore, the claim that the first record is after November 1965 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “first record” as the earliest value in the column named “first” across all rows.
- “After November 1965” was taken to mean strictly later than 1965-11-01.
- The “first” column values were parsed as dates using format “Month YYYY”, with the day assumed to be the first of the month (e.g., “November 1965” -> 1965-11-01).
- If “after” was intended to include “on or after,” the statement would be true, since the earliest is exactly November 1965.
