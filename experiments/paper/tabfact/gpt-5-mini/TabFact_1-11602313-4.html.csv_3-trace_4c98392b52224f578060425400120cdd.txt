Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a table containing Intel Pentium Dual-Core processor specifications, including part numbers and FSB.
- Inspected the schema to locate relevant columns (part number(s), fsb).
- Queried the table for the exact part number (case- and space-insensitive) to retrieve the FSB value.

Data source discovery
- Source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors

Schema inspected
- Columns (subset): model number (text), sspec number (text), frequency (text), fsb (text), part number (s) (text)

Executed SQL (evidence)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "frequency", "fsb", "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE translate(lower("part number (s)"), ' ', '') = translate(lower('LF80537GE0251MN'), ' ', '');

Result:
- model number: pentium dual - core t2330
- sspec number: sla4k (m0)
- frequency: 1.6 ghz
- fsb: 533 mt / s
- part number (s): lf80537 ge0251 mn

Conclusion
- The processor with part number "lf80537 ge0251 mn" has an FSB of "533 mt / s" according to the data. The claim is supported.

Assumptions
- Part number matching was performed case-insensitively and ignoring spaces only, to align "lf80537 ge0251 mn" with "LF80537GE0251MN" in the database.
- The identified table is authoritative for Intel Pentium Dual-Core microprocessor specifications, including part numbers and FSB values.
