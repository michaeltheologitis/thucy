Claim to verify: “the team have be call the coquitlam adanacs throughout all 45 season since 1965.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact21 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: coquitlam_adanacs (columns: season [text], team name [text], games [bigint], losses [bigint], points [bigint])

Plan
1) Inspect the table and distinct values for season and team name.
2) Exclude aggregate/non-season rows and analyze numeric seasons only.
3) Confirm the count of numeric seasons and whether all are labeled “coquitlam adanacs.”
4) List any exceptions.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Preview and basic counts
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs LIMIT 10;
  Example rows include:
  [1] {season: "1965", team name: "coquitlam adanacs", ...}
  [4] {season: "1968", team name: "portland adanacs", ...}
  [10]{season: "1974", team name: "coquitlam adanacs", ...}

- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs;
  Result: {total_rows: 46}

- SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS distinct_seasons, MIN(season) AS min_season, MAX(season) AS max_season FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs;
  Result: {distinct_seasons: 46, min_season: "1965", max_season: "total"}
  Note: Presence of an aggregate row (season = "total").

- SQL: SELECT "team name", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs GROUP BY "team name" ORDER BY count DESC, "team name";
  Results:
  {team name: "coquitlam adanacs", count: 44}
  {team name: "45 seasons", count: 1}
  {team name: "portland adanacs", count: 1}

- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs WHERE season !~ '^[0-9]+$';
  Result: {season: "total", team name: "45 seasons", games: 1094, losses: 493, points: 1177}

2) Analyze numeric seasons only (exclude aggregate row)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT season FROM coquitlam_adanacs ORDER BY season;
  Distinct seasons: 1965, 1966, 1967, 1968, 1969, 1970, 1971, 1972, 1973, 1974, 1975, 1976, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, 1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, total

- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "team name" FROM coquitlam_adanacs;
  Distinct team names: portland adanacs, coquitlam adanacs, 45 seasons

- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS numeric_season_count FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]+$';
  Result: numeric_season_count = 45

- SQL: SELECT MIN(CAST(season AS INTEGER)) AS min_season, MAX(CAST(season AS INTEGER)) AS max_season FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]+$';
  Result: min_season = 1965, max_season = 2009

- SQL: SELECT "team name", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]+$' GROUP BY "team name" ORDER BY cnt DESC, "team name";
  Results among numeric seasons:
  coquitlam adanacs -> 44
  portland adanacs -> 1

- SQL: SELECT season, "team name", games, losses, points FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]+$' AND "team name" <> 'coquitlam adanacs' ORDER BY season;
  Result: season = 1968, team name = portland adanacs, games = 38, losses = 14, points = 48

Findings
- There are 45 numeric seasons from 1965 through 2009 inclusive.
- Of those 45 seasons, 44 list the team name as “coquitlam adanacs,” and 1 season (1968) lists “portland adanacs.”
- Therefore, it is not true that the team was called “coquitlam adanacs” throughout all 45 seasons since 1965.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: one of the 45 seasons (1968) has the team named “portland adanacs,” not “coquitlam adanacs.”

Assumptions
- I interpreted “throughout all 45 seasons since 1965” to refer to the 45 numeric season rows (1965–2009) in the table and excluded the aggregate summary row where season = "total."
