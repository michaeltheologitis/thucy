Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and their contents.
- Identified a relevant table (Utah Jazz all-time roster) that can verify the claim’s elements: player name, position, years with Jazz, and school.
- Queried the table for Jose/José Ortiz and reviewed the returned record.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: postgres_tabfact5 (TabFact), schema: public.
- Relevant table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster with columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team.

Evidence
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower(player) LIKE '%jos%' AND lower(player) LIKE '%ortiz%';

Query result (single row):
- player: josã ortiz
- nationality: puerto rico
- position: center
- years for jazz: 1988 - 90
- school / club team: oregon state

Assessment
- Position: center — matches the claim.
- Team/Context: The table is the Utah Jazz all-time roster; “school / club team” is Oregon State, indicating he came from Oregon State. The phrasing “Oregon State Jazz Club” appears to conflate school and team, but the data clearly links José Ortiz (listed as “josã ortiz”) to the Utah Jazz and Oregon State.
- Years: 1988–90 — matches the claim’s timeframe.

Conclusion
- The data directly supports that José Ortiz was listed as a center for the Utah Jazz from 1988–90 and that his school was Oregon State.

Assumptions
- “Oregon State Jazz Club” is interpreted as referring to the Utah Jazz (NBA) with the player’s school being Oregon State, rather than a literal club named “Oregon State Jazz Club.”
- The player name “josã ortiz” in the dataset is treated as an encoding variant of “José Ortiz.”
