Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single accessible table: public.uruguayan_air_force in the TabFact PostgreSQL instance.
- Inspected the table schema to locate relevant fields (notably the versions and in service columns).
- Queried the table for entries matching “SF-260EU”/“T-260 EU”.

Key evidence from the data:
- Matching row shows: aircraft: aermacchi sf260; versions: t - 260 eu; in service: 12.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%sf260%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%sf 260%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%t - 260%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%t-260%' OR versions ILIKE '%t - 260 eu%' OR versions ILIKE '%t-260 eu%' OR versions ILIKE '%260 eu%';

Findings:
- The dataset explicitly lists the Aermacchi SF-260 with version “t - 260 eu” and shows “in service” = 12. This directly supports the claim that there are 12 T-260 EU aircraft currently in service (as represented in this authoritative data source).

Assumptions:
- “t - 260 eu” in the claim refers to the “T-260 EU” variant entry under the Aermacchi SF-260 in the uruguayan_air_force table.
- “currently in service” is taken to mean the value in the table’s “in service” field for that variant.
