Scope and data sources explored
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact16), public schema.
- Relevant table: nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
  - Columns: date, visiting team, final score, host team, stadium
  - Coverage: NBC Sunday Night Football results from 2006 to present.

Key checks performed
1) Identify the exact stadium naming in the data
- Purpose: Ensure correct filtering by stadium name.
- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT stadium FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Giant%' ORDER BY stadium;
- Result: giants stadium

2) Were the Chicago Bears the visiting team at Giants Stadium on SNF, and what was the final score?
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", "final score", stadium
FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE lower("visiting team") = 'chicago bears'
  AND lower(stadium) = 'giants stadium'
ORDER BY date;
- Result (single row):
  - Date: november 12
  - Visiting team: chicago bears
  - Host team: new york giants
  - Final score: 38 - 20
  - Stadium: giants stadium
- Finding: The only SNF Bears-at-Giants game at Giants Stadium has final score 38 - 20, not 26 - 21.

3) Was there any SNF game at Giants Stadium with a final score of 26 - 21 (regardless of teams)?
- SQL executed:
SELECT "date", "visiting team", "host team", "final score", "stadium" 
FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE lower(trim("stadium")) = 'giants stadium'
  AND trim("final score") = '26 - 21';
- Result (single row):
  - Date: september 10
  - Visiting team: indianapolis colts
  - Host team: new york giants
  - Final score: 26 - 21
  - Stadium: giants stadium
- Finding: A 26 - 21 score did occur at Giants Stadium on SNF, but with the Indianapolis Colts as the visiting team, not the Chicago Bears.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the final score for the game at Giants Stadium when the Chicago Bears were the visiting team was 26 - 21” is contradicted by the data in the Sunday Night Football results table. The relevant Bears-at-Giants SNF game at Giants Stadium finished 38 - 20. The 26 - 21 score at Giants Stadium corresponds to Colts at Giants, not Bears at Giants.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Data source covers NBC Sunday Night Football games from 2006–present only. If the claim refers to a non-SNF game or a season outside this range, it would be outside the available dataset. Within this dataset, the claim is inaccurate.
