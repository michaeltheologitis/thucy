Claim: “gene borek from new zealand be tie for 3rd place.”

Finding: Inaccurate. The data show that Gene Borek is from the United States and tied for 6th (t6). The player from New Zealand who tied for 3rd (t3) is Bob Charles.

Evidence
1) Full table contents for context
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf;
Results (excerpt):
- place: t3, player: bob charles, country: new zealand, score: 71 + 69 = 140, to par: - 2
- place: t6, player: gene borek, country: united states, score: 77 + 65 = 142, to par: e

2) Gene Borek’s specific row
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, country, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Borek%';
Result:
- place: t6; country: united states; player: gene borek; score: 77 + 65 = 142; to par: e

3) All players tied for 3rd (t3)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country, place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(place) LIKE '%t3%';
Results:
- Jack Nicklaus — united states — t3
- Johnny Miller — united states — t3
- Bob Charles — new zealand — t3

4) Players from New Zealand
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE country ILIKE '%new zealand%' ORDER BY player;
Result:
- bob charles

Conclusion
- Gene Borek did not tie for 3rd; he tied for 6th.
- Gene Borek is not from New Zealand; he is listed as from the United States.
- The New Zealand player who tied for 3rd is Bob Charles.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the results in the available dataset “t_1973_u_s_open_golf,” which lists placements, players, and countries for that event.
- The phrasing “be tie for 3rd place” was taken to mean “tied for 3rd place.”
