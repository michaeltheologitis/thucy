Claim to verify: "the wildcat never score more than 7 point in any game they win"

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL data source (TabFact) with a public schema. The relevant table available is: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

Schema overview (from inspection)
- Table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "wildcats points" (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect all rows (to understand the season results and how wins/losses and points are recorded)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Returned rows (extract):
- game 2 (sept 27) vs cincinnati — result: win — wildcats points: 20 — opponents: 0
- game 3 (oct 4) vs xavier — result: win — wildcats points: 20 — opponents: 7
- game 4 (oct 11) vs 9 georgia — result: win — wildcats points: 26 — opponents: 0
- game 5 (oct 18) vs 10 vanderbilt — result: win — wildcats points: 14 — opponents: 0
- game 6 (oct 25) vs michigan state — result: win — wildcats points: 7 — opponents: 6
- game 8 (nov 8) vs west virginia — result: win — wildcats points: 15 — opponents: 6
- game 9 (nov 15) vs evansville — result: win — wildcats points: 36 — opponents: 0
(Complete season table contained 10 games; 7 wins total.)

2) Count wins with more than 7 points
Executed SQL (list and count):
- Listing query:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "wildcats points" FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE "wildcats points" > 7 AND result ILIKE 'W%';
Returned:
  game 2 — sept 27 — cincinnati — win — 20
  game 3 — oct 4 — xavier — win — 20
  game 4 — oct 11 — 9 georgia — win — 26
  game 5 — oct 18 — 10 vanderbilt — win — 14
  game 8 — nov 8 — west virginia — win — 15
  game 9 — nov 15 — evansville — win — 36
- Count query:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_over_7 FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE "wildcats points" > 7 AND result ILIKE 'W%';
Result:
  wins_over_7 = 6

3) Total number of wins (for context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE result = 'win';
Result:
  wins = 7

Assessment
- The team had 7 total wins.
- In 6 of those wins, the Wildcats scored more than 7 points (20, 20, 26, 14, 15, 36). Therefore, the statement that they never scored more than 7 points in any game they won is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team; it is false in this dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the wildcat" to refer to the only accessible relevant dataset: the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team, because this is the sole table available in the connected data source. Wins are determined by result = 'win' in the table’s result column.
