Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible source: TabFact (PostgreSQL, public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification with columns: date (text), score (text), set 1 (text), set 2 (text), set 3 (text), total (text).

Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as: In this table, whenever the value of column "set 3" is "18 - 25", the corresponding value in column "total" is "53 - 75".

Evidence from the data
1) Verify that the value "18 - 25" exists in column "set 3".
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "set 3" FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification WHERE "set 3" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "set 3";
Result excerpt includes: 18 - 25

2) Retrieve the row(s) where "set 3" = '18 - 25' and check "total".
SQL executed:
SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE "set 3" = '18 - 25';
Result:
- date: 15 jul; score: 0 - 3; set 1: 16 - 25; set 2: 19 - 25; set 3: 18 - 25; total: 53 - 75

Finding
- For the row where set 3 is "18 - 25", the total is indeed "53 - 75". No contradictory rows were returned.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the table t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification in the TabFact public schema.
- Exact string match was used for "18 - 25" (including spaces around the hyphen).
