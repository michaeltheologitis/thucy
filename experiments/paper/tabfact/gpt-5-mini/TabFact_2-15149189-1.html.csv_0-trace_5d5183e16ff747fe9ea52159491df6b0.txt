Claim: “Danny Cipriani, born November 2, 1987, is a fly-half.”

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table identified: public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads (columns include player, position, date of birth (age), caps, club / province)

Evidence gathered:
1) Player record lookup
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "date of birth (age)" FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads WHERE player ILIKE '%danny cipriani%';
- Result:
  {"player":"danny cipriani","position":"fly - half","date of birth (age)":"2 november 1987"}

Assessment:
- Date of birth: “2 november 1987” (day–month–year) matches the claim “November 2, 1987” (month–day–year). Supported.
- Position: “fly - half” matches “fly-half.” Supported.

Conclusion: Both elements of the claim are directly supported by the queried data from the 2008 Six Nations squads table.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “fly - half” as the standard rugby union position “fly-half.”
- Interpreted date formatting differences (day–month–year vs. month–day–year) as equivalent representations of the same date.
