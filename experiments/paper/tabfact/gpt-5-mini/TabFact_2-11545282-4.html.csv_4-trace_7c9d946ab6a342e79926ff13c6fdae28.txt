Claim interpreted: The Utah Jazz had at least three guards on their 1979–80 team.

Data sources explored
- Discovered one PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact22) with one relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster, containing player, position, and years for jazz (free-text) among other fields.

Method
- Filtered the all-time roster for players whose “years for jazz” text indicates presence in 1979–80 and whose position includes the substring “guard”.

Evidence
1) List players matching season and position criteria
SQL executed:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE position ILIKE '%guard%'
AND (
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979-80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979–80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%79-80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%79–80%'
);

Result rows:
- adrian dantley — guard - forward — 1979 - 86
- brad davis — guard — 1979 - 80
- paul dawkins — guard — 1979 - 80
- greg deane — guard — 1979 - 80

2) Count such players
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE position ILIKE '%guard%'
AND (
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979-80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979–80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%79-80%' OR
  "years for jazz" ILIKE '%79–80%'
);

Result:
- count: 4

Conclusion
- The roster data shows at least three guards for the 1979–80 Jazz (Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, Greg Deane). Even without counting Adrian Dantley (listed as guard-forward), the threshold of three guards is met. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Treated any “years for jazz” entry that includes 1979 (e.g., “1979 - 86”) as including the 1979–80 season.
- Considered any position containing the substring “guard” (including combo positions like “guard - forward”) as a guard for counting purposes.
