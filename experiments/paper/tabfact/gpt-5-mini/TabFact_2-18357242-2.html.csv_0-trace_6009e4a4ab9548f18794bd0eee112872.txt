Scope and dataset checked
- Available data source: TabFact (public schema) with one table: public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix (columns: driver, team, laps, "time / retired", grid, points).

Evidence 1 — Identify exact stored driver names
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT driver FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix WHERE driver ILIKE '%Ryan%' OR driver ILIKE '%Vasser%';
Results:
- "jimmy vasser"
- "ryan hunter - reay"

Evidence 2 — Retrieve records for the two drivers
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, team, points, grid FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix WHERE driver IN ('jimmy vasser', 'ryan hunter - reay');
Results:
- driver: ryan hunter - reay | team: american spirit team johansson | points: 1 | grid: 9
- driver: jimmy vasser | team: american spirit team johansson | points: 0 | grid: 16

Evidence 3 — Verify all conditions simultaneously
SQL executed (list matching rows):
SELECT driver, team, laps, "time / retired", grid, points
FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix
WHERE driver IN ('ryan hunter - reay','jimmy vasser')
  AND points < 2
  AND grid > 4
  AND team = 'american spirit team johansson';
Result rows:
- ryan hunter - reay | american spirit team johansson | laps: 83 | time / retired: + 2 laps | grid: 9 | points: 1
- jimmy vasser | american spirit team johansson | laps: 83 | time / retired: + 2 laps | grid: 16 | points: 0

SQL executed (count matching rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS matching_count
FROM public.t_2003_tecate_telmex_monterrey_grand_prix
WHERE driver IN ('ryan hunter - reay','jimmy vasser')
  AND points < 2
  AND grid > 4
  AND team = 'american spirit team johansson';
Result:
- matching_count: 2

Conclusion
- For both Ryan Hunter-Reay and Jimmy Vasser in this dataset: points are fewer than 2 (1 and 0), grid positions are larger than 4 (9 and 16), and both are listed with team "american spirit team johansson". The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available table for the 2003 Tecate Telmex Monterrey Grand Prix. "Points" refers to the points column in this table; "grid larger than 4" refers to the grid column; and the team is matched exactly as stored: "american spirit team johansson".
