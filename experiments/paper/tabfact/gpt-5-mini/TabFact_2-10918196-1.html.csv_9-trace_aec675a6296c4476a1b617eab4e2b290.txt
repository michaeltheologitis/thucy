Claim to verify: “the new york jet have 992 more crowd attendance in their second game against the new england patriot then from their first game play against them during the 1993 season.”

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1993_new_york_jets_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), game site (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence gathered:
1) Identify Jets vs. Patriots games and attendances (ordered by week):
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Patriots%'
ORDER BY week;

Result:
- Week 4 | Date: 1993 - 09 - 26 | Opponent: new england patriots | Game site: the meadowlands | Attendance: 64836
- Week 13 | Date: 1993 - 11 - 28 | Opponent: new england patriots | Game site: foxboro stadium | Attendance: 42810

2) Compute attendance difference (second minus first):
Executed SQL:
WITH pats AS (
  SELECT week, attendance, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY week) rn
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Patriots%'
)
SELECT
  (SELECT week FROM pats WHERE rn=1) AS first_week,
  (SELECT attendance FROM pats WHERE rn=1) AS first_attendance,
  (SELECT week FROM pats WHERE rn=2) AS second_week,
  (SELECT attendance FROM pats WHERE rn=2) AS second_attendance,
  ((SELECT attendance FROM pats WHERE rn=2) - (SELECT attendance FROM pats WHERE rn=1)) AS diff;

Result:
- first_week: 4
- first_attendance: 64836
- second_week: 13
- second_attendance: 42810
- diff (second - first): -22026

Assessment:
- The second game’s attendance (42,810) was 22,026 fewer than the first game’s attendance (64,836), not 992 more.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “First” vs “second” game refers to chronological order by week in the 1993 season (Week 4 first, Week 13 second).
- “Crowd attendance” corresponds to the attendance column in the table.
- Opponent matching used a case-insensitive substring match (opponent ILIKE '%Patriots%').
