Summary
The available data includes a table of the Guildford Flames’ 2008–09 season fixtures/results. Querying this table shows an away match versus Wightlink Raiders with a recorded result of “lost 5 - 4,” which supports the claim.

Data source discovery
- Accessible source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact/Postgres connection). Public schema contains a table relevant to fixtures/results: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season.
- Table columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (text), competition (text), man of the match (text).

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Locate any matches vs Wightlink (case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, competition
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%wightlink%';
Result:
- date: 22nd | opponent: wightlink raiders | venue: away | result: lost 5 - 4 | competition: league / cup

2) Confirm opponent and away venue explicitly:
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Wightlink%' AND venue = 'away';
Result:
- date: 22nd | opponent: wightlink raiders | venue: away | result: lost 5 - 4

Assessment
- The data shows an away match versus Wightlink Raiders with a result recorded as “lost 5 - 4,” matching the claim. Minor naming difference (“raider” vs “raiders”) is non-substantive.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Guildford Flames’ 2008–09 season data available in the database.
- Opponent name matching is case-insensitive and accepts pluralization differences (raider vs raiders).
