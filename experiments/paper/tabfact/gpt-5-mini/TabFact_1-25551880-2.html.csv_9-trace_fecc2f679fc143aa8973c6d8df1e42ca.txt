- Result: Only one relevant cycling table is available in the accessible TabFact database: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a.

Schema evidence
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Output:
  Database: TabFact; Schema: public; Tables:
  - t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a — (no further description in schema)

Evidence from data
1) List all stages and winners in the 2010 Vuelta a España
- SQL executed:
  SELECT stage, winner
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  ORDER BY stage;
- Result (stage — winner):
  1 — team htc - columbia
  2 — yauheni hutarovich
  3 — philippe gilbert
  4 — igor antón
  5 — tyler farrar
  6 — thor hushovd
  7 — alessandro petacchi
  8 — david moncoutié
  9 — david lópez
  10 — imanol erviti
  11 — igor antón
  12 — mark cavendish
  13 — mark cavendish
  14 — joaquim rodríguez
  15 — carlos barredo
  16 — mikel nieve
  17 — peter velits
  18 — mark cavendish
  19 — philippe gilbert
  20 — ezequiel mosquera 2
  21 — tyler farrar

2) Compute sequences of consecutive stages won by the same rider; identify any such sequence for Mark Cavendish of length ≥ 5
- SQL executed:
  WITH ordered AS (
   SELECT stage, winner,
    CASE WHEN winner = lag(winner) OVER (ORDER BY stage) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS is_new
   FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  ),
  groups AS (
   SELECT stage, winner,
    sum(is_new) OVER (ORDER BY stage) AS grp
   FROM ordered
  )
  SELECT grp, min(stage) AS start_stage, max(stage) AS end_stage, (max(stage)-min(stage)+1) AS length, winner,
         string_agg(stage::text, ',' ORDER BY stage) AS stages
  FROM groups
  GROUP BY grp, winner
  ORDER BY start_stage;
- Result (grp, start_stage, end_stage, length, winner, stages):
  1, 1, 1, 1, team htc - columbia, 1
  2, 2, 2, 1, yauheni hutarovich, 2
  3, 3, 3, 1, philippe gilbert, 3
  4, 4, 4, 1, igor antón, 4
  5, 5, 5, 1, tyler farrar, 5
  6, 6, 6, 1, thor hushovd, 6
  7, 7, 7, 1, alessandro petacchi, 7
  8, 8, 8, 1, david moncoutié, 8
  9, 9, 9, 1, david lópez, 9
  10, 10, 10, 1, imanol erviti, 10
  11, 11, 11, 1, igor antón, 11
  12, 12, 13, 2, mark cavendish, 12,13
  13, 14, 14, 1, joaquim rodríguez, 14
  14, 15, 15, 1, carlos barredo, 15
  15, 16, 16, 1, mikel nieve, 16
  16, 17, 17, 1, peter velits, 17
  17, 18, 18, 1, mark cavendish, 18
  18, 19, 19, 1, philippe gilbert, 19
  19, 20, 20, 1, ezequiel mosquera 2, 20
  20, 21, 21, 1, tyler farrar, 21
- Interpretation: In this dataset (2010 Vuelta), Mark Cavendish has a maximum streak of 2 consecutive stage wins (stages 12–13). No longer streaks exist for any rider.

3) Explicit check for a Cavendish streak ≥ 5
- SQL executed:
  WITH ordered AS (
   SELECT stage, winner,
    CASE WHEN winner = lag(winner) OVER (ORDER BY stage) THEN 0 ELSE 1 END AS is_new
   FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  ),
  groups AS (
   SELECT stage, winner,
    sum(is_new) OVER (ORDER BY stage) AS grp
   FROM ordered
  ),
  seqs AS (
   SELECT grp, min(stage) AS start_stage, max(stage) AS end_stage, (max(stage)-min(stage)+1) AS length, winner,
         string_agg(stage::text, ',' ORDER BY stage) AS stages
   FROM groups
   GROUP BY grp, winner
  )
  SELECT * FROM seqs
  WHERE winner = 'mark cavendish' AND length >= 5
  ORDER BY start_stage;
- Result: no rows returned.

Conclusion
- Based on the only accessible cycling data (2010 Vuelta a España), Mark Cavendish did not win 5 consecutive stages; his longest consecutive streak in this dataset is 2 stages (12–13). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions and scope
- The available database exposes only the 2010 Vuelta a España stage-winner table. If the claim refers to a different race or year, it cannot be verified here. My conclusion is strictly limited to the accessible data and does not generalize beyond it.
