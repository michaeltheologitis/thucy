Claim to verify:
- "the 5th volume be release in region 1 on september 19 , 2006 , there be 4 episode"

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact22 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table (columns: volume, discs, episodes, region 1, region 2, region 4)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the record for volume 5
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE volume = 5;
- Result (single row):
  - volume: 5
  - discs: 1
  - episodes: 4
  - region 1: september 19 , 2006
  - region 2: may 26 , 2008
  - region 4: march 5 , 2009

2) Confirm uniqueness of volume 5 entry
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_volume_5 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE volume = 5;
- Result: count_volume_5 = 1

Assessment:
- The record for volume 5 lists the Region 1 release date as "september 19 , 2006" and the number of episodes as 4. This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "5th volume" maps to the row where volume = 5 in public.my_info_table.
- "release in region 1" refers to the value stored in the "region 1" text column representing the release date for DVD Region 1.
