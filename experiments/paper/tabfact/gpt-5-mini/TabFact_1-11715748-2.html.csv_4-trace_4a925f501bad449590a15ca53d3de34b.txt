Claim being checked: “Funhouse be directed by Al Katz and written by Gilbert Adler.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact, schema: public)
- Relevant table identified: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes (episodes of “Freddy’s Nightmares” with title, director(s), writer(s), airdate)

Evidence gathered
1) Attempt exact, case-sensitive title match
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, title, "director (s)", "writer (s)" FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE title = 'Funhouse';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Attempt case-insensitive search for titles containing “funhouse”
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, series, title, "director (s)", "writer (s)" FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE title ILIKE '%funhouse%';
Result (single row):
- season: 17
- series: 39
- title: funhouse
- director (s): gilbert adler
- writer (s): al katz and gilbert adler

Findings
- The only matching entry titled “funhouse” lists Gilbert Adler as the director and credits both Al Katz and Gilbert Adler as writers.
- Therefore:
  - “Directed by Al Katz” is contradicted by the data (director is Gilbert Adler).
  - “Written by Gilbert Adler” is partially correct but incomplete; writing credit is shared with Al Katz.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes one false element (director) with a partial truth (writer credit incomplete). This results in a partly inaccurate overall statement.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “Funhouse” as the title of an entry in the available dataset and applied a case-insensitive match since exact case-sensitive match returned no rows.
- Treated the “director (s)” and “writer (s)” fields as authoritative credit information for the episode.
