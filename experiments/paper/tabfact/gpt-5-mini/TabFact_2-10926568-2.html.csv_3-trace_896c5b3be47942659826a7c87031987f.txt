Claim: “episode number 213 air on january 28 , 2008.”

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. Episode number 213 aired on May 5, 2008. The episode that aired on January 28, 2008 is episode number 201.

Evidence from the database (TabFact → public.cities_of_the_underworld):

1) Verify episode number 213
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld WHERE "episode no" = 213;
- Result:
  - episode no: 213
  - episode title: secret soviet bases
  - host: don wildman
  - original airdate: may 5 , 2008
  - production no: 27

2) Identify the episode that aired on January 28, 2008 (exact match)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "episode no", "episode title" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld WHERE "original airdate" = 'january 28 , 2008';
- Result:
  - episode no: 201, episode title: underground apocalypse

(Additional exploratory check for January 2008 entries)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "episode no","episode title","original airdate" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld WHERE "original airdate" ILIKE '%January%' AND "original airdate" ILIKE '%2008%';
- Result included: episode no 201 — underground apocalypse — january 28 , 2008

Assessment:
- Episode 213’s original airdate is may 5 , 2008, not january 28 , 2008.
- The january 28 , 2008 airdate corresponds to episode 201, not 213.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the dataset available (the TV series “Cities of the Underworld”) and “episode number 213” maps to the "episode no" field in public.cities_of_the_underworld.
- “Air” refers to the "original airdate" column, which stores dates in lowercase textual format with spacing as shown (e.g., “january 28 , 2008”).
