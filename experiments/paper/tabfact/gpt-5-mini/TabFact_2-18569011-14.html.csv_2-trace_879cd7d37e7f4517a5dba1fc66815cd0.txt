Conclusion: The claim that athlete Visa Hongisto (Finland) was in lane number 9 is contradicted by the available data; the record shows he was in lane 3.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres (columns: lane, athlete, nationality, time, react)

Evidence from data:
- One record matches the athlete name containing “Hongisto”. It lists:
  - athlete: visa hongisto
  - nationality: finland
  - lane: 3
  - time: 20.76
  - react: 0.124

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT athlete, nationality, lane, time, react
FROM public.athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Hongisto%';

Result returned (single row):
- athlete: visa hongisto | nationality: finland | lane: 3 | time: 20.76 | react: 0.124

Assessment: The data shows Visa Hongisto’s lane as 3, not 9. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the men’s 200 metres at the 2008 Summer Olympics (the event represented by the available table).
- The dataset does not include separate heat/round identifiers; we assume the lane value shown corresponds to his recorded race in this event within this dataset.
