Claim interpreted: “The score of the game with a 12 - 38 - 13 record is 2 - 6.”

Data discovery and schema grounding:
- Discovered data source: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact/postgres_tabfact31) with a public schema.
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Locate the row(s) whose record equals 12-38-13 (ignoring spaces and en-dash vs hyphen) and view the score.
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
     FROM public.my_info_table
     WHERE replace(regexp_replace(record, E'\\s', '', 'g'), '–', '-') = '12-38-13';
   - Result:
     - date: february 26; visitor: new jersey; score: 4 - 5; home: pittsburgh; record: 12 - 38 - 13

2) Test explicitly whether any row with record = 12-38-13 (normalized) has score = 2-6 (normalized).
   - Executed SQL (count):
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
     FROM public.my_info_table
     WHERE replace(replace(replace(record, ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '') = replace(replace(replace('12-38-13', ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '')
       AND replace(replace(replace(score, ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '') = replace(replace(replace('2-6', ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '');
   - Result: match_count = 0

   - Executed SQL (return rows if any):
     SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record
     FROM public.my_info_table
     WHERE replace(replace(replace(record, ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '') = replace(replace(replace('12-38-13', ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '')
       AND replace(replace(replace(score, ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '') = replace(replace(replace('2-6', ' ', ''), '–', ''), '-', '')
     ORDER BY date;
   - Result: no rows returned

Assessment:
- The only game in the dataset with record 12 - 38 - 13 has a score of 4 - 5, not 2 - 6.
- No row exists where the record is 12-38-13 and the score is 2-6 (even after normalization to handle spacing/dash variants).

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data in the available database.

Assumptions made:
- “Game with a 12 - 38 - 13 record” refers to the row(s) in public.my_info_table whose record field equals 12-38-13 after normalizing spaces and dash characters.
- “Score be 2 - 6” refers to the value of the score column for that game, normalized similarly for spaces and dashes.
- If multiple rows had matched the record, all would have been examined; only one such row was found.
