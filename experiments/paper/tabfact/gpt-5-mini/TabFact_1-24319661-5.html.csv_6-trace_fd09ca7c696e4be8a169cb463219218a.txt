Claim to verify: “episode number 10 of the season have bcw410 as a production code and an air date of september 11 , 2012.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (public schema). It contains a table with White Collar episode details: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes, including columns for episode title, episode number in season, production code, and original air date.

Evidence 1 — Check the episode with production code BCW410
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "title","no in season","no in series","production code","original air date"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE lower("production code") = lower('BCW410');
- Result:
  - title: Vested Interest
  - no in season: 10
  - no in series: 56
  - production code: bcw410
  - original air date: september 18 , 2012
- Interpretation:
  - The production code bcw410 corresponds to episode number 10 in its season, titled “Vested Interest.” However, its original air date is september 18 , 2012, not september 11 , 2012.

Evidence 2 — Check which episode aired on September 11, 2012
- Exploratory SQL (to confirm date formatting and nearby entries):
SELECT "title", "no in season", "production code", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%2012%'
LIMIT 50;
- Relevant results included:
  - ...
  - ancient history — no in season: 8 — bcw408 — september 4 , 2012
  - gloves off — no in season: 9 — bcw409 — september 11 , 2012
  - vested interest — no in season: 10 — bcw410 — september 18 , 2012
- Exact-match SQL for the date:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "production code", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE "original air date" = 'september 11 , 2012';
- Result:
  - title: gloves off
  - no in season: 9
  - production code: bcw409
  - original air date: september 11 , 2012
- Interpretation:
  - September 11, 2012 corresponds to episode 9 (“Gloves Off”), production code bcw409—not episode 10.

Conclusion
- True: Episode number 10 has production code bcw410.
- False: Its air date is not September 11, 2012; it is September 18, 2012. September 11, 2012 belongs to episode 9, production code bcw409.

Assumptions
- The claim did not specify the TV series. I inferred the series is “White Collar” based on the production code format (BCW410) and the available database table named list_of_white_collar_episodes. All verification is grounded in that table’s data.
