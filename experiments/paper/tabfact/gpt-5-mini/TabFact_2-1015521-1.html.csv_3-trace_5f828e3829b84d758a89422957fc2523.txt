Claim: “there be 3 c - 95 brazilian aircraft currently in service.”

Data source explored: TabFact PostgreSQL (postgres_tabfact22), table public.uruguayan_air_force.

What I looked for: Entries indicating the C-95 variant, its origin (Brazil), and the count “in service.”

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Schema exploration (discover relevant aircraft entries)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT aircraft FROM public.uruguayan_air_force ORDER BY aircraft;
Relevant result excerpt:
{"aircraft":"embraer emb 110 bandeirante"}

2) Identify rows related to the C-95 variant via the aircraft name/variant
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, origin, type, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%emb 110%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%bandeirante%';
Result:
{"aircraft":"embraer emb 110 bandeirante","in service":"3","origin":"brazil","type":"transport / utility","versions":"c - 95"}

3) Directly confirm entries where the version is exactly “c - 95”
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, origin, type, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE versions = 'c - 95';
Result:
- aircraft: embraer emb 110 bandeirante
- origin: brazil
- type: transport / utility
- versions: c - 95
- in service: 3

Conclusion: The dataset shows that the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante (origin: Brazil) with version “c - 95” has an “in service” value of 3. This supports the claim that there are 3 C-95 Brazilian aircraft currently in service (in the context of the Uruguayan Air Force data in this source).

Assumptions made:
- “currently in service” refers to the “in service” field in the public.uruguayan_air_force table, representing the Uruguayan Air Force’s status.
- “c - 95 brazilian aircraft” is interpreted as the C-95 variant (version) of the Brazilian-origin Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante listed in the table.
