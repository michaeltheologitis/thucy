Claim to verify: “the asian record be make by saif saaeed shaheen in july 14 2006.”

Summary of findings:
- The available data shows Saif Saaeed Shaheen holds the Asian record with a time of 7:53.63 in Brussels, Belgium on 3 September 2004 (not 14 July 2006).
- The date 14 July 2006 in this dataset corresponds to the North American record by Daniel Lincoln in Rome, Italy.

Evidence from the database (TabFact):
1) Full table inspection
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table;
Key relevant rows returned:
- Row labeled “asian record”: athlete = “saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )”, time = “7:53.63”, location = “brussels , belgium”, date = “3 september 2004”.
- Row with date “14 july 2006”: record_type = “north american record”, athlete = “daniel lincoln ( usa )”, time = “8:08.82”, location = “rome , italy”.

2) Direct lookup of the Asian record row
Executed SQL:
SELECT "world record", "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )", "7:53.63", "brussels , belgium", "3 september 2004"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "world record" = 'asian record';
Result:
- world record: asian record
- saif saaeed shaheen ( qat ): saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )
- 7:53.63: 7:53.63
- brussels , belgium: brussels , belgium
- 3 september 2004: 3 september 2004

3) Direct lookup of the 14 July 2006 row
Executed SQL:
SELECT "world record" AS record_type, "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )" AS athlete, "7:53.63" AS time, "brussels , belgium" AS location
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "3 september 2004" = '14 july 2006';
Result:
- record_type: north american record
- athlete: daniel lincoln ( usa )
- time: 8:08.82
- location: rome , italy

Conclusion:
- The data contradicts the claim. Saif Saaeed Shaheen’s Asian record (7:53.63) was set on 3 September 2004 in Brussels, Belgium. The date 14 July 2006 corresponds to Daniel Lincoln’s North American record in Rome, Italy.

Assumptions made:
- The table “my_info_table” pertains to 3000 m steeplechase records, given the times/locations shown and known context. The phrase “be make” is interpreted as “was made/was set.”
