Interpretation of the claim: “the number 2 be the only erp w” is taken to mean: In the table at hand, the only value present in the column "erp w" is 2.

Data source discovery and schema context:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.whlp
- Columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (double precision), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Distinct values present in "erp w":
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "erp w" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "erp w" ASC;
Result rows:
{"erp w": 2}
{"erp w": 10}
{"erp w": 19}
{"erp w": 38}
{"erp w": 80}

2) Count of distinct (non-null) values in "erp w":
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "erp w") FROM public.whlp WHERE "erp w" IS NOT NULL;
Result:
{"count": 5}

3) Frequency distribution of "erp w" values:
SQL:
SELECT "erp w", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.whlp GROUP BY "erp w" ORDER BY "erp w" ASC;
Results:
- erp w = 2 : 1
- erp w = 10 : 2
- erp w = 19 : 1
- erp w = 38 : 1
- erp w = 80 : 1

Conclusion:
The column "erp w" contains multiple distinct values (2, 10, 19, 38, 80). Therefore, 2 is not the only value in "erp w". The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the public.whlp table’s "erp w" column in the discovered TabFact database and asserts that 2 is the sole value appearing in that column. Nulls (if present) are excluded when listing distinct numeric values, consistent with the queries above.
