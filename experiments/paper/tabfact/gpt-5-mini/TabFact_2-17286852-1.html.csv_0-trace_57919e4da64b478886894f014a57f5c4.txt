What I checked
- Claim: “In Stanley, the bridge is of the concrete deck girder style.”
- I searched the available authoritative data source (postgres_tabfact2, public schema) for bridge-related records associated with “Stanley.”

Data source overview
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema)
- Table used: my_info_table(name text, listed text, location text, county text, type text)

Executed queries and results
1) Target bridges explicitly named as such in Stanley
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, location, county, type FROM my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%bridge%' AND location ILIKE '%stanley%' ORDER BY name;
Result:
- No rows returned.

2) Broadened search to any records whose name or location mentions “Stanley”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, location, county, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%stanley%' OR location ILIKE '%stanley%';
Result:
- name: great northern railway underpass
  location: stanley
  county: mountrail
  type: concrete deck girder bridge

Interpretation
- The record located in “Stanley” (county: Mountrail) has type explicitly listed as “concrete deck girder bridge.” This directly supports the claim that the bridge in Stanley is of the concrete deck girder style.

Conclusion
- The data shows a bridge-related structure in Stanley with type “concrete deck girder bridge,” which matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “Stanley” refers to the entry with location = “stanley” in the dataset (which aligns with Stanley in Mountrail County).
- “The bridge” is interpreted as the relevant bridge structure recorded for Stanley in the dataset, namely the “great northern railway underpass,” whose type indicates its structural style.
- “Style” is treated as equivalent to the “type” field in the data.
