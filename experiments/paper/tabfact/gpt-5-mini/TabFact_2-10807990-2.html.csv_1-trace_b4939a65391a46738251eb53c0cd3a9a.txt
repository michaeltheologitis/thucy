Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with table: t_1942_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date"

Evidence from data:
- I queried the 1942 VFL season table for matches where Essendon was the away team and the venue was Yarraville Oval. The data shows one such match.
- Match details returned by the query:
  - Date: 16 may 1942
  - Home team: footscray
  - Away team: essendon
  - Venue: yarraville oval
  - Home team score: 12.16 (88)
  - Away team score: 14.8 (92)

Executed SQL (that produced the evidence):
SELECT "home team","away team","venue","date","home team score","away team score" 
FROM public.t_1942_vfl_season
WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%essendon%' AND "venue" ILIKE '%yarraville%';

Conclusion:
- The data confirms that Essendon, as the away team, played at Yarraville Oval (on 16 May 1942 vs Footscray). This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as an existence statement within the available 1942 VFL season dataset (i.e., there exists at least one match where Essendon, as the away team, played at Yarraville Oval).
