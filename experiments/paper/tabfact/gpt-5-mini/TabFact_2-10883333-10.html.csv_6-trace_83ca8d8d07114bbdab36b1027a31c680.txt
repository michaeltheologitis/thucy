Claim interpreted: “North Melbourne have the second highest score out of all the away teams.” I interpret this as ranking away-team match scores in the available dataset and checking North Melbourne’s position.

Data source discovery
- Accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact12), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_1975_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Dataset size check
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result: 6

Evidence 1: Rank away-team scores by total points (descending)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team","away team score","home team",date,venue,
       (COALESCE(NULLIF(split_part(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', 1), ''), regexp_replace("away team score", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')))::int AS away_score_int
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
ORDER BY away_score_int DESC
LIMIT 10;
Results (top to bottom):
1) north melbourne | 17.19 (121) | vs st kilda | 7 june 1975 | moorabbin oval
2) carlton         | 16.10 (106) | vs fitzroy  | 7 june 1975 | junction oval
3) melbourne       | 14.14 (98)  | vs geelong  | 7 june 1975 | kardinia park
4) collingwood     | 13.11 (89)  | vs hawthorn | 7 june 1975 | princes park
5) south melbourne | 12.15 (87)  | vs footscray| 7 june 1975 | vfl park
6) essendon        | 12.9 (81)   | vs richmond | 7 june 1975 | mcg

Evidence 2: Explicitly compute North Melbourne’s rank among away-team scores
Executed SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT "away team", "away team score",
         (substring("away team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int AS points,
         rank() OVER (ORDER BY (substring("away team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int DESC) AS rank
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
)
SELECT * FROM ranked WHERE "away team" = 'north melbourne' ORDER BY points DESC;
Result:
away team: north melbourne | away team score: 17.19 (121) | points: 121 | rank: 1

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (6 matches dated 7 June 1975), North Melbourne has the highest away-team score (121 points), not the second highest. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The only accessible data pertains to a subset of the 1975 VFL season (6 matches on 7 June 1975). I interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset, ranking individual away-team match totals by their points (the number in parentheses).
