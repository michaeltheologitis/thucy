Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that the highest number of ties in a season by the Hurricanes occurred in 2003. Based on the available data source (public.dundee_hurricanes), I evaluate this for the Dundee Hurricanes.

Data source exploration:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact34), public schema.
- Relevant table: dundee_hurricanes (columns: season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes).

Evidence:
1) Determine the highest number of ties recorded in any season.
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(ties) AS max_ties FROM dundee_hurricanes;
Result: max_ties = 3

2) Identify which season(s) had that maximum number of ties.
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, ties FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE ties = 3 ORDER BY season;
Result: season = 2008, ties = 3

3) Check the number of ties in the 2003 season.
Executed SQL:
SELECT ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2003;
Result: ties = 0

Conclusion:
- The highest number of ties in a season (3) occurred in 2008, not in 2003.
- In 2003, the Dundee Hurricanes registered 0 ties.

Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “the hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes, as this is the authoritative Hurricanes-related dataset available in the connected data sources.
- “season” corresponds to the year value in the season column.
