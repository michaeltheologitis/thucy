Claim to verify: "porto be 1st in the liga for the 2003 - 2004 season, follow by benfica"

Summary conclusion: Supported by the available database: FC Porto ("porto") finished 1st and Benfica finished 2nd in the 2003–2004 league season.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source (via postgres_tabfact18) with a public schema containing a relevant table.

Schema inspection:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2004_05_primeira_liga
- Columns: club (text), head coach (text), city (text), stadium (text), "2003 - 2004 season" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Initial inspection to understand values and club naming:
SQL executed:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga LIMIT 50;
Result excerpt:
[{"2003 - 2004 season":"13th in the liga","club":"académica de coimbra"},
 {"2003 - 2004 season":"15th in the liga","club":"belenenses"},
 {"2003 - 2004 season":"2nd in the liga","club":"benfica"},
 ...,
 {"2003 - 2004 season":"1st in the liga","club":"porto"},
 ...]

2) Direct check for Porto and Benfica:
SQL executed:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE club IN ('porto','benfica');
Result:
[{"2003 - 2004 season":"2nd in the liga","club":"benfica"},
 {"2003 - 2004 season":"1st in the liga","club":"porto"}]

Assessment:
- The data explicitly states: FC Porto (listed as "porto") — "1st in the liga"; Benfica — "2nd in the liga" for the 2003–2004 season. This aligns exactly with the claim.

Assumptions:
- "Liga" refers to Portugal’s top division (Primeira Liga/Liga Portugal).
- "Porto" refers to FC Porto; "Benfica" refers to SL Benfica. The table stores club names in lowercase (e.g., "porto").
