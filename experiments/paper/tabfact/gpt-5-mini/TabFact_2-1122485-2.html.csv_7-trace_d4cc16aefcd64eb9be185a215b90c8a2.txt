Claim to verify (interpreted):
- John Love had the highest grid position at 25, followed by Howden Ganley at 16, with Dave Charlton in 1st position on the grid.

Data source explored:
- Database: tabfact21 (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
- Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Inspect driver name casing (to ensure exact matches)
SQL:
SELECT driver FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix LIMIT 50;
Excerpted result includes: howden ganley, dave charlton, john love

2) Grid positions for the three named drivers
SQL:
SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE driver IN ('john love','howden ganley','dave charlton') ORDER BY driver;
Result:
- dave charlton — 16
- howden ganley — 24
- john love — 21

3) Maximum grid value and who holds it (to test “highest position at 25”)
SQL:
SELECT MAX(grid) AS max_grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
Result:
max_grid = 25

SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" AS time_retired, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE grid = 25 ORDER BY driver;
Result:
- driver: alex soler - roig | constructor: march - ford | laps: 5 | time_retired: engine | grid: 25

4) Context rows for Dave Charlton and John Love
SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" AS time_retired, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE driver ILIKE '%Charlton%' OR driver ILIKE '%Love%' ORDER BY driver;
Result:
- dave charlton | brabham - ford | laps: 31 | time_retired: engine | grid: 16
- john love | march - ford | laps: 30 | time_retired: differential | grid: 21

Assessment against the claim:
- John Love at grid 25 (highest): False. Highest grid is 25, but it belongs to Alex Soler-Roig. John Love’s grid is 21.
- Howden Ganley at grid 16: False. Howden Ganley’s grid is 24.
- Dave Charlton in 1st grid position: False. Dave Charlton’s grid is 16, not 1.

Conclusion: Every element of the claim is contradicted by the dataset of the 1971 South African Grand Prix.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to grid (starting) positions for the 1971 South African Grand Prix, matching the available dataset.
- “1st position” is interpreted as grid position 1, not finishing position.
