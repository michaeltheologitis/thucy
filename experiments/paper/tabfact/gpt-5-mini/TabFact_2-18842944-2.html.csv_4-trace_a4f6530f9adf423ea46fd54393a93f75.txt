What I checked
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Buffalo Bills’ performance in the 1976 season (the only Bills dataset available in the connected database).

Data sources examined
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (game-level records for the 1976 Buffalo Bills)

Findings (with executed SQL)
1) Total number of games in 1976
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
- Result: total_games = 14

2) Number of wins
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'w%';
- Result: wins = 2

3) Number of losses
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'l%';
- Result: losses = 12

4) Number of ties
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS ties FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 't%';
- Result: ties = 0

Conclusion
- In the 1976 season, the Buffalo Bills lost more games than they won (12 losses, 2 wins). Within the scope of the available data, the claim is supported.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope: Limited to the 1976 Buffalo Bills season because this is the only relevant dataset available in the connected database.
- Parsing: Treated the result field’s first character as the outcome indicator (W/L/T), case-insensitive (ILIKE).
