Key evidence from the data
1) Show all rows to identify whether a summary/total row exists
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, "administrative panel", "agricultural panel", "cultural and educational panel", "industrial and commercial panel", "labour panel", "national university of ireland", "university of dublin", "nominated by the taoiseach", "total"
FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
ORDER BY CASE WHEN LOWER(TRIM(party)) = 'total' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END ASC, party;
Result excerpt (relevant row):
- party: total; administrative panel: 7; national university of ireland: 3; total: 60

2) Directly compute the difference on the summary row
Executed SQL:
SELECT "total", "administrative panel", "national university of ireland", ("administrative panel" - "national university of ireland") AS diff_adm_minus_nui
FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE lower("party") = 'total';
Result:
- total: 60; administrative panel: 7; national university of ireland: 3; administrative minus NUI: 4

3) Cross-check: find any row with exactly a 4-seat difference
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, "administrative panel", "national university of ireland", ("administrative panel" - "national university of ireland") AS difference
FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE ("administrative panel" - "national university of ireland") = 4;
Result:
- party: total; administrative panel: 7; national university of ireland: 3; difference: 4

Conclusion
- In the authoritative table members_of_the_5th_seanad, the summary (total) row shows 7 members from the Administrative Panel and 3 from the National University of Ireland, a difference of 4. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the overall composition captured by the summary (“total”) row in the table, not per-party subtotals. The columns “administrative panel” and “national university of ireland” in this table are taken as the definitive counts for verification.
