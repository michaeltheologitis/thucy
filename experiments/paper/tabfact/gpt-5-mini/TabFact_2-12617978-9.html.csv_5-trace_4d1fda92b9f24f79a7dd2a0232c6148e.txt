Claim interpreted: The statement “game alert ask for the least amount of money” is taken to mean that a pitch named “Game Alert” (or a closely named variant) asked for the smallest funding amount among entries in the accessible dataset. The only available dataset contains Dragons’ Den UK pitches, including company/product names and amounts requested.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact, public schema) with table dragons_den_uk.

Schema check
- Tool: schema_query
- Table: dragons_den_uk (columns: episode, first aired, entrepreneur (s), company or product name, money requested, investing dragon (s)).

Evidence 1: Is there an entry exactly matching “Game Alert”?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested"
  FROM dragons_den_uk
  WHERE "company or product name" ILIKE '%game alert%'
     OR "company or product name" ILIKE '%gamealert%';
- Result: No rows found.

Evidence 2: Are there related names (e.g., containing “alert”)?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested" 
  FROM dragons_den_uk
  WHERE lower("company or product name") LIKE '%alert%'
  ORDER BY "money requested" ASC;
- Result: 1 row
  - episode: episode 2; company or product name: gaming alerts; entrepreneur(s): emmie matthews & ed stevens; money requested: 200000.

Evidence 3: What is the minimum amount requested in the dataset?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("money requested") AS min_money FROM public.dragons_den_uk;
- Result: min_money = 35000.

Evidence 4: Which pitch(es) asked for the minimum amount?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("money requested") AS min_money_requested FROM dragons_den_uk;
  SELECT episode, "company or product name", "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested" 
  FROM dragons_den_uk 
  WHERE "money requested" = 35000 
  ORDER BY episode, "company or product name";
- Result: 1 row at the minimum
  - episode: episode 2; company or product name: youdoodoll; entrepreneur(s): sarah lu; money requested: 35000.

Context check (sample of table confirming presence of “gaming alerts” entry)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.dragons_den_uk LIMIT 5;
- Result (excerpt includes): company or product name: gaming alerts; money requested: 200000.

Conclusion
- There is no exact “Game Alert” entry in the dataset. The closely named “gaming alerts” requested 200000, which is not the least; the minimum requested amount in the table is 35000 (by “youdoodoll”). Therefore, the claim that “game alert ask for the least amount of money” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “game alert” to refer to a pitch name in the only available dataset (Dragons’ Den UK), with “gaming alerts” treated as the closest match.
- All verification is limited to the contents of the accessible dragons_den_uk table, treated as authoritative per instructions.
