Summary
The claim states: "there be a tfr of 2.45 in the period where the imr be 43." I verified this against the available authoritative data source (TabFact database, table public.my_info_table). The evidence shows that the period with IMR = 43 does not have TFR = 2.45; instead, it has TFR = 2.6. While there is a period with TFR = 2.45, that period’s IMR is 34, not 43.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the period(s) where IMR = 43 and check TFR
SQL:
SELECT period, tfr, imr FROM public.my_info_table WHERE imr = 43;
Result:
- period: 1990 - 1995, tfr: 2.6, imr: 43

2) Check whether any record has TFR exactly 2.45 and what its IMR is
SQL:
SELECT period, tfr, imr
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE tfr = 2.45
ORDER BY period;
Result:
- period: 1995 - 2000, tfr: 2.45, imr: 34

3) Directly test for a record where IMR = 43 and TFR = 2.45 simultaneously
SQL:
SELECT period, tfr, imr
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE imr = 43 AND tfr = 2.45;
Result: no rows returned

Conclusion
- The period with IMR = 43 (1990–1995) has TFR = 2.6, not 2.45.
- The period with TFR = 2.45 (1995–2000) has IMR = 34, not 43.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "period" refers to the period column in public.my_info_table.
- Numerical statements like "tfr of 2.45" and "imr be 43" are interpreted as exact matches against the stored values.
