Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the entry with series number 101 is in season 10.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.will_grace_season_5(series bigint, season text, title text, "directed by" text, "written by" text, "original air date" text, "us viewers (millions)" double precision)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Targeted verification
Executed SQL:
SELECT series, season, title FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE series = 101;
Result:
- series: 101
- season: 10
- title: the honeymoon 's over

2) Contextual listing (shows surrounding entries)
Executed SQL:
SELECT series, season, title FROM public.will_grace_season_5;
Excerpt of relevant row from full results:
- series: 101, season: 10, title: the honeymoon 's over

Conclusion:
- The data shows the row with series = 101 has season = 10. This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “series 101 be in season 10” as verifying that the record with series number 101 belongs to season 10 within the available Will & Grace dataset.
- Treated the "season" field as the season number even though it is stored as text.
- Scope is limited to the accessible table public.will_grace_season_5, which appears to catalog Will & Grace episodes around season 5 but includes overall series numbering and season numbers as provided in the table.
