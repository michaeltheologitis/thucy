SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'indianapolis_colts_draft_history'

Step 2: Retrieve draft rounds for Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, round, pick, overall
FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE name ILIKE '%Curtis%' OR name ILIKE '%Dickey%' OR name ILIKE '%Randy%' OR name ILIKE '%Bielski%';

Analysis
- Curtis Dickey was drafted in round 1.
- Randy Bielski was drafted in round 12.

Conclusion
