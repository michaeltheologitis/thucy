Summary
The claim states that “sergio garcía, pádraig harrington and charlie wi tie for 4th place with + 1 to par.” Using the available data source (TabFact/postgres_tabfact2), I verified this against the table t_2008_pga_championship. The data show that these three players are listed with place = t4 and to par = + 1, matching the claim.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact2), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_pga_championship with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify available place and to par values
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY place;
Result (distinct place values): 1, t2, t4, t7, t9

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "to par" FROM t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY "to par";
Result (distinct to par values): - 1, - 2, + 1, + 2, + 3

2) Show rows around top finishers (1–10 including ties)
SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", NULLIF(regexp_replace(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS place_num
FROM t_2008_pga_championship
WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int BETWEEN 1 AND 10
ORDER BY place_num, place;
Key returned rows:
- place=t4, player=sergio garcía, to par=+ 1
- place=t4, player=pádraig harrington, to par=+ 1
- place=t4, player=charlie wi, to par=+ 1

3) Directly verify the exact rows for place t4 and to par + 1
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE "to par" = '+ 1' ORDER BY player;
Returned rows:
- place=t4, player=charlie wi, country=south korea, score="70 + 70 + 71 = 211", to par=+ 1
- place=t4, player=pádraig harrington, country=ireland, score="71 + 74 + 66 = 211", to par=+ 1
- place=t4, player=sergio garcía, country=spain, score="69 + 73 + 69 = 211", to par=+ 1

Assessment
- The table explicitly lists sergio garcía, pádraig harrington, and charlie wi with place t4 and to par + 1.
- This directly supports the claim that they tied for 4th place at +1 to par.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions
- I interpret “tie for 4th place” as place value t4 in the dataset, which is consistent with standard golf leaderboard notation.
- The dataset appears to represent a leaderboard snapshot (scores show three rounds), but the claim does not specify round context; verification is based strictly on the provided table data.
- Matching for the place value is case-sensitive in the database; the stored value is “t4”.
