Claim interpreted: “4 of the competitions out of 10 are worldwide championships.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table identified: public.luk_melich (columns: year, competition, venue, position, notes)

Schema context (from inspection)
- public.luk_melich columns: year (bigint), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine total number of competitions (rows)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.luk_melich;
- Result:
  total_rows = 10

2) See how many times each competition appears
- SQL:
  SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.luk_melich
  GROUP BY competition
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, competition;
- Results (competition — count):
  - world championships — 3
  - olympic games — 2
  - european championships — 1
  - european junior championships — 1
  - european u23 championships — 1
  - universiade — 1
  - world junior championships — 1

3) Count competitions that are world-level championships (strings containing both “world” and “championship”)
- SQL (total matching):
  SELECT count(*) AS total_world_championship_rows
  FROM public.luk_melich
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%world%championship%';
- Result:
  total_world_championship_rows = 4

- SQL (breakdown of matching values):
  SELECT competition, count(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.luk_melich
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%world%championship%'
  GROUP BY competition
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, competition;
- Results:
  - world championships — 3
  - world junior championships — 1

Conclusion
- There are 10 total competition entries.
- Of these, 4 entries are world-level championships (3 “world championships” + 1 “world junior championships”).
- Therefore, the claim that 4 of the competitions out of 10 are worldwide championships is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Worldwide championship” is interpreted as any competition whose name includes both the words “world” and “championship,” which encompasses both senior and junior world championships.
