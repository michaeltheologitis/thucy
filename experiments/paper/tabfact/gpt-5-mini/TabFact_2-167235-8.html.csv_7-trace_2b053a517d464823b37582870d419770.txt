Claim: “the term end for aleksandër meksi be after the term end for ylli bufi.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  Columns:
  - name (text)
  - born - died (text)
  - term start (text)
  - term end (text)
  - political party (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve stored term-end values (both individuals):
SQL Query:
SELECT name, "term end" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%';
Result:
- name: "ylli bufi", term end: "10 december 1991"
- name: "aleksandër meksi", term end: "11 march 1997"

2) Parse the term-end text into dates for reliable comparison:
SQL Query:
SELECT name, "term end", to_date("term end", 'DD FMMonth YYYY') AS term_end_date FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%';
Result:
- name: "ylli bufi", term end: "10 december 1991", term_end_date: 1991-12-10
- name: "aleksandër meksi", term end: "11 march 1997", term_end_date: 1997-03-11

3) Direct boolean comparison of parsed dates:
SQL Query:
WITH pm AS (
  SELECT name, to_date("term end", 'DD FMMonth YYYY') AS term_end_date
  FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%'
)
SELECT
  (SELECT term_end_date FROM pm WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%') >
  (SELECT term_end_date FROM pm WHERE name ILIKE '%Bufi%') AS meksi_after_bufi,
  (SELECT term_end_date FROM pm WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%') AS meksi_end,
  (SELECT term_end_date FROM pm WHERE name ILIKE '%Bufi%') AS bufi_end;
Result:
- meksi_after_bufi: true
- meksi_end: 1997-03-11
- bufi_end: 1991-12-10

Conclusion:
- Aleksandër Meksi’s term ended on 1997-03-11, which is after Ylli Bufi’s term end on 1991-12-10. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “term end” refers to the end date of their tenure as Prime Minister of Albania as listed in the table.
- Name matching used ILIKE with '%Meksi%' and '%Bufi%' to account for casing/diacritics; the results show the intended individuals uniquely.
