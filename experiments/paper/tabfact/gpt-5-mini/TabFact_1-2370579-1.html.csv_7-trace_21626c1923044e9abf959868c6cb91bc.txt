Claim to verify: “on jul / aug 1966 , there 's somebody close behind you be film.” Interpreted as: the episode titled “there 's somebody close behind you” was filmed in Jul/Aug 1966.

Data sources consulted
- postgres_tabfact19 database (public schema). Relevant table: public.the_baron with columns: episode, prod, title, "directed by", "written by", originalairdate, filmed.

Method
- Identify the episode by title and retrieve its filming date.
- Independently list all episodes whose filmed field indicates Jul/Aug 1966 to see what was filmed then.

Evidence

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, prod, title, originalairdate, filmed
  FROM public.the_baron
  WHERE title ILIKE '%behind%';

2) Retrieve the full record for “there 's somebody close behind you”

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, prod, title, "directed by", "written by", originalairdate, filmed
  FROM public.the_baron

  ORDER BY episode;

Analysis
- The episode titled “there 's somebody close behind you” (Episode 14) was filmed in Dec 1965, not in Jul/Aug 1966.
- Jul/Aug 1966 filming pertains to other episodes (notably “storm warning (part one)” and “the island (part two)”), not to “there 's somebody close behind you.”

Conclusion
- The claim that “there 's somebody close behind you” was filmed in Jul/Aug 1966 is contradicted by the data. It was filmed in Dec 1965.

Assumptions made
- “be film” is interpreted as “was filmed.”
- The claim refers to the TV series The Baron and the episode titled “there 's somebody close behind you,” matching the title stored in public.the_baron.title.
- Filming month/year is taken from the public.the_baron.filmed field, which is treated as authoritative.
