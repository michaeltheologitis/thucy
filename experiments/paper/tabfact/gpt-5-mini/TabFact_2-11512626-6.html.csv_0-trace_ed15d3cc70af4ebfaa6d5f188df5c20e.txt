Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database, schema public.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season with columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify games on August 30 and August 31 and check the listed losing pitchers.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record
FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
WHERE date = 'august 30' OR date = 'august 31';

Query results:
- Row 1
  - date: august 30
  - opponent: athletics
  - score: 4 - 3
  - loss: mohler (1 - 10)
  - record: 67 - 70

- Row 2
  - date: august 31
  - opponent: athletics
  - score: 10 - 4
  - loss: oquist (2 - 5)
  - record: 68 - 70

Conclusion
- The data shows that on August 30, the losing pitcher was listed as “mohler (1 - 10).”
- The data shows that on August 31, the losing pitcher was listed as “oquist (2 - 5).”
- This directly supports the claim that on August 30 Mohler (1-10) took the loss, and on August 31 Oquist (2-5) took the loss.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the MLB games recorded in the table public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season; the year is 1997 based on the table name.
- The date field uses lowercase month names (e.g., “august 30”/“august 31”).
