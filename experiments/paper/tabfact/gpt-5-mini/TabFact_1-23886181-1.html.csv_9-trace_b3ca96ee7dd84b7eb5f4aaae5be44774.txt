Claim to verify: “team brazil, team australia, and team england be 3 of the club that participate in the 2008 season.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact12 (trusted)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  - Columns: no (text), football club (text), continent (text), associated football club (text), seasons (text), racing drivers (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify any clubs named with the “team …” pattern and see their seasons
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", seasons
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%team%';

Results:
- team luxembourg — seasons: 2011
- team new zealand — seasons: 2011
- team japan — seasons: 2011
- team netherlands — seasons: 2011
- team brazil — seasons: 2011
- team australia — seasons: 2011
- team england — seasons: 2011

2) Directly fetch the three named clubs and their seasons
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", seasons
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE lower("football club") IN ('team brazil','team australia','team england');

Results:
- team brazil — seasons: 2011
- team australia — seasons: 2011
- team england — seasons: 2011

3) List all clubs that participated in 2008 (to understand who did appear that year)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", "seasons"
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE "seasons" ILIKE '%2008%'
ORDER BY "football club";

Results:
- ac milan — seasons: 2008 2009 2010
- beijing guoan — seasons: 2008 2010
- fc basel 1893 — seasons: 2008 2009 2010
- rangers fc — seasons: 2008 2009
- rsc anderlecht — seasons: 2008 2009 2010 2011

4) Explicitly confirm whether the three named clubs have 2008 in their seasons
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", "seasons", ("seasons" ILIKE '%2008%') AS has_2008
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
WHERE lower("football club") IN ('team brazil','team australia','team england')
ORDER BY "football club";

Results:
- team australia — seasons: 2011 — has_2008: false
- team brazil — seasons: 2011 — has_2008: false
- team england — seasons: 2011 — has_2008: false

Conclusion
- The database shows that “team brazil,” “team australia,” and “team england” exist in the table, but their seasons entry is 2011. None have 2008 listed, and they do not appear among the clubs that participated in 2008.
- Therefore, the claim that these three were among the clubs participating in the 2008 season is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Participation in a season is inferred by the presence of the year as a substring in the seasons text column (matched using ILIKE '%2008%').
- Club name comparison is performed case-insensitively on the “football club” field.
