Summary
- Claim interpreted: After July 13, 2003, for rows where the opponent is “roger federer,” the surface is clay.
- Finding: The dataset contains exactly one row with opponent Roger Federer dated July 13, 2003 (surface = clay). There are no rows with opponent Roger Federer after that date. Therefore, the claim about “after July 13, 2003” is not supported by the data.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact11 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: ji_nov_k with columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text).

Schema inspection (tool result)
- Table ji_nov_k appears to store match records with date, tournament, surface, opponent, and score (no primary key or constraints; date is stored as text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Show all rows with opponent = Roger Federer
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score, to_date(initcap(replace(date,' , ', ', ')),'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS match_date
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer'
ORDER BY match_date;
Result:
- date: "july 13 , 2003"; tournament: "gstaad , switzerland"; surface: "clay"; opponent: "roger federer"; score: "5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 3"; match_date: 2003-07-13
Interpretation: Exactly one row exists with opponent Roger Federer, and it is dated July 13, 2003 (surface = clay).

2) Check for any rows with opponent = Roger Federer after July 13, 2003
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score, to_date(initcap(replace(date,' , ', ', ')),'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS match_date
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer'
  AND to_date(initcap(replace(date,' , ', ', ')),'FMMonth DD, YYYY') > DATE '2003-07-13'
ORDER BY match_date;
Result:
- No rows returned.
Interpretation: There are no matches in this table against Roger Federer after 2003-07-13.

Conclusion
- The statement about “after July 13, 2003” cannot be supported: there are no records with opponent Roger Federer after that date in the available data. Thus, asserting the surface “be clay” after that date is not substantiated by the data.

Assumptions noted
- I interpreted the claim as asserting that there exists at least one match after 2003-07-13 where the opponent is Roger Federer and the surface is clay, or that, for all such matches after that date, the surface is clay. The dataset contains no such matches after the specified date. If the intended meaning was “on July 13, 2003,” then the record shows surface = clay, but this is not “after” the date as worded.
