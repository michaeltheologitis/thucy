Scope and data sources
- Discovered data asset: TabFact (postgres_tabfact24), schema public, table: list_of_csi_miami_characters. This table includes character, position (role), actor, first episode, final episode, duration, and final episode count for CSI: Miami characters.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify DEA agents and check their first episode
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position, "first episode" FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters WHERE position ILIKE '%DEA%';
- Result:
  - Bob Keaton — position: DEA agent — first episode: Big Brother
- Finding: The only DEA agent listed is Bob Keaton, and his first episode is Big Brother, not Vengeance.

2) Check if any character’s first episode is titled “Vengeance”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position, "first episode" FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters;
- Result (subset shown for relevant column): first episode values present are: bolt action, blood brothers, from the grave, double cap, crime wave, invasion, going under, simple man, wet foot / dry foot, hell night, the best defense, the oath, hard time, money for nothing, urban hellraisers, one of our own, Big Brother, mia / nyc nonstop (multiple entries). None are “Vengeance”. Full row count verified below.
- Executed SQL (row count confirmation):
SELECT count(*) FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters;
- Result: 22
- Finding: Among all 22 rows, no “first episode” contains the word “Vengeance”.

Conclusion
- The data shows the DEA agent (Bob Keaton) has first episode Big Brother. No first episode titled Vengeance exists in this dataset. Therefore, the claim that “the first episode for [a] DEA agent [is] ‘Vengeance’” is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available CSI: Miami dataset, where “DEA agent” refers to a character with position containing “DEA”.
- Interpreted “first episode” as the first appearance of the character as stored in the first episode column.
- Case-insensitive matching was used when searching for “DEA” and “Vengeance”.
