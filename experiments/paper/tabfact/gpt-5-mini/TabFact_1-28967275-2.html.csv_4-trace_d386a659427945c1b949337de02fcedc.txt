Summary of verification process
- I explored the available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact20) with one relevant table (public.my_info_table) containing episode metadata, including episode number and original air date.

Key evidence from the data
1) Episode 31 details
- Result: series: 5; episode: 31; episode title: the homecoming; original air date: 19 april 2008; production code: 205
- Executed SQL:
SELECT series, episode, "episode title", "original air date", "production code" 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE episode = 31;

2) Entries with original air date of 19 April 2008
- Result: series: 5; episode: 31; episode title: the homecoming; original air date: 19 april 2008; production code: 205
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "series", "episode", "episode title", "original air date", "production code"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%19 April 2008%';

Conclusion
- The database shows that episode 31 has an original air date of 19 April 2008. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The table represents a single TV series (the table lacks a show title column). The claim is interpreted as referring to this dataset’s series. The phrasing “19april 2008” is taken to mean “19 April 2008,” and “originally air” refers to the original broadcast date.
