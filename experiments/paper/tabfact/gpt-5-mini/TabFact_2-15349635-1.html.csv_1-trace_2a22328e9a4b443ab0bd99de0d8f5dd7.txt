Claim to verify: "the top 2 team have the same number of point but separate by a goal difference"

What the data shows (TabFact -> public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football):
- Positions 1 and 2 both have 13 points.
- Their goal difference values are different (8 vs 10).

Direct evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve positions 1 and 2 with key fields
SQL:
SELECT "position", "team", "points", "played", "against", "difference"
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
WHERE "position" IN (1,2)
ORDER BY "position";
Result:
- position: 1, team: flamengo, points: 13, played: 8, against: 12, difference: 8
- position: 2, team: fluminense, points: 13, played: 8, against: 15, difference: 10

2) Explicitly check equality of points and difference among the top two
SQL:
SELECT (p1.points = p2.points) AS same_points,
       (p1.difference <> p2.difference) AS different_goal_differences,
       p1.points AS points_pos1, p2.points AS points_pos2,
       p1.difference AS diff_pos1, p2.difference AS diff_pos2
FROM (SELECT points, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 1) p1
CROSS JOIN (SELECT points, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 2) p2;
Result:
- same_points: true, different_goal_differences: true, points_pos1: 13, points_pos2: 13, diff_pos1: 8, diff_pos2: 10

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported: the top two teams have the same points (13 each) and are differentiated by their goal difference values (8 vs 10).

Assumptions noted:
- "Top 2 team" refers to rows where position = 1 and position = 2 in the public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football table.
- "Separate by a goal difference" is interpreted as the two teams having different goal difference values, not as a statement about which tiebreak rule was applied for ordering.
