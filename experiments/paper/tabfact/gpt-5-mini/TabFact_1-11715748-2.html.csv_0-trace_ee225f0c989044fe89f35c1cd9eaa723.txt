Interpreted claim: “season 13 be directed by William Malone.” I interpret this as asserting that the Season 13 entry in the available episodes list was directed by William Malone.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact9 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes (columns: series, season, title, director (s), writer (s), original airdate)

Evidence 1 — Find all episodes directed by William Malone:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT series, season, title, "director (s)" AS directors, "original airdate" AS original_airdate
  FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes
  WHERE "director (s)" ILIKE '%William Malone%'
  ORDER BY series, season;
- Result (subset shown relevant to claim):
  • series: 35, season: 13, title: "easy come , easy go", director(s): william malone, original airdate: january 8 , 1990

Evidence 2 — Inspect the Season 13 row directly:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE season = 13;
- Result:
  • series: 35
  • season: 13
  • title: easy come , easy go
  • director (s): william malone
  • writer (s): david braff
  • original airdate: january 8 , 1990

Conclusion:
- The entry with season = 13 in the available episodes table lists the director as “william malone.” Therefore, the claim that “season 13 [is] directed by William Malone” is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “be direct” was interpreted as “be directed.”
- The user’s reference to “season 13” pertains to the season field in the available table (public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes).
