Summary conclusion
- Spy vs Spy is listed under the arcade genre in the available dataset.
- It is not listed with the Dragon 32 platform; instead, the platforms shown are C64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify table structure (to understand platform fields)
SQL:
SELECT column_name
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'beyond_software'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Key columns observed: title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format.

2) Retrieve the Spy vs Spy entry and its platforms/genre
SQL:
SELECT title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format
FROM public.beyond_software
WHERE title ILIKE '%spy%';
Result (single row):
- title: spy vs spy
- genre: arcade
- c = 64: c64
- zx spectrum: zx spectrum
- others: amstrad cpc
- year: 1984
- format: tape
Interpretation: The game is categorized as arcade, and the listed platforms are C64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. No Dragon 32 is indicated for this title.

3) Verify whether Dragon 32 appears in the dataset (to ensure the platform is represented when applicable)
SQL:
SELECT title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format
FROM beyond_software
WHERE ("c = 64" ILIKE '%dragon%' OR "zx spectrum" ILIKE '%dragon%' OR others ILIKE '%dragon%' OR format ILIKE '%dragon%');
Results (2 rows shown):
1) title: Kriegspiel | genre: strategy | c = 64: n / a | zx spectrum: n / a | others: dragon 32 | year: 1983 | format: tape
2) title: Up Periscope | genre: strategy | c = 64: n / a | zx spectrum: n / a | others: dragon 32 | year: 1983 | format: tape
Interpretation: The dataset does list Dragon 32 for some titles, so the absence of Dragon 32 on Spy vs Spy is meaningful within this data.

Conclusion
- True: Spy vs Spy is listed under the arcade genre.
- Not supported/Contradicted: It is not listed with the Dragon 32 platform in this dataset.

Assumptions
- "spy v spy" refers to the game entry titled "spy vs spy" found in the table.
- "with dragon 32" means the game is available/listed for the Dragon 32 platform within this dataset, which would appear in the platform-related columns (e.g., others).
