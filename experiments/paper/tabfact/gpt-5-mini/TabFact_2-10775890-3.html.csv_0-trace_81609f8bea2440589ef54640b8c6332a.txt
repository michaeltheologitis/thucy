Claim to verify: “On 7 May 1960, a crowd of 9000 watched the away team, Richmond, score 3.8 (26).”

Summary of findings:
- Date: 7 May 1960 — matches data
- Away team: Richmond — matches data
- Away team score: 3.8 (26) — matches data
- Crowd: 9000 — matches data
- Context from the same row: Home team was North Melbourne at Arden Street Oval

Supporting evidence from data (exact executed SQL and results):

SQL executed:
SELECT "date","home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue","crowd" FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season WHERE "date" ILIKE '%May 1960%';

2) Direct retrieval of the specific match row
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd"
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '7 may 1960' AND LOWER("away team") = 'richmond';
Result:
- date: 7 may 1960

- away team: richmond
- away team score: 3.8 (26)
- venue: arden street oval
