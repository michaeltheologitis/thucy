What I checked
- Located available data sources and identified a single relevant table: public.zakspeed in the TabFact PostgreSQL database.
- Inspected the schema to confirm it contains fields for year, chassis, and engine(s).
- Queried the table for the Zakspeed 891 chassis to verify the recorded engine.

Schema evidence
- Table: public.zakspeed
  Columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint)

Evidence query and result
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)", tyres, points
FROM zakspeed
WHERE chassis ILIKE '%891%';

Result:
- year: 1989
  chassis: zakspeed 891
  engine(s): yamaha v8
  tyres: p
  points: 0

Conclusion
- The data explicitly lists the Zakspeed 891 chassis with a "yamaha v8" engine. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1989 Zakspeed 891 Formula 1 chassis as recorded in the available dataset.
