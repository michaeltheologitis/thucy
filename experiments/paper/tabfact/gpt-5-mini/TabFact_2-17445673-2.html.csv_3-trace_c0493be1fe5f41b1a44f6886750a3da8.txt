Claim interpreted: “The match with the shortest time was a win against Joe Campanella.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.tim_lajcik (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)

Step 1 — Find the minimal reported time (MM:SS) across all matches
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN((split_part(time, ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(time, ':', 2)::int)) AS min_seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE time ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-5][0-9]$';
Result:
- min_seconds = 18

Step 2 — Retrieve the match(es) with that minimal time
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time, method
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE time ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-5][0-9]$'
  AND (split_part(time, ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(time, ':', 2)::int) = 18;
Result:
- opponent: joe campanella; res: win; event: ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7; round: 1; time: 0:18; method: tko

Step 3 — Cross-check all matches vs Campanella
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time, method, record
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%campanella%';
Result:
- opponent: joe campanella; res: win; event: ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7; round: 1; time: 0:18; method: tko; record: 5 - 2 - 1

Conclusion
- The shortest reported time in the dataset is 0:18, and that match was indeed a win against Joe Campanella. The evidence supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “shortest time” as the minimal within-round time recorded in the time column (assumed MM:SS format).
- Excluded rows with null or nonconforming time formats from the minimum-time computation.
- Did not adjust for total fight duration across multiple rounds, since round lengths are not provided in the data and the time column appears to represent within-round time.
