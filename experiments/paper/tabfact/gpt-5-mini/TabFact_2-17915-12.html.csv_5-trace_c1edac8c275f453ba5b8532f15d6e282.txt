Summary conclusion: The claim is incorrect on the years. The available data shows Lleyton Hewitt’s two Masters Series (ATP Masters 1000) titles were at Indian Wells in 2002 and 2003, not in 2004 and 2005. In 2004 and 2005 he was a runner-up at Cincinnati (2004) and Indian Wells (2005).

Data source discovery:
- Discovered database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: lleyton_hewitt (columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify how wins are recorded and list all wins
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT outcome FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: [{"outcome":"runner - up"}, {"outcome":"winner"}]

- SQL:
SELECT year, championship FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE outcome = 'winner' ORDER BY year;
Result: [{"championship":"indian wells","year":2002}, {"championship":"indian wells (2)","year":2003}]

Interpretation: The only winner rows are Indian Wells 2002 and Indian Wells 2003, which are ATP Masters Series events.

2) Count total wins in the table
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS win_count FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE outcome='winner';
Result: [{"win_count":2}]

Interpretation: Exactly two tournament wins are recorded, both at Indian Wells.

3) Check 2004 and 2005 outcomes
- SQL:
SELECT year, championship, outcome FROM lleyton_hewitt WHERE year IN (2004, 2005) ORDER BY year, championship;
Result:
2004 — cincinnati (2) — runner - up
2005 — indian wells — runner - up

Interpretation: In 2004 and 2005, Lleyton Hewitt did not win these Masters tournaments; he finished as runner-up.

Conclusion: The dataset shows two Masters Series titles for Hewitt, but they occurred in 2002 and 2003 (Indian Wells), not in 2004 and 2005. Therefore, the claim that he won the Masters Series two times in 2004 and 2005 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Master series” refers to the ATP Masters Series (now ATP Masters 1000). Indian Wells and Cincinnati are Masters-level events.
- Rows with outcome = 'winner' indicate tournament titles won by Lleyton Hewitt.
