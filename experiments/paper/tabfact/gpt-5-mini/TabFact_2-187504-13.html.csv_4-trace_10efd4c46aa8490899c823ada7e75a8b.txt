Summary
- Claim: “the soviet union receive 4 more medal than east germany in the total medal count.”
- Scope of verification: 1988 Winter Olympics (based on the only available data source).

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL (TabFact) with one table in public schema: t_1988_winter_olympics.

Schema checked
- Table: public.t_1988_winter_olympics
  - Columns: rank (bigint), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve medal counts for the two nations
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation IN ('soviet union (urs)', 'east germany (gdr)') ORDER BY nation;
Result:
- east germany (gdr): gold=9, silver=10, bronze=6, total=25
- soviet union (urs): gold=11, silver=9, bronze=9, total=29

2) Compute the difference (Soviet Union minus East Germany)
SQL:
SELECT s.total - e.total AS difference FROM (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation='soviet union (urs)') s CROSS JOIN (SELECT total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation='east germany (gdr)') e;
Result:
- difference = 4

Conclusion
- In the 1988 Winter Olympics, the Soviet Union had 29 total medals and East Germany had 25 total medals. The difference is 4, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the only accessible dataset (1988 Winter Olympics) and “total medal count” refers to the total column for that event.
- Nation names are matched as stored: “soviet union (urs)” and “east germany (gdr)”.
