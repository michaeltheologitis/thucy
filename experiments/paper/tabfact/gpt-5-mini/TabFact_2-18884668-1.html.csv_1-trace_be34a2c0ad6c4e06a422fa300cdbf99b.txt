Claim interpreted: “the pisa elector be elevate in 1117.” I interpret this as: In the context of the papal election (1119), the elector associated with Pisa was elevated (to the cardinalate) in 1117.

Data discovery and schema:
- Available source: TabFact (PostgreSQL). Public schema contains table: papal_election_1119 with columns: elector (text), nationality (text), “cardinalatial order and title” (text), elevated (text), elevator (text).

Evidence from data:
1) Locate any elector associated with Pisa and check their elevation year.
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT elector, nationality, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator
   FROM papal_election_1119
   WHERE nationality ILIKE '%pisa%' OR nationality ILIKE '%pisan%';
   Result:
   - Elector: crisogono malcondini
     Nationality: pisa
     Cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of s nicola in carcere
     Elevated year: 1117
     Elevator: paschal ii

2) Cross-check (broader Pisa association filter across elector and nationality fields).
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT elector, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator
   FROM papal_election_1119
   WHERE (nationality ILIKE '%pisa%' OR nationality ILIKE '%pisan%' OR elector ILIKE '%pisa%' OR elector ILIKE '%pisan%');
   Result:
   - elector: crisogono malcondini | cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - deacon of s nicola in carcere | elevated: 1117 | elevator: paschal ii

Conclusion:
- The table identifies an elector with nationality “pisa” (Crisogono Malcondini) whose elevated year is 1117. This supports the claim that the Pisa elector was elevated in 1117.

Assumptions:
- “Pisa elector” refers to the elector listed with nationality “pisa” in the papal_election_1119 table.
- “Elevate” refers to elevation to the cardinalate, as represented by the “elevated” column in the table.
- The context is the papal election of 1119 (as indicated by the table name).
