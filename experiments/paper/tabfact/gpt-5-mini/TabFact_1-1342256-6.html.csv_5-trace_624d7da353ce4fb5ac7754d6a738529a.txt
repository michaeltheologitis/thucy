Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that in a race featuring John J. Phillips (R) and N. E. West (D), Phillips received 57.6% of the vote, West received 42.4%, and that West is from the Democratic Party.

What I checked in the data:
- Searched the available elections dataset for any row mentioning John J. Phillips or N. E. West to verify candidate names, party affiliations, and vote percentages.

Evidence found:
- Data source: TabFact (public schema), table united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
- Matching row:
  - district: california 22
  - incumbent: none (district created)
  - party: none (district created)
  - candidates: john j phillips (r) 57.6% n e west (d) 42.4%
  - result: new seat republican gain

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT district, incumbent, party, candidates, result
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
WHERE candidates ~* '(john\s*j\.?\s*phillips|phillips|n\.?\s*e\.?\s*west|west)'
   OR result ~* '(john\s*j\.?\s*phillips|phillips|n\.?\s*e\.?\s*west|west)';

Conclusion:
- The dataset explicitly lists the candidates line as: "john j phillips (r) 57.6% n e west (d) 42.4%" for California’s 22nd congressional district in 1942. This confirms both the percentages and that N. E. West is identified with “(d)”, i.e., the Democratic Party.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the 1942 U.S. House election for California’s 22nd district, which is the record found in the available data. If another year or jurisdiction was intended, it is not represented in the accessible dataset.
