Claim interpreted: “5 be the tie no before the away team be Woking.” I interpret this as asserting that the tie number is 5 for a match where the away team is Woking.

Findings from the data (postgres_tabfact17.public.t_1990_91_fa_cup):
- There is no match where Woking is the away team.
- Woking appears as the HOME team in tie no “5” (Woking 0 - 1 Everton).

Supporting evidence and exact executed SQL:
1) Full listing to inspect teams and tie numbers
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup ORDER BY "tie no" LIMIT 100;
Key returned rows (excerpt):
- {"tie no":"5","home team":"woking","score":"0 - 1","away team":"everton","date":"27 / 01 / 1991"}
Observation: Woking is the HOME team in tie 5; not the away team.

2) Table size to confirm coverage
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup;
Result: {"count":24}

3) Direct check for Woking as away team (case-insensitive, trimmed)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower(trim("away team")) = 'woking';
Result: match_count = 0

4) Broader substring check for Woking as away team (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS like_count
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower("away team") LIKE '%woking%';
Result: like_count = 0

Conclusion:
- The claim that tie no is 5 “before the away team be Woking” (interpreted as Woking being the away team in tie 5) is contradicted by the data. In tie 5, Woking is the HOME team and the away team is Everton. There are no rows with Woking as the away team.

Assumptions made:
- I interpreted the phrase as a verification that the tie number is 5 for a match where the away team is Woking. If the intent was simply “Woking’s match is tie no 5” (regardless of home/away), then the statement would be true for Woking as the home team, but that is not what the claim states.
