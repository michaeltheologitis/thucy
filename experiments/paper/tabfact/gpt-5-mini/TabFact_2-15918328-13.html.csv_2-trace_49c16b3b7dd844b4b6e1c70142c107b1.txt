Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced a contemporary piece together on So You Think You Can Dance (U.S.) Season 4.

Data sources consulted: TabFact database, public schema, table: so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 (columns: couple, style, music, choreographer (s), results).

Step 1: Identify rows involving both Katee Shean and Joshua Allen
Executed SQL:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE couple ILIKE '%Katee%' AND couple ILIKE '%Joshua%';

Result rows:
1) couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: contemporary | music: all by myself - celine dion | choreographer (s): tyce diorio | results: safe
2) couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: paso doble   | music: filet from le rêve           | choreographer (s): jason gilkison | results: safe

Step 2: Confirm they have a contemporary routine and count it
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE style ILIKE 'contemporary' AND couple ILIKE '%katee%' AND couple ILIKE '%joshua%';

Query result: count = 1

Step 3: (Sanity check) Look for alternative attributions (e.g., Mia Michaels or song “Hometown Glory”)
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE music ILIKE '%hometown glory%'
   OR "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%mia michaels%';

Query result: count = 0

Conclusion based on data: The table shows that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced at least one contemporary piece together: “All by Myself – Celine Dion,” choreographed by Tyce DiOrio. Therefore, the core claim that they danced a contemporary piece is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim is interpreted as asserting that the pair performed at least one contemporary routine together during SYTYCD U.S. Season 4.
- Name matching used case-insensitive substring search because the couple field in the data appears in lowercase without conjunctions (e.g., “katee shean joshua allen”).
