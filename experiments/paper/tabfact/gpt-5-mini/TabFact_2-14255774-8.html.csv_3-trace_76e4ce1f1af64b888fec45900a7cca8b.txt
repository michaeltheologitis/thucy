Claim interpreted: The Arizona Diamondbacks player “Rosales” had 3 losses (was the losing pitcher three times) during September.

Data sources explored
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table found: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (game-level records; date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record). No other Diamondbacks season tables or Rosales-specific tables exist in this data source.

Scope check: What period does this table cover?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
  Result: 26 rows
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT split_part(date, ' ', 1) AS month FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season ORDER BY month;
  Result: month = september
Interpretation: The table comprises September games only (26 games), which is consistent with a full month’s schedule.

Verification: How many September games list “Rosales” as the losing pitcher?
- SQL executed (list matches):
  SELECT date, opponent, loss FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE loss ILIKE '%rosales%' AND date ILIKE '%Sep%';
  Result: 1 match — date: "september 25", opponent: "cardinals", loss: "rosales (1 - 1)"
- SQL executed (count matches):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS rosales_losses_in_september FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE loss ILIKE '%rosales%' AND date ILIKE '%Sep%';
  Result: rosales_losses_in_september = 1

Conclusion
- The data show “Rosales” was the losing pitcher once in September (on September 25), not three times. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Player Rosales” refers to the Diamondbacks pitcher listed as “rosales” in the loss field (likely Leo Rosales) in the 2008 September game logs.
- “3x loss during September” is interpreted as being credited with three pitching losses in that month.
