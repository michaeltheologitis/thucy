Scope and data sources discovered
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema)
- Tables found: media_in_kelowna(frequency text, "call sign" text, branding text, format text, owner text)

Step 1: Inspect available schema
No SQL needed beyond schema inspection (see discovery above).

Step 2: Identify stations owned by Vista Broadcast Group in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner
FROM media_in_kelowna
WHERE owner ILIKE '%Vista%';

Result:
- frequency: 0 103.9 fm; call sign: cjui - fm; branding: 103.9 the juice; format: adult hits; owner: vista broadcast group

Step 3: Confirm count and formats for Vista-owned entries
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE 'vista broadcast group';

Result: 1

Executed SQL (distinct formats):
SELECT DISTINCT format FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE 'vista broadcast group' ORDER BY format;

Result: adult hits

Step 4: Contextualize “hits” formats in the same market
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner
FROM media_in_kelowna
WHERE lower(format) LIKE '%hits%';

Results:
1) 99.9 Sun FM (CHSU-FM) — format: contemporary hits radio — owner: Bell Media
2) 103.9 The Juice (CJUI-FM) — format: adult hits — owner: vista broadcast group

Findings
- The dataset shows Vista Broadcast Group as the owner of CJUI-FM (103.9 The Juice) in Kelowna, with a stated format of “adult hits.”
- “Adult hits” is a hits-oriented format, supporting that at least one Vista-owned station in this dataset plays “hits.”
- The claim “play all type of hit” is broader than what the data explicitly supports. The data confirms “adult hits,” not “all types of hits.”

Conclusion
- The available data supports that Vista Broadcast Group (in this dataset) operates a station that plays hits (specifically adult hits). It does not substantiate the broader phrasing “all type of hit.”

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted as referring to the programming/format of Vista Broadcast Group’s stations, and evidence was sought in the available Kelowna media dataset.
- “Play all type of hit” was taken to mean a hits-oriented format, not literally every genre/type. The database scope is limited to Kelowna and may not reflect all Vista markets.
