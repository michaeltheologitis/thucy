Claim to verify: “galina voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court, and 1 on clay.”

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Finding: One PostgreSQL database available (TabFact), public schema.

Schema check
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Table public.galina_voskoboeva with columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text). This appears to list Galina Voskoboeva’s match results, including surface.

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Total number of matches (rows)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
- Result: total_matches = 5

2) Breakdown by surface (as stored)
- SQL:
  SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  GROUP BY surface
  ORDER BY match_count DESC;
- Results:
  - surface = "hard (i)", match_count = 2
  - surface = "clay", match_count = 2
  - surface = "hard", match_count = 1

3) Exact-case counts for literal ‘Hard’ and ‘Clay’ (to check casing)
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN surface = 'Hard' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Hard_exact,
         SUM(CASE WHEN surface = 'Clay' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS Clay_exact
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
- Result: Hard_exact = 0, Clay_exact = 0

4) Variant-aware (case-insensitive) counts for hard and clay
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN lower(surface) LIKE '%hard%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS hard_variants,
         SUM(CASE WHEN lower(surface) LIKE '%clay%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clay_variants
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;
- Results: hard_variants = 3, clay_variants = 2

Assessment of the claim
- “3 game on a hard tennis court”: Supported when treating “hard (i)” (hard indoor) as a hard-court variant. Data shows 3 hard-related matches (1 “hard” + 2 “hard (i)”).
- “1 on clay”: Not supported. Data shows 2 matches on clay.

Conclusion: The hard-court count is correct; the clay count is not.

Assumptions
- “game” is interpreted as “match.”
- “hard” includes both “hard” and “hard (i)” (indoor hard) as counted by the variant-aware query.
- Verification is based on the entirety of the available table public.galina_voskoboeva in the TabFact database.
