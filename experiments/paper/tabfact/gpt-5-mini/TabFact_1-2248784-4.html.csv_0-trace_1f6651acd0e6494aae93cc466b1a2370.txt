Claim to verify
- Iran ranks 1st in GDP in the Middle East.
- Iran ranks 6th in all of Asia.

Data sources discovered
- Connected database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact14), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
  - Columns: "rank mideast" (bigint), "rank asia" (bigint), "rank world" (bigint), "country" (text), "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision)
  - Note: The GDP metric is 2011 GDP (PPP) in billions of USD.

Evidence 1: Iran’s recorded ranks and GDP value
Executed SQL:
SELECT "country", "rank mideast", "rank asia", "rank world", "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" 
FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
WHERE "country" ILIKE '%iran%';

Result:
- country: iran
- rank mideast: 1
- rank asia: 6
- rank world: 17
- 2011 GDP (PPP): 930.236 (billions of USD)

Evidence 2: Contextual rankings within the Middle East and Asia
Executed SQL (Top 5 by Middle East rank):
SELECT country, "rank mideast", "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE "rank mideast" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "rank mideast" ASC LIMIT 5;

Result:
- iran — 1 — 930.236
- saudi arabia — 2 — 677.663
- united arab emirates — 3 — 261.189
- israel — 4 — 235.446
- qatar — 5 — 181.912

Executed SQL (Top 10 by Asia rank):
SELECT "rank asia", country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE "rank asia" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "rank asia" ASC LIMIT 10;

Returned rows include:
- 6 — iran — 930.236
- 9 — saudi arabia — 677.663
- 18 — united arab emirates — 261.189
- 19 — israel — 235.446
- 21 — qatar — 181.912
- 22 — kuwait — 150.002
- 23 — iraq — 127.348
- 26 — syria — 107.803
- 29 — oman — 81.005
- 30 — yemen — 63.344

Assessment
- The table explicitly records Iran with rank mideast = 1 and rank asia = 6 for 2011 GDP (PPP). This directly supports both parts of the claim within this dataset.

Conclusion
- Both statements are supported by the available data (2011 GDP in PPP terms).

Assumptions and scope
- Metric: GDP (PPP), not nominal GDP.
- Year: 2011 (as per the dataset’s column name).
- Geographic groupings (Middle East, Asia) follow the dataset’s definitions. Rankings for other years or using nominal GDP may differ.
