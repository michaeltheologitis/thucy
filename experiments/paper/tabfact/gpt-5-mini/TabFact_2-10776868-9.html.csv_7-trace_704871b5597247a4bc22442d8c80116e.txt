Summary conclusion: In the available 1962 VFL season data, the South Melbourne vs Richmond match on 23 June 1962 did not draw the smallest crowd of the day; the smallest crowd that day was North Melbourne vs Hawthorn.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1962_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify South Melbourne vs Richmond match(es)
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", crowd, venue
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'south melbourne' AND "away team" = 'richmond')
   OR ("home team" = 'richmond' AND "away team" = 'south melbourne');
Result:
{"date":"23 june 1962","home team":"south melbourne","away team":"richmond","crowd":17000,"venue":"lake oval"}

2) List all matches on that date (23 june 1962)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", venue, crowd FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE date = '23 june 1962';
Results:
- melbourne vs st kilda — venue: mcg — crowd: 48952
- essendon vs geelong — venue: windy hill — crowd: 35000
- collingwood vs fitzroy — venue: victoria park — crowd: 26488
- carlton vs footscray — venue: princes park — crowd: 32400
- south melbourne vs richmond — venue: lake oval — crowd: 17000
- north melbourne vs hawthorn — venue: arden street oval — crowd: 8470

3) Compute the minimum crowd on that date
SQL:
SELECT "date", MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, COUNT(*) AS matches_on_date
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '23 june 1962'
GROUP BY "date";
Result:
{"date":"23 june 1962","matches_on_date":6,"min_crowd":8470}

4) Order matches that day by crowd to identify the smallest explicitly
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '23 june 1962'
ORDER BY crowd ASC;
Results (ascending by crowd):
1) north melbourne vs hawthorn — arden street oval — 8470
2) south melbourne vs richmond — lake oval — 17000
3) collingwood vs fitzroy — victoria park — 26488
4) carlton vs footscray — princes park — 32400
5) essendon vs geelong — windy hill — 35000
6) melbourne vs st kilda — mcg — 48952
