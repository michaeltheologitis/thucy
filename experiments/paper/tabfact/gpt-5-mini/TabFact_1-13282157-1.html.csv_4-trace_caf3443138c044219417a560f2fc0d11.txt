Claim interpreted: “99012 is the lowest reset point where the event is 56.” I interpret this as: In the table t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs, among rows with events = 56, the minimum of the column "reset points" equals 99012.

Data source and schema explored:
- Source: PostgreSQL database postgres_tabfact18 (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
  - Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (bigint), "player" (text), "country" (text), "points" (bigint), "events" (bigint), "reset points" (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Minimum "reset points" where events = 56
SQL:
SELECT MIN("reset points") AS min_reset_points
FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
WHERE events = 56;
Result: min_reset_points = NULL (indicates no matching rows).

2) Count rows where events = 56
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
WHERE events = 56;
Result: cnt = 0 (confirms there are no rows with events = 56).

3) Distinct events present (to verify 56 is absent)
SQL:
SELECT events, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
GROUP BY events
ORDER BY events ASC;
Results (events : count): 13 : 1; 18 : 1; 19 : 3; 21 : 2; 23 : 1; 25 : 1. (No 56 present.)

4) Check if any row has "reset points" = 99012 at all
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE "reset points" = 99012;
Result: match_count = 0 (99012 does not occur as a reset points value in this table).

Conclusion:
- There are zero rows with events = 56 in the dataset, so no minimum "reset points" exists for that condition. Additionally, the value 99012 does not appear in the "reset points" column anywhere. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Lowest reset point” was interpreted as the minimum value of the column named "reset points".
- “Event be 56” was interpreted as rows where the column "events" equals 56.
- The table t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs in postgres_tabfact18 is the intended source for verification.
