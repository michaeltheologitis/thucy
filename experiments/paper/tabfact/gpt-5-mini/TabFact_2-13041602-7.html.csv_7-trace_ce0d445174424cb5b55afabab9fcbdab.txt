Claim being checked: “there be 10 game in the 2005 milwaukee brewer season where 1 team score no point.” Interpreted as: the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season had 10 games in which one team was shut out (scored 0 runs).

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL (TabFact) database with a table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record)

First, understand table coverage
1) Total rows (games) in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result:
- total_games: 27

2) Distinct dates to see coverage period
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 200;
Result (abbrev.):
- september 1, september 2, …, through september 30 (various dates in September only)

3) Count of rows per date (ordered by day number) to confirm September-only scope
SQL:
SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY split_part(date,' ',2)::int;
Result:
- One game on each listed September date; table covers September only (27 games total)

Score format verification (needed to parse shutouts)
4) Inspect score formats
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT score FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY score LIMIT 200;
Result (examples):
- "4 - 11", "12 - 2", "0 - 7", "0 - 2", "2 - 0", "1 - 2 (10)", …
Inference: score is “BrewersScore - OpponentScore”, with optional extra-innings suffix like “(10)” after the opponent score.

Shutout counts (within the available data)
5) Total shutouts (either team scored 0) in this table
SQL:
SELECT
COUNT(*) AS total_shutouts
FROM (
  SELECT
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',1)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS brewers_score,
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',2)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS opp_score
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
) s
WHERE brewers_score = 0 OR opp_score = 0;
Result:
- total_shutouts: 4

6) Brewers shut out (Brewers scored 0)
SQL:
SELECT
COUNT(*) AS brewers_shutouts_against
FROM (
  SELECT
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',1)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS brewers_score,
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',2)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS opp_score
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
) s
WHERE brewers_score = 0;
Result:
- brewers_shutouts_against: 3

7) Opponent shut out (opponent scored 0)
SQL:
SELECT
COUNT(*) AS opponents_shutouts
FROM (
  SELECT
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',1)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS brewers_score,
    CAST(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score,'-',2)),'[^0-9].*$','') AS INTEGER) AS opp_score
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
) s
WHERE opp_score = 0;
Result:
- opponents_shutouts: 1

8) List the specific shutout games in this table
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE score LIKE '0 - %' OR score LIKE '% - 0' OR score LIKE '% - 0 (%' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- september 17 — astros — 0 - 7
- september 22 — cubs — 0 - 3
- september 25 — cardinals — 0 - 2
- september 29 — reds — 2 - 0

Conclusion
- The available dataset only covers September 2005 (27 games), not the full 2005 season (162 games). Within this September-only data, there are 4 shutout games (3 where Milwaukee was shut out, 1 where Milwaukee shut out the opponent). The claim of “10 games in the 2005 season where one team scored 0” is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- The “score” field is formatted as Brewers runs first, opponent runs second; this was corroborated by checking the “loss” pitcher on example rows.
- Each row represents one game; counting rows yields total games represented in the dataset.
- The conclusion is strictly based on the accessible table (September-only coverage). Without full-season data in this source, we cannot confirm a full-season total of 10 shutout games; the evidence we do have contradicts 10 for the covered period.
