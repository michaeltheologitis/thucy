Claim interpreted: The VCTP’s listed armament is a 20 mm (79in) Rh-202 autocannon, and it does not have the 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun that is listed for the VCRT.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database labeled “TabFact” with a public schema.
- Identified table: public.tam_tank with columns: vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt.

Evidence from data:
1) Full table inspection
- SQL executed:
  SELECT vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt FROM public.tam_tank;
- Relevant result row (Row 2):
  - vctp: 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon
  - vcrt: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun
  (Other columns in this row list the primary armament for other TAM family variants.)

2) Targeted retrieval of the armament row
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank WHERE vctp ILIKE '%autocannon%' OR vcrt ILIKE '%fn mag%';
- Result (single matching row):
  - vctp: 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon
  - vcrt: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun

Analysis:
- The table explicitly lists the VCTP with a 20 mm Rh-202 autocannon, while the VCRT is listed with a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. This supports the claim that the VCTP does not have the 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 “as the VCRT” (i.e., the VCTP’s listed armament is different from the VCRT’s listed armament).
- Note: The string “79in” appears in the data as given; while 20 mm is approximately 0.79 in, I rely on the dataset’s exact text as authoritative per instructions.

Assumptions made explicit:
- Interpreted the claim as a comparison of listed primary armaments for VCTP versus VCRT, not as a statement about any possible secondary/coaxial weapons on the VCTP. The verification is strictly based on the armament entries present in public.tam_tank.
