Claim interpreted: “All of the matches are on different dates.” I verified this against the available data in the only accessible table that contains match records.

Data source discovery
- Database: postgres_tabfact14 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1975_vfl_season (columns include: "home team", "away team", "venue", "crowd", and "date" [text])

Method
- Count total matches and distinct date values.
- Identify any dates that appear more than once.
- Check for NULL or empty date values.

Evidence with executed SQL and results
1) Total match count
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
- total_matches: 6

2a) Count of distinct non-NULL date values
SQL:
SELECT count(DISTINCT "date") AS distinct_non_null_dates FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
- distinct_non_null_dates: 1

2b) Rows where date IS NULL
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS rows_with_null_date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "date" IS NULL;
Result:
- rows_with_null_date: 0

2c) Rows where date is empty string
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS rows_with_empty_date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "date" = '';
Result:
- rows_with_empty_date: 0

2d) Distinct dates including a NULL marker
SQL:
SELECT count(DISTINCT COALESCE("date", '__NULL__')) AS distinct_including_null_marker FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
- distinct_including_null_marker: 1

3) Dates appearing more than once (descending count)
SQL:
SELECT "date", count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY "date" HAVING count(*)>1 ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- date: "7 june 1975", cnt: 6

4) Rows with NULL or empty dates (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","venue",crowd,"date" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "date" IS NULL OR "date" = '';
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion
- All 6 matches share the same date value "7 june 1975". Therefore, not every match is on a different date.

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to each row in public.t_1975_vfl_season.
- The “date” column is the authoritative date for each match. Values are treated as exact text for uniqueness (no normalization beyond exact string comparison was required).
