Summary of data sources and schema exploration:
- Discovered one relational source: TabFact (public schema). It contains a single table: public.ned_kelly_awards with columns: "year" (bigint), "best teenage / young adult" (text), "reader 's vote" (text), "best non - fiction" (text), and "lifetime achievement" (text).

Claim to verify:
- "na win the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998"

Evidence from the data:
1) List of all years with their lifetime achievement entries (ordered by year):
- Result excerpt shows: 1996: jon cleary; 1997: alan yates (aka carter brown ); 1998: na; 1999: peter corris; 2000: na; 2001: professor stephen knight; … ; 2011: na.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "year", "lifetime achievement" FROM public.ned_kelly_awards ORDER BY "year" ASC;

2) Earliest year where lifetime achievement is recorded as 'na' (case-insensitive): 1998.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_na_year FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE lower("lifetime achievement") = 'na';

3) Any 'na' entries before 1999:
- Result: 1998.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE lower("lifetime achievement") = 'na' AND year < 1999 ORDER BY year ASC;

Assessment:
- The data show that 'na' appears in the lifetime achievement column in 1998 (and again in 2000 and 2011). Therefore, it is not true that 'na' occurs only after 1998; it occurs in 1998 itself.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "na" literally as the text value 'na' in the "lifetime achievement" field (commonly used to denote not available/not awarded).
- Interpreted "only after the year 1998" strictly as years > 1998 (not including 1998).
