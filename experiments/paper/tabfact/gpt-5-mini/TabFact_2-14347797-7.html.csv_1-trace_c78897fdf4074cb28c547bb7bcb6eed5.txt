Claim to verify: “the score be 5 - 4 on february 24.”

Available data source
- TabFact database (public schema) with table t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season containing February game logs for the 2003–04 Philadelphia Flyers (columns: game, february, opponent, score, record, points).

Evidence
1) Inspect all rows to understand date/score fields
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, february, opponent, score, record, points FROM public.t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season ORDER BY game;
- Observation: “february” holds day-of-month integers; “score” holds results like “5 - 4”. Relevant rows:
  • february=21 → score: 5 - 4 (opponent: atlanta thrashers)
  • february=24 → score: 3 - 1 (opponent: chicago blackhawks)

2) What was the score on February 24?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, score FROM public.t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE february = 24;
- Result: opponent: chicago blackhawks; score: 3 - 1

3) On which date(s) was the score 5 - 4?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT february, opponent, score
  FROM public.t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season
  WHERE score ~ '^\s*5\s*[-–]\s*4\s*$'
  ORDER BY february;
- Result: February 21 — opponent: atlanta thrashers — score: 5 - 4

Conclusion
- The data show the Flyers’ game on February 24 finished 3 - 1 (vs. Chicago), not 5 - 4. A 5 - 4 score did occur, but on February 21 (vs. Atlanta), not on the 24th. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “february” is the day-of-month for February 2004 within the 2003–04 Flyers season log.
- The claim refers to this dataset’s context (Philadelphia Flyers 2003–04 season).
