Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the public schema. Only one relevant table was found: public.pocono_400, which contains race details including year, driver, laps, race time, and average speed (mph).
- Queried this table for Jeff Gordon in 1997 to verify laps completed and average speed.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Query to retrieve the key fields (year, driver, laps, race time, average speed):
SQL:
SELECT year, driver, laps, "race time", "average speed (mph)"
FROM public.pocono_400
WHERE year = 1997 AND driver ILIKE '%Jeff Gordon%';

Result:
- year: 1997
- driver: jeff gordon
- laps: 200
- race time: 3:34:33
- average speed (mph): 139.828

2) Query to retrieve the full row for context (including distance):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE year = 1997 AND driver ILIKE '%Jeff Gordon%';

Result:
- year: 1997
- date: june 8
- driver: jeff gordon
- team: hendrick motorsports
- manufacturer: chevrolet
- laps: 200
- -: 500 (804.672)
- race time: 3:34:33
- average speed (mph): 139.828
- report: report

Verification
- “finish 200 lap”: Supported. The data shows laps = 200 for Jeff Gordon in 1997 at this Pocono event.
- “average speed of 139.104 mph”: Not supported by the available data. The recorded average speed is 139.828 mph, not 139.104 mph. The difference (≈0.724 mph) exceeds any plausible rounding discrepancy.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct element (200 laps) with an incorrect one (average speed value). Based on the authoritative dataset accessible here, the correct average speed for Jeff Gordon’s 1997 200-lap Pocono race is 139.828 mph.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to Jeff Gordon’s 1997 Pocono 500 (200 laps) because the only available motorsports table is public.pocono_400, which records a 1997 entry for Jeff Gordon with 200 laps. If the claim intended a different 1997 race, that data is not present among accessible sources.
- Used case-insensitive matching for the driver name (ILIKE '%Jeff Gordon%').
