Claim to verify: "the nets' only win come at the air canada centre"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact13). Relevant table found: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season.
- Columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

Step 1: Inspect available rows to understand scope
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 10;

Result summary:
- The table contains 7 rows total, covering games 75–81 of the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season.
- Among these rows, the only win shown is game 77 (Apr 5) vs Minnesota, score "w 107 - 105 (ot)", location "prudential center 13461".
- One game at Air Canada Centre appears: game 80 (Apr 10) vs Toronto, score "l 92 - 99 (ot)", location "air canada centre 17755".

Executed SQL to confirm total rows:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Result: total_rows = 7

Step 2: Count wins and list their locations
Executed SQL (count wins):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower(score) LIKE 'w %' OR lower(score) LIKE 'w%';
Result: 1

Executed SQL (list wins and locations):
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower(score) LIKE 'w %' OR lower(score) LIKE 'w%';
Result:
- game: 77, date: april 5, team: minnesota, score: w 107 - 105 (ot), location attendance: prudential center 13461, record: 24 - 53

Step 3: Check games at Air Canada Centre and outcomes
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Air Canada Centre%';
Result:
- game: 80, date: april 10, team: toronto, score: l 92 - 99 (ot), location attendance: air canada centre 17755, record: 24 - 56

Findings
- Within the available data (games 75–81), the Nets have exactly one win, and it occurred at Prudential Center (home), not at Air Canada Centre.
- Their game at Air Canada Centre (vs Toronto) is recorded as a loss.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the accessible table. The only win in this dataset did not come at Air Canada Centre; the Air Canada Centre game was a loss.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "only win" relative to the scope of the available table (games 75–81) since this is the only authoritative data accessible.
- Determined wins/losses by the leading character in the score field ('w' or 'l').
- Matched the venue with a case-insensitive search for "Air Canada Centre" in the "location attendance" column.
