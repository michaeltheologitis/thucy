Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data sources and identified a relevant table for the 1993 New York Jets season.
- Inspected the schema to understand available fields.
- Queried the dataset to count games by venue and to specifically check occurrences of “robert f kennedy memorial stadium,” and to list the detailed record(s) for that venue.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL TabFact database (public schema) containing table t_1993_new_york_jets_season.

Schema details
- Table: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "game site" (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence 1: Distinct game sites and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT "game site", COUNT(*) AS games
FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season
GROUP BY "game site"
ORDER BY games DESC;

Result (site : number of games):
- the meadowlands : 8
- houston astrodome : 1
- robert f kennedy memorial stadium : 1
- rca dome : 1
- los angeles memorial coliseum : 1
- foxboro stadium : 1
- giants stadium : 1
- rich stadium : 1
- joe robbie stadium : 1

Evidence 2: Exact count of games at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE lower("game site") = 'robert f kennedy memorial stadium';

Result:
- count: 1

Evidence 3: Details of the RFK Stadium game
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE "game site" ILIKE '%robert f kennedy memorial stadium%';

Result:
- Week 15 — Date: 1993-12-11 — Opponent: Washington Redskins — Result: W 3 - 0 — Game site: robert f kennedy memorial stadium

Conclusion
- The data shows the New York Jets played exactly 1 game at Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium in the 1993 season, not 8. They played 8 games at “the meadowlands.” Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The table represents the full 1993 regular-season schedule for the New York Jets.
- Venue names are taken as-is from the "game site" field, and the database is authoritative within its scope.
