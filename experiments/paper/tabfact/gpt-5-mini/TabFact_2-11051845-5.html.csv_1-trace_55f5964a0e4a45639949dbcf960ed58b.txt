Claim assessed: "spiral galaxy have the least apparent magnitude"

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 with columns: ngc number, object type, constellation, right ascension ( j2000 ), declination ( j2000 ), apparent magnitude (double precision)

What I tested
- Identify which galaxy types are present in the table.
- Compare apparent magnitude statistics (min/avg/max) across those galaxy types.
- Inspect the actual rows to confirm.

Evidence 1: Galaxy types present
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "object type"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IS NOT NULL
  AND "object type" ILIKE '%galaxy%'
ORDER BY "object type";
Result:
- irregular galaxy
- spiral galaxy

Evidence 2: Apparent magnitude statistics by galaxy type
SQL executed:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_mag, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_mag, MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_mag
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%galaxy%'
  AND "apparent magnitude" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY "object type";
Results:
- irregular galaxy — count = 2, min = 14.0, avg = 14.25, max = 14.5
- spiral galaxy — count = 2, min = 8.7, avg = 10.3, max = 11.9

Evidence 3: Galaxy rows with magnitudes (for confirmation)
SQL executed:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%galaxy%'
  AND "apparent magnitude" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" ASC;
Results (ascending by apparent magnitude):
- NGC 5457 — spiral galaxy — 8.7
- NGC 5474 — spiral galaxy — 11.9
- NGC 5408 — irregular galaxy — 14.0
- NGC 5477 — irregular galaxy — 14.5

Interpretation
- On the astronomical magnitude scale, a smaller numeric apparent magnitude means a brighter object. In this dataset, spiral galaxies have smaller (i.e., “least”) apparent magnitude values than irregular galaxies, both in minimum and average, hence are brighter.
- Only two galaxy types (“spiral galaxy” and “irregular galaxy”) appear in this table for NGC objects 5001–6000 with non-null magnitudes; no other galaxy types (e.g., elliptical, lenticular) are present here. Thus, the conclusion is limited to the types represented in this dataset.

Conclusion
- Within this dataset, spiral galaxies have the least (smallest numeric) apparent magnitudes among the galaxy types present, supporting the claim in this context.

Assumptions and scope
- I interpret “least apparent magnitude” to mean the smallest numeric magnitude (i.e., brightest). If instead “least” were interpreted as faintest (largest magnitude number), the irregular galaxies in this dataset would have the “least brightness.”
- The verification is limited to the public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 table; broader generalization beyond this dataset is not assessed here.
