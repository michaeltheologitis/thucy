Claim interpreted: All of the constituencies (in the available dataset) have the SNP in 2nd place in 2003.

What I checked
- I explored the available database and found one relevant table: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007, which includes a column named "snp 's place 2003" indicating the SNP’s placement in 2003 for each listed constituency.
- I verified whether every row (constituency) in this table has the value "2nd" in that column.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of constituencies (rows) in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS constituency_count FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
Result:
- constituency_count = 11

2) Distribution of values in the column "snp 's place 2003"
SQL:
SELECT "snp 's place 2003" AS value, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
GROUP BY "snp 's place 2003"
ORDER BY count DESC, value;
Result:
- value: 2nd — count: 11
(Only one distinct value returned: "2nd")

3) Listing each constituency with its "snp 's place 2003" value
SQL:
SELECT "constituency", "snp 's place 2003" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 ORDER BY "constituency";
Sample of returned rows (full result contained 11 rows, all identical in the second column):
- aberdeen central — 2nd
- cumbernauld & kilsyth — 2nd
- dundee west — 2nd
- galloway & upper nithsdale — 2nd
- glasgow govan — 2nd
- kilmarnock & loudoun — 2nd
- linlithgow — 2nd
- paisley south — 2nd
- tweeddale , ettrick & lauderdale — 2nd
- west renfrewshire — 2nd
- western isles — 2nd

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (11 constituencies), every constituency has "2nd" recorded for "snp 's place 2003". The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "All of the constituency" refers to all constituencies present in the available table public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 (11 rows), not necessarily all constituencies in Scotland. The database did not expose a comprehensive 2003 results table for all constituencies beyond this dataset.
