Interpretation: You want to compute two differences and assign them labels: set 3 = 25 - 13 and total = 75 - 34.

Evidence and computation:
- Using the connected PostgreSQL data source, we computed both values directly via a SELECT expression (no table access required).

Executed SQL:
SELECT 25 - 13 AS set_3, 75 - 34 AS total;

Result:
- set_3 = 12
- total = 41

Conclusion: The arithmetic yields set 3 = 12 when the total = 41.

Assumptions:
- “set 3” is a label and represented as set_3 in the SQL alias.
- “be” is interpreted as equality (“=”).
- “the total” is a label for the result of 75 − 34.
