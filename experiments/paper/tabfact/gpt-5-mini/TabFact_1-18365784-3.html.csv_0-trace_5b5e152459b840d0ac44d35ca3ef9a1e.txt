Claim: “the train that arrive on 21.26 have depart on 21.08.”

Data source: TabFact database, public.my_info_table (columns: departure [text], going to [text], calling at [text], arrival [double precision], operator [text]).

Evidence
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT departure, arrival, "going to", "calling at", operator
  FROM public.my_info_table
  WHERE arrival = 21.26;

- Result (1 row):
  departure: 21.08
  arrival: 21.26
  going to: skegness
  calling at: wainfleet , skegness
  operator: gnr

Conclusion
- The record with arrival = 21.26 shows departure = 21.08. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “arrive on 21.26” as matching the numeric arrival value 21.26 in the dataset (i.e., 21:26).
