Claim to verify: "the match between south melbourne and richmond draw a bigger crowd than the game between hawthorn and north melbourne"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19)
- Relevant table: public.t_1962_vfl_season with columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Step 1: Confirm exact team name strings
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM (SELECT "home team" AS team FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season UNION SELECT "away team" AS team FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season) t ORDER BY team;
Result (relevant teams):
- "south melbourne"
- "richmond"
- "hawthorn"
- "north melbourne"

Step 2: Retrieve the 1962 matches for the two pairings and their crowds
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'south melbourne' AND "away team" = 'richmond')
   OR ("home team" = 'richmond' AND "away team" = 'south melbourne')
   OR ("home team" = 'hawthorn' AND "away team" = 'north melbourne')
   OR ("home team" = 'north melbourne' AND "away team" = 'hawthorn')
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- 23 june 1962 — south melbourne vs richmond — lake oval — crowd: 17000
- 23 june 1962 — north melbourne vs hawthorn — arden street oval — crowd: 8470

Step 3: Verify whether there are additional fixtures between the same pairings in 1962
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'south melbourne' AND "away team" = 'richmond')
   OR ("home team" = 'richmond' AND "away team" = 'south melbourne');
Result: match_count = 1

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'hawthorn' AND "away team" = 'north melbourne')
   OR ("home team" = 'north melbourne' AND "away team" = 'hawthorn');
Result: match_count = 1

Conclusion based on data
- South Melbourne vs Richmond (23 June 1962): 17,000 attendees
- North Melbourne vs Hawthorn (23 June 1962): 8,470 attendees
- Therefore, within the available 1962 VFL season data, the South Melbourne–Richmond match drew a larger crowd than the Hawthorn–North Melbourne game.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the accessible dataset (1962 VFL season table). I interpret the claim in the context of this dataset.
- Team names are matched exactly as stored (lowercase).
