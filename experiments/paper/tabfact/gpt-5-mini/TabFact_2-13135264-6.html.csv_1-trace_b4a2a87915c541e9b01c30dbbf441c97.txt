Scope and data discovery
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL source (TabFact, schema public) containing a sports table: public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season with columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record.

Schema sample check
- Pulled sample rows to confirm score format and content (score appears as "visitor_goals - home_goals").
SQL query executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season LIMIT 10;
Key returned samples (abbrev.):
- january 5 — visitor: nashville, score: 0 - 6, home: detroit

Verification steps and evidence
1) Compute the maximum number of goals scored by the home team in any game in the table.
SQL query executed:
SELECT MAX(CAST(TRIM(split_part(score, '-', 2)) AS INTEGER)) AS max_home_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE score ~ '^[0-9]+\s*-\s*[0-9]+$';
Result: max_home_goals = 6

2) List the game(s) where the home team scored that maximum to identify the team(s).
SQL query executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE CAST(TRIM(split_part(score, '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) = (
  SELECT MAX(CAST(TRIM(split_part(score, '-', 2)) AS INTEGER))
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE score ~ '^[0-9]+\s*-\s*[0-9]+$'
)
ORDER BY date;
Result row: {date: january 5, visitor: nashville, score: 0 - 6, home: detroit, attendance: 20066, record: 26 - 12 - 4 - 1}

3) Confirm which team(s) reached the overall maximum and that it is unique in this dataset.
SQL query executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT home, CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) AS home_goals
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
), maxes AS (
  SELECT home, MAX(home_goals) AS max_home_goals
  FROM parsed
  GROUP BY home
)
SELECT home FROM maxes WHERE max_home_goals = (
  SELECT MAX(max_home_goals) FROM maxes
) ORDER BY home;
Result: detroit

Conclusion
- The highest home team score in this dataset is 6 goals, and it was achieved by Detroit. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "Detroit" refers to the team names present in public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season.
- "Highest home team score" means the maximum number of goals scored by the home team in any single game recorded in this table.
- "6 point" is interpreted as 6 goals.
