Claim to verify: “the tournament that take place on April 26, 2004 be on grass.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: postgres_tabfact15 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.alex_bogdanovic with columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), "opponent in the final" (text), score (text)

What I looked for
- Any entry whose date corresponds to April 26, 2004, and the surface listed for that entry.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Check for an exact text match of the date:
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE date = 'April 26, 2004';
Result:
[{"count":0}]
Interpretation: No row exactly matching the string “April 26, 2004”.

2) Fuzzy match for April 2004 entries and inspect the details:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE date ILIKE '%April%' AND date ILIKE '%2004%';
Result:
[{"date":"26 april 2004","opponent in the final":"gaël monfils","score":"4 - 6 , 3 - 6","surface":"carpet","tournament":"glasgow , great britain f1"}]
Interpretation: The table contains an entry for the same calendar date (26 April 2004); the surface is listed as “carpet,” not grass.

3) Inspect all stored date values for completeness and verify the April 26, 2004 row’s surface:
SQL:
SELECT date, surface FROM public.alex_bogdanovic ORDER BY date;
Result:
[{"date":"16 april 2007","surface":"hard"},
 {"date":"2 june 2003","surface":"grass"},
 {"date":"2 october 2006","surface":"hard"},
 {"date":"24 september 2012","surface":"hard"},
 {"date":"26 april 2004","surface":"carpet"},
 {"date":"4 april 2011","surface":"hard"},
 {"date":"5 july 2004","surface":"grass"},
 {"date":"8 april 2013","surface":"hard"}]
Interpretation: There is a single row for 26 April 2004 in this dataset, and its surface is “carpet.”

Conclusion
- The available authoritative data shows that the tournament dated 26 April 2004 (same calendar date as April 26, 2004) was played on carpet, not grass. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim as referring to the tournament entry in the available dataset that corresponds to the calendar date April 26, 2004.
- I assume the “surface” field in the table accurately reflects the playing surface for that tournament entry.
- The dataset available (alex_bogdanovic table) is treated as the authoritative source per instructions.
