Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Discovered one PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact31 (public schema).

Step 2: Inspect schema to locate relevant tables
- Table identified: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
  - Columns: goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision), team (text)
  - This appears to contain goalkeeper statistics by team for the 2008–09 Segunda División B season.

Step 3: Retrieve the row for Atlético Ciudad and verify matches and average
Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, team, matches, goals, average
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE lower(team) = lower('Atlético Ciudad');

Result:
- goalkeeper: miguel zapata
- team: atlético ciudad
- matches: 28
- goals: 17
- average: 0.61

Step 4: Cross-check that the stored average aligns with goals/matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT goals, matches, average AS stored_average, (goals::double precision / NULLIF(matches,0)) AS computed_avg
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b
WHERE team = 'atlético ciudad';

Result:
- goals: 17
- matches: 28
- stored_average: 0.61
- computed_avg: 0.6071428571428571

Findings
- The dataset contains exactly one row for Atlético Ciudad, with matches = 28 and average = 0.61 for goalkeeper Miguel Zapata.
- The computed average (goals/matches) is approximately 0.6071, which rounds to 0.61, matching the stored value.
- The claim that the average is “never below 0.61” is satisfied at the season level because the recorded average equals 0.61 (i.e., it is not below 0.61). The dataset does not provide per-match averages, so “never below” can only be assessed against the season-level average recorded.

Conclusion
- The available data supports that Atlético Ciudad’s goalkeeper recorded an average of 0.61 across 28 matches, which is not below 0.61.

Assumptions
- “Average” refers to the column named average in the identified table (a season-level statistic), and “his” refers to the listed goalkeeper for Atlético Ciudad (Miguel Zapata).
- The claim is evaluated at the season level because no per-match averages are available in the dataset.
