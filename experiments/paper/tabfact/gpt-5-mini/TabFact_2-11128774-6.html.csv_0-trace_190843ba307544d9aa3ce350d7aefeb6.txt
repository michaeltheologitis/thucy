Claim to verify: "ny ranger be the visitor to vancouver on february 24"

Interpretation: Determine whether the New York Rangers were the visiting team in a Vancouver home game on February 24 in the available Vancouver Canucks season dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17)
- Relevant table: public.t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season (columns: date [text], visitor [text], score [text], home [text], decision [text], attendance [bigint], record [text])

Evidence gathered (with executed SQL)
1) Understand table contents and date formatting
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, decision, attendance, record
FROM public.t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season
LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- {"date":"february 24","visitor":"ny rangers","home":"vancouver","score":"4 - 5","decision":"whitmore","attendance":16150,"record":"34 - 19 - 8"}
Observation: Dates are stored as lowercase strings like "february 24"; team names are lowercase.

2) Direct verification for February 24 with Vancouver as home
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home FROM public.t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season WHERE date ILIKE '%February 24%' AND home ILIKE '%Vancouver%';
Result row returned:
- {"date":"february 24","visitor":"ny rangers","score":"4 - 5","home":"vancouver"}

Conclusion
- The table explicitly shows that on "february 24" the visitor was "ny rangers" and the home team was "vancouver". This supports the claim that the New York Rangers were the visiting team to Vancouver on February 24.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the dataset we have: the 1992–93 Vancouver Canucks season table in the TabFact database. No year was specified in the claim; verification is grounded in this available season dataset.
