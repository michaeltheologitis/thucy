Claim interpreted: “Gary Beach was one of four nominees for a Tony Award.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact/postgres_tabfact15) with a public schema.
- Schema inspection revealed one relevant table: public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical(year bigint, award text, category text, nominee text, result text), which records award-related entries for the musical La Cage aux Folles.

Evidence from data:
1) List all Tony Award entries for La Cage aux Folles
- SQL executed:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE award ILIKE '%Tony%' ORDER BY year, category, nominee;
- Results:
  - year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best choreography, nominee: jerry mitchell, result: won
  - year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best costume design, nominee: william ivey long, result: nominated
  - year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best performance by a leading actor in a musical, nominee: gary beach, result: nominated
  - year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best revival of a musical, nominee: best revival of a musical, result: won

2) Confirm Gary Beach’s Tony nomination in this dataset
- SQL executed:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE nominee ILIKE 'gary beach' AND award ILIKE '%Tony%';
- Result:
  - year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best performance by a leading actor in a musical, nominee: gary beach, result: nominated

3) Count Tony Award entries in 2005 for this musical (to verify “four”)
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND award ILIKE '%Tony%';
- Result: cnt = 4

Analysis:
- The dataset shows La Cage aux Folles had four Tony Award entries in 2005, and Gary Beach is one of the nominees among those entries. Interpreting “one of four nominee[s] for a Tony Award” as referring to the musical receiving four Tony nominations in 2005, the data fully supports the claim.
- If the intended meaning was “one of four nominees in his Tony category that year,” this table cannot confirm the total number of category-wide nominees because it only contains entries for La Cage aux Folles, not nominees from other productions. However, the dataset does confirm that Gary Beach was a Tony nominee in 2005.

Conclusion: The data verifies that Gary Beach was among the four Tony Award nominations associated with La Cage aux Folles in 2005.

Assumptions due to ambiguity:
- I interpreted the claim as: “In 2005, La Cage aux Folles received four Tony Award nominations, and Gary Beach was one of those nominees.”
- I treated all winners as nominees for counting nominations, consistent with awards terminology (winners are selected from the pool of nominees).
