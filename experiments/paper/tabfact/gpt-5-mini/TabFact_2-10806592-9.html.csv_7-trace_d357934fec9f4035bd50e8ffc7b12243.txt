Final determination: Carlton had the highest score on 18 June 1938, not the second-highest. The second-highest was Melbourne.

Assumptions made
- “the game that happen on the 18th of June” refers to all matches recorded on 18 june 1938 in the t_1938_vfl_season table. There were multiple matches that day; I interpreted “second highest score team” as the team with the second-highest points across all teams that played on that date.
- Points were parsed as the integer in parentheses of the score text (e.g., 16.25 (121) -> 121).
