Summary conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. For the only episode with series = 9 in the available dataset, the production code is 209, not 208.0. Additionally, production code 208 corresponds to an episode in series 8.

Evidence and executed SQL

1) Retrieve production code(s) for series = 9
Executed SQL:
SELECT "production code", episode, "episode title" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 9 ORDER BY episode;
Result:
- episode: 35, episode title: the all - stars, production code: 209

2) Count how many rows have series = 9
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_series_9 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 9;
Result:
- count_series_9 = 1

3) Check if any row has series = 9 and production code = 208
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "series" = 9 AND "production code" = 208;
Result:
- cnt = 0

4) Inspect any rows with production code = 208 (any series)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "episode", "series", "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "production code" = 208;
Result:
- episode: 34, series: 8, episode title: rocket 's decent, original air date: 27 april 2008, production code: 208

Interpretation
- The only series 9 episode has production code 209, not 208 (or 208.0). The value 208 is associated with a series 8 episode.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “208.0” as the numeric value 208.
- Interpreted “the episode with series 9” to mean any episode(s) where the series column equals 9 in the provided my_info_table.
