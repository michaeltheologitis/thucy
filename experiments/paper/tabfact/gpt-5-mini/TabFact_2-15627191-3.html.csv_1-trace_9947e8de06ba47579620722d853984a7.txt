Claim to verify: “both the 2010 and 2011 kids' choice award nominate cole sprouse for the favorite tv actor category.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL instance (public schema).

Schema used:
- Table: public.the_suite_life_on_deck
  - Columns: year (bigint), award (text), category (text), recipient (text), result (text)
  - This denormalized table stores award records (ceremony, category, nominee, outcome, year).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Queryed the awards table for Cole Sprouse nominations in 2010 and 2011 for Favorite TV Actor at the Kids’ Choice Awards.

Exact executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, recipient, result
FROM public.the_suite_life_on_deck
WHERE recipient ILIKE 'Cole Sprouse'
  AND category ILIKE 'Favorite TV Actor'
  AND award ILIKE '%Kids%'
  AND year IN (2010, 2011)
ORDER BY year;

Query results returned:
- year: 2010, award: 2010 kids' choice awards, category: favorite tv actor, recipient: cole sprouse, result: nominated
- year: 2011, award: 2011 kids' choice awards, category: favorite tv actor, recipient: cole sprouse, result: nominated

Analysis:
- The database contains explicit records showing Cole Sprouse as “nominated” for the “Favorite TV Actor” category at the Kids’ Choice Awards for both 2010 and 2011. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) was used for recipient, category, and award name to capture formatting variations (e.g., “Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards” vs. “kids' choice awards”).
- The “award” field containing “kids' choice awards” is treated as the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards.
