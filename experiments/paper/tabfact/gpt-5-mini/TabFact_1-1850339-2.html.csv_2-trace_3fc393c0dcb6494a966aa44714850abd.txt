Claim to verify: "an army - navy game will be play on 10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table identified: public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy
  - Columns: season (bigint), "trophy winner" (text), "air force - navy score" (text), "air force - army score" (text), "army - navy score" (text)

Evidence retrieved:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "army - navy score", "trophy winner", "air force - navy score", "air force - army score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 2016;

- Query result:
  { "season": 2016,
    "army - navy score": "10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)",
    "trophy winner": "tbd",
    "air force - navy score": "tbd",
    "air force - army score": "tbd"
  }

Analysis:
- The record for season 2016 explicitly states: "10 dec 2016 at baltimore , md (m&t bank stadium)" in the "army - navy score" field. While labeled as a score field, for 2016 it contains the scheduled date and venue, directly matching the claim’s date (10 Dec 2016) and location (Baltimore, MD).
- The accompanying TBD fields indicate the game had not yet been played at the time of data entry, which aligns with the phrasing "will be play" (i.e., future event from the data’s perspective).

Conclusion: The data supports that the Army–Navy football game was scheduled to be played on 10 Dec 2016 in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium).

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Army–Navy college football game between Army and Navy.
- Relied solely on the public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy table as the authoritative source available in this environment.
