Claim to verify: “tiger wood score a 211 placing 5th.”

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result summary: One accessible PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with table t_2002_u_s_open_golf.

Step 2 — Inspect schema
- Tool: schema_query
- Query: List tables and describe columns of t_2002_u_s_open_golf
- Result: Table t_2002_u_s_open_golf(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text)

Step 3 — Check Tiger Woods’ placement and score
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, place, score, "to par" FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Tiger%';
- Result:
  - player: tiger woods
  - place: 1
  - score: 67 + 68 + 70 = 205
  - to par: - 5
- Evidence: In this dataset, Tiger Woods is in 1st place with a cumulative score of 205 (after three rounds), not 211 nor 5th.

Step 4 — Check whether any 211 scores correspond to 5th place and who they are
- Tool: nl_query_traceable
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = '5' OR score LIKE '%211%';
- Results (matching rows):
  - place: t5; player: robert allenby; country: australia; score: 74 + 70 + 67 = 211; to par: + 1
  - place: t5; player: pádraig harrington; country: ireland; score: 70 + 68 + 73 = 211; to par: + 1
  - place: t5; player: billy mayfair; country: united states; score: 69 + 74 + 68 = 211; to par: + 1
- Additional check (exact place '5'):
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_place_eq_5 FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = '5';
  Result: 0
- Evidence: A score of 211 corresponds to T5 (tie for 5th) for Allenby, Harrington, and Mayfair—not Tiger Woods.

Conclusion
- The available authoritative dataset for the 2002 U.S. Open shows Tiger Woods at 205 and in 1st place. Players at 211 are tied for 5th, but none is Tiger Woods. The claim “tiger wood score a 211 placing 5th” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The table t_2002_u_s_open_golf represents the 54-hole leaderboard (three rounds), as suggested by the score formatting (e.g., “67 + 68 + 70 = 205”) and to-par values.
- The claim was interpreted as referring to this tournament context because it is the only available relevant data source.
