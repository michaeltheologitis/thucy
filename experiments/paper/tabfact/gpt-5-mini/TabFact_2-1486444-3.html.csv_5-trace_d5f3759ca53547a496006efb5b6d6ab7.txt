Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that the fight against Caol Uno occurred at DREAM 11 and ended at 5:00. I verified this against the available fight record data for Joachim Hansen.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with a public schema is available.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Result: Detected table public.joachim_hansen_fighter (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location), containing per-fight records for Joachim Hansen.

Evidence 1: Hansen vs Caol Uno
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, time, round, method, res
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'caol uno';
- Result:
  • opponent: caol uno | event: deep - 13 | time: 4:48 | round: 3 | method: ko (knee) | res: win
- Finding: The Caol Uno fight took place at “DEEP - 13,” not DREAM 11, and ended at 4:48 of round 3 (not 5:00).

Evidence 2: Fights at DREAM 11
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, time, round, method, res
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE lower(event) LIKE '%dream 11%';
- Result:
  • opponent: shinya aoki | event: dream 11 | time: 4:56 | round: 2 | method: submission (armbar) | res: loss
- Finding: Joachim Hansen’s fight at DREAM 11 was against Shinya Aoki, ended at 4:56 of round 2, not against Caol Uno and not at 5:00.

Evidence 3: Any fights that ended at exactly 5:00
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, event, time, round, method, res
  FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
  WHERE time = '5:00';
- Result summary (12 rows): Includes opponents such as Mitsuhiro Ishida (DREAM: Fight for Japan!), Bibiano Fernandes (DREAM 13), Eddie Alvarez (DREAM 3), Kotetsu Boku (DREAM 1), etc. None are against Caol Uno, and none are at “DREAM 11.”
- Finding: No 5:00 fight involves Caol Uno or the event DREAM 11.

Conclusion
- The data shows: (1) Hansen vs Caol Uno occurred at DEEP 13 and ended at 4:48 of round 3; (2) Hansen’s fight at DREAM 11 was vs Shinya Aoki and ended at 4:56 of round 2; (3) No recorded fights at exactly 5:00 involve Caol Uno or DREAM 11. Therefore, the claim that “Dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of Caol Uno” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- I interpreted the claim as referring to Joachim Hansen’s bout history (the only available dataset) and as asserting that the Caol Uno fight was at DREAM 11 and ended at 5:00. All checks were performed within the public.joachim_hansen_fighter table.
