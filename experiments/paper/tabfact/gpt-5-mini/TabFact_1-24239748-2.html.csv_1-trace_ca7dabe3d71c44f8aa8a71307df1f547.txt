Summary of verification
- Interpreted claim: “Vest county makes 6.270.2 in export,” i.e., Vest has exports of 6,270.2 (likely million USD).

Data sources explored
- Discovered one PostgreSQL data source with a single table in the public schema: public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade.
- Relevant columns: county, exports (us mil), percent of total exports, imports (us mil), percent of total imports.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Full table inspection
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade;
- Pertinent result row:
  county: vest; exports (us mil): 6270.2; imports (us mil): 6597.6; percent of total exports: 15.0 %; percent of total imports: 9.9 %.

2) Targeted lookup for “vest”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "exports (us mil)", "imports (us mil)" FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade WHERE lower(county) = 'vest';
- Result:
  Exports (US mil): 6270.2; Imports (US mil): 6597.6.

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists “vest” with exports equal to 6270.2 in the column labeled “exports (us mil),” i.e., 6,270.2 million USD.
- The claim’s numeric formatting “6.270.2” appears to be a punctuation/formatting variant of 6,270.2; the value matches the data.

Conclusion
- The claim that Vest has 6,270.2 in exports is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Vest county” refers to the row labeled “vest” in the provided table.
- The unit intended by the claim is millions of US dollars, matching the column label “exports (us mil).”
- Minor formatting differences (e.g., use of dots as thousands/decimal separators) are treated as non-substantive.
