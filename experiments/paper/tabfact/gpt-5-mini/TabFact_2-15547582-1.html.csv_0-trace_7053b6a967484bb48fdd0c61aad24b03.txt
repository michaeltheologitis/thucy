Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.members_of_the_7th_seanad
- Columns include: party (text), administrative panel (bigint), agricultural panel (bigint), cultural and educational panel (bigint), industrial and commercial panel (bigint), labour panel (bigint), national university of ireland (bigint), university of dublin (bigint), nominated by the taoiseach (bigint), total (bigint)

Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as: “There are zero rows (nil) in members_of_the_7th_seanad that simultaneously satisfy: labour panel > 1, nominated by the taoiseach < 11, and cultural and educational panel < 0.”

Evidence
1) Direct count of rows matching the stated conditions
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.members_of_the_7th_seanad WHERE "labour panel" > 1 AND "nominated by the taoiseach" < 11 AND "cultural and educational panel" < 0;
- Result: count = 0

2) Context: value ranges for the relevant columns
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN("cultural and educational panel") AS min_cult_edu, MAX("cultural and educational panel") AS max_cult_edu,
       MIN("labour panel") AS min_labour, MAX("labour panel") AS max_labour,
       MIN("nominated by the taoiseach") AS min_nom, MAX("nominated by the taoiseach") AS max_nom
FROM public.members_of_the_7th_seanad;
- Result row: { min_cult_edu: 0, max_cult_edu: 5, min_labour: 1, max_labour: 11, min_nom: 0, max_nom: 11 }
- Notably, the minimum “cultural and educational panel” is 0, so the condition “cultural and educational panel < 0” can never be satisfied, guaranteeing the count above is 0.

Conclusion
- The data shows there are no rows meeting all three conditions. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The phrase “there be nil industrial and commercial panel that have …” is taken to mean “there are zero rows in the table that satisfy the listed conditions,” without imposing any additional filter on the “industrial and commercial panel” column itself.
- Column names with spaces are interpreted exactly as listed in the schema (quoted identifiers in SQL).
