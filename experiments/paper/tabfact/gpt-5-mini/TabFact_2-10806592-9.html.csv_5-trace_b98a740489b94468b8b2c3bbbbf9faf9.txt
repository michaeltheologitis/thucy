Claim to verify: "only 2 team (hawthorn and south melbourne) score more than 10"

Data source discovery
- Connected database: postgres_tabfact4 (public schema)
- Table available: public.t_1938_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date" (scores stored as text in the format goals.behinds (total points))

Step 1 — Inspect the available rows and score format
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season LIMIT 50;

Observed rows (all 6 matches, all on 18 june 1938):
- geelong — 11.23 (89) vs hawthorn — 6.13 (49)
- fitzroy — 16.12 (108) vs south melbourne — 8.8 (56)
- st kilda — 14.12 (96) vs melbourne — 16.16 (112)
- richmond — 15.14 (104) vs essendon — 15.9 (99)
- footscray — 13.9 (87) vs collingwood — 10.5 (65)
- north melbourne — 11.5 (71) vs carlton — 16.25 (121)

Step 2 — Parse scores and test multiple reasonable interpretations of “score more than 10”
Interpretation A: goals > 10 in a team’s match entry
Executed SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, "home team score" AS score_text,
    split_part("home team score", '.', 1)::int AS goals,
    split_part(split_part("home team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds,
    split_part(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, "away team score" AS score_text,
    split_part("away team score", '.', 1)::int AS goals,
    split_part(split_part("away team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds,
    split_part(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS entries_with_goals_gt_10 FROM parsed WHERE goals > 10;

Result: entries_with_goals_gt_10 = 9

Executed SQL (teams with goals > 10 at least once):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, split_part("home team score", '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, split_part("away team score", '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM parsed WHERE goals > 10 ORDER BY team;

Result teams: carlton, essendon, fitzroy, footscray, geelong, melbourne, north melbourne, richmond, st kilda

Finding: Many teams scored more than 10 goals; Hawthorn and South Melbourne did not (they had 6 and 8 goals respectively).

Interpretation B: behinds > 10 in a team’s match entry
Executed SQL (count):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, split_part(split_part("home team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, split_part(split_part("away team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS entries_with_behinds_gt_10 FROM parsed WHERE behinds > 10;

Result: entries_with_behinds_gt_10 = 7

Executed SQL (teams with behinds > 10 at least once):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, split_part(split_part("home team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, split_part(split_part("away team score", '.', 2), ' ', 1)::int AS behinds
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM parsed WHERE behinds > 10 ORDER BY team;

Result teams: carlton, fitzroy, geelong, hawthorn, melbourne, richmond, st kilda

Finding: Several teams had behinds > 10; Hawthorn is included, but South Melbourne is not (it had 8.8). So “only Hawthorn and South Melbourne” is not correct under this interpretation.

Interpretation C: total points > 10 in a team’s match entry
Executed SQL (count):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, split_part(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, split_part(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS entries_with_total_gt_10 FROM parsed WHERE total_points > 10;

Result: entries_with_total_gt_10 = 12

Executed SQL (teams with total points > 10 at least once):
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team, split_part(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team, split_part(split_part("away team score", '(', 2), ')', 1)::int AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM parsed WHERE total_points > 10 ORDER BY team;

Result teams: carlton, collingwood, essendon, fitzroy, footscray, geelong, hawthorn, melbourne, north melbourne, richmond, south melbourne, st kilda

Finding: Every team scored more than 10 total points, so it is not limited to only two teams.

Conclusion
- Under all reasonable interpretations of “score more than 10” (goals, behinds, or total points) using the available 1938 VFL round data, the statement is contradicted by the data. In particular, Hawthorn and South Melbourne are not the only teams exceeding 10 in any of these metrics; for goals > 10 they are not among those teams at all.

Assumptions noted
- Scores are parsed as goals.behinds (total points) per the observed format.
- Each team’s performance is evaluated per match entry (home and away considered separately).
- The dataset contains one round (6 matches) dated 18 June 1938; the claim is evaluated against this available data.
