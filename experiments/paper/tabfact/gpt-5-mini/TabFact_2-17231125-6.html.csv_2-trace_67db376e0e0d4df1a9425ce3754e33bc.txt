Data sources explored
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (public schema) containing table public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf, which holds data about the 1988 U.S. Open (golf).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any player matching “fred” or “couple” (case-insensitive) and view their score
SQL:
SELECT "player", "country", "place", "score", "to par" AS to_par
FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf
WHERE lower("player") LIKE '%fred%' OR lower("player") LIKE '%couple%';

Result:
- player: fred couples; country: united states; place: 8; score: 72 + 67 + 71 = 210; to_par: - 3

2) Extract the numeric total from Fred Couples’ score string and test whether it is greater than 210
2a) Confirm the row and raw score string for Fred Couples
SQL:
SELECT player, score FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Fred Couples%';

Result:
- player: fred couples; score: 72 + 67 + 71 = 210

2b) Parse the total from the score string and compare to 210
SQL:
SELECT score, regexp_replace(score, '^.*=\s*','') AS total_text, regexp_replace(score, '^.*=\s*','')::integer AS total_int, (regexp_replace(score, '^.*=\s*','')::integer > 210) AS greater_than_210 FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Fred Couples%';

Result:
- score: 72 + 67 + 71 = 210; total_text: 210; total_int: 210; greater_than_210: false

Assessment
- The table records Fred Couples’ score as 210 (from “72 + 67 + 71 = 210”). The comparison test shows 210 is not greater than 210. Therefore, the claim that “fred couple have a score larger than 210” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “fred couple” as the golfer Fred Couples.
- Interpreted “score” as the numeric total shown in the score field for the 1988 U.S. Open dataset.
- Interpreted “larger than 210” as a strict numeric comparison (> 210).
