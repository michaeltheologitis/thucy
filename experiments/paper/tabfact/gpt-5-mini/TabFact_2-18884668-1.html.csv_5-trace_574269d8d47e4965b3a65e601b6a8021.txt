Claim assessed: “the elector bosone be from rome and receive the cardinalatial order and title of the cardinal - priest of s anastasia.”

Findings grounded in data:
1) Identify “bosone” and retrieve his recorded details
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT elector, nationality, "cardinalatial order and title" FROM papal_election_1119 WHERE lower(elector) LIKE '%boson%' OR lower(elector) LIKE '%boso%' OR lower(elector) LIKE '%bosone%';
- Result:
  {"elector":"bosone", "nationality":"italy", "cardinalatial order and title":"cardinal - priest of s anastasia"}

- Executed SQL (full row for confirmation):
  SELECT * FROM papal_election_1119 WHERE elector = 'bosone';
- Result:
  - elector: bosone
  - nationality: italy
  - cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s anastasia
  - elevated: circa 1116
  - elevator: paschal ii

Interpretation: The dataset explicitly records Bosone’s cardinalatial order and title as “cardinal - priest of s anastasia,” supporting that part of the claim. His nationality is recorded as “italy,” not “rome.”

2) Check how the dataset denotes electors from Rome (for context)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT nationality FROM papal_election_1119 ORDER BY nationality;
- Result (distinct nationalities): crema; fagnano; germany; italy; marsica; pisa; rome

- Executed SQL (which electors are labeled ‘rome’):
  SELECT elector, nationality, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator
  FROM papal_election_1119
  WHERE nationality = 'rome'
  ORDER BY elector;
- Results (3 rows):
  1) corrado de suburra — nationality: rome — cardinal - priest of s pudenziana — elevated: ca 1111 - 1114 — elevator: paschal ii
  2) gregorio papareschi , canreglat — nationality: rome — cardinal - deacon of s angelo in pescheria — elevated: circa 1088 (or 1116) — elevator: urban ii (or paschal ii )
  3) pietro pierleoni — nationality: rome — cardinal - deacon of ss cosma e damiano — elevated: ca 1106 - 1116 — elevator: paschal ii

Interpretation: The dataset uses the value “rome” in the nationality field for some electors. Bosone’s entry is explicitly “italy,” indicating that within this dataset he is not recorded as being from Rome.

Conclusion:
- True: Bosone held the cardinalatial order and title “cardinal - priest of s anastasia.”
- Not supported/contradicted by this dataset: Bosone being “from Rome.” The nationality recorded for Bosone is “italy,” and the dataset does label some others specifically as “rome,” suggesting Bosone is not designated as Roman here.

Assumptions:
- “Elector bosone” refers to the entry “bosone” in the papal_election_1119 table (context: the 1119 papal election). The dataset is treated as authoritative per instructions. Spelling/letter case normalized via case-insensitive search.
