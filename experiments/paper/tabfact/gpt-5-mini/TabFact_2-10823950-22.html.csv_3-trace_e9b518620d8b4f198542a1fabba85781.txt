Scope and data sources
- Explored available data sources and found a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: t_1981_vfl_season. This table contains match-level records for the 1981 VFL season, including home/away teams and a crowd (attendance) field.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Initial check (exact-case away team = 'Melbourne' and crowd = 7912)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE "away team" = 'Melbourne' AND "crowd" = 7912;
- Result: [{"match_count": 0}]
- Note: This suggested a case-sensitivity issue in team naming.

2) Direct search for crowd = 7912 to identify the specific match
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "date", "venue", "crowd"
FROM t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE "crowd" = 7912
ORDER BY "date";
- Result:
  - home team: hawthorn
  - away team: melbourne
  - date: 29 august 1981
  - venue: princes park
  - crowd: 7912

Interpretation
- The returned record shows Melbourne (stored as lowercase 'melbourne') was the away team in a match with a recorded crowd of 7,912 at Princes Park on 29 August 1981 versus Hawthorn. This directly supports the claim that a crowd of 7,912 attended Melbourne’s away game (at least in this instance from the 1981 VFL season data).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data: there is a Melbourne away game with a crowd of 7,912 in the 1981 VFL season.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “Melbourne” as the Melbourne Football Club in the 1981 VFL season (the only available dataset). Team names in the table are lowercase; comparisons are case-sensitive.
