Claim: The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Royals.

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
- Columns used: date (text), opponent (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Find the minimum attendance in the table
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_att FROM t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season;
Result:
- min_att = 20809

2) Retrieve the game(s) with that minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE attendance = 20809 ORDER BY date;
Result:
- date: may 3, opponent: royals, attendance: 20809

Conclusion:
- The lowest attendance recorded in May 1991 is 20,809, and that game (May 3) was against the Royals. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- The table t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season contains May 1991 games for the Toronto Blue Jays (dates stored as text like "may 3").
- "royal" in the claim refers to the Kansas City Royals (listed as "royals" in the data).
