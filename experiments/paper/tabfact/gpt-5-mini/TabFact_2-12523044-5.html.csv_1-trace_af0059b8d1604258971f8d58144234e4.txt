Claim interpreted: “Pádraig Harrington is the only player from Northern Ireland.”

Data sources discovered
- TabFact database (public schema) containing table t_2006_u_s_open_golf with columns: place, player, country, score, "to par".

Evidence 1: Pádraig Harrington’s listed country in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Harrington%';
- Result:
  place: t5; player: pádraig harrington; country: ireland; score: 70 + 72 = 142; to par: + 2
- Finding: Harrington is listed as “ireland,” not “northern ireland.”

Evidence 2: Players from Northern Ireland in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country, place FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(country) = 'northern ireland';
- Result:
  player: graeme mcdowell; country: northern ireland; place: t7
- Finding: There is at least one player from Northern Ireland (Graeme McDowell) in this dataset.

Evidence 3 (corroboration): All players from the island of Ireland categories
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(country) IN ('ireland','northern ireland') ORDER BY lower(country), lower(player);
- Result rows:
  - pádraig harrington — ireland
  - graeme mcdowell — northern ireland
- Finding: Confirms Harrington is from Ireland (Republic) and that McDowell is from Northern Ireland.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate in two ways within this dataset: (1) Pádraig Harrington is not from Northern Ireland; he is listed as from Ireland (Republic). (2) There is at least one player from Northern Ireland (Graeme McDowell), so Harrington could not be the only one even if he were from Northern Ireland.

Assumptions
- Scope interpreted as the available dataset (t_2006_u_s_open_golf), which lists competitors and their countries for the 2006 U.S. Open (golf). Names and countries are taken as authoritative within this data source.
- Case-insensitive matching used for player name and country where appropriate.
