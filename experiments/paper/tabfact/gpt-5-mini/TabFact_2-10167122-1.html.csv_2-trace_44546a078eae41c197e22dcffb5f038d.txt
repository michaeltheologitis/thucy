Summary
- Claim interpreted: The PGA Championship has 3 more cuts made than the U.S. Open.
- Scope: Verified against the available dataset for Brian Watts (table: public.brian_watts).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- Relevant table: public.brian_watts with columns: tournament, wins, top - 5, top - 25, events, cuts made.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify exact tournament names present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "tournament" FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY "tournament";
Result:
[{"tournament":"masters tournament"},{"tournament":"pga championship"},{"tournament":"the open championship"},{"tournament":"totals"},{"tournament":"us open"}]

2) Retrieve cuts made for the PGA Championship and U.S. Open
SQL:
SELECT "tournament", "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts WHERE "tournament" IN ('pga championship', 'us open');
Result:
[{"cuts made":1,"tournament":"us open"},{"cuts made":4,"tournament":"pga championship"}]

3) Compute the difference (PGA - US Open)
SQL:
SELECT
  (SELECT "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts WHERE "tournament" = 'pga championship') AS pga_cuts,
  (SELECT "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts WHERE "tournament" = 'us open') AS usopen_cuts,
  ((SELECT "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts WHERE "tournament" = 'pga championship') - (SELECT "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts WHERE "tournament" = 'us open')) AS difference;
Result:
[{"difference":3,"pga_cuts":4,"usopen_cuts":1}]

Conclusion
- According to the brian_watts table, the PGA Championship has 4 cuts made and the U.S. Open has 1 cut made; the difference is 3. This supports the claim within this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the cuts made by Brian Watts (the only relevant data available) rather than to tournaments in general or another player.
- "cut made" is interpreted as the "cuts made" statistic in the table.
