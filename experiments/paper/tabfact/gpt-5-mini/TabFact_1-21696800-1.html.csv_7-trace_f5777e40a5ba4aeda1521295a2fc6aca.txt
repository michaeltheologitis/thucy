Relevant schema identified
- Table: public.smallville_season_9

Evidence collected (with exact SQL)
1) Retrieve the episode record and its available viewership metric
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE title ILIKE 'Kandor';
- Result (single row):
  - title: kandor
  - us viewers (million): 2.63
  - other fields confirm this is the Smallville Season 9 episode “Kandor” (directed by Jeannot Szwarc; US air date: November 6, 2009; production code: 3x5258)

Analysis
- The available authoritative data records 2.63 million US viewers for the Smallville episode “Kandor”.
- There is no data in the accessible database about China viewership for this episode (or any China-specific ratings). Therefore, the claim that “2.63 million people in China” watched it is not supported by the data. Moreover, the specific figure 2.63 million is explicitly tied to US viewership in the dataset, contradicting the claim’s geographic attribution.

Conclusion
- The number 2.63 million is accurate for US viewers of “Kandor,” but the claim assigns that number to China, which is not supported by the data and conflicts with the recorded attribution (US).

Assumptions made
- The episode referred to as “Kandor” is the Smallville Season 9 episode titled “Kandor.”
- The TabFact database is authoritative for the scope of data it contains; absence of China viewership data implies we cannot validate any China-specific claim from this source.
