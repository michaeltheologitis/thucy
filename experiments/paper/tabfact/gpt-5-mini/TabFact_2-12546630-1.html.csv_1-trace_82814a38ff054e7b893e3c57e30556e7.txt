Claim to verify: “Alfredo Binda won 6 races of the 1933 Giro d’Italia, and he was the race leader for 13 races.”

Data source discovery
- Found one accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema. Contains table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia.
- Schema (from tool): columns are date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text). Winners are stage winners; race leader is the GC leader after each stage. Table rows include both stages and rest days.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total rows (stages + rest days) in the table
- Result: 24 rows
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_stages FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia;

2) Stage winners and their counts (to see Alfredo Binda’s wins)
- Result excerpt:
  - alfredo binda ( ita ) -> 6
  - rest day -> 6
  - learco guerra ( ita ) -> 3
  - ettore meini ( ita ) -> 2
  - gerard loncke ( bel ) -> 2
  - giuseppe olmo ( ita ) -> 2
  - - -> 1
  - fernand cornez ( fra ) -> 1
  - mario cipriani ( ita ) -> 1
- SQL:
  SELECT winner, COUNT(*) AS wins
  FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  GROUP BY winner
  ORDER BY wins DESC, winner;

3) Race leaders and their stage-lead counts (to see Alfredo Binda’s leader days)
- Result excerpt:
  - alfredo binda ( ita ) -> 13
  - rest day -> 6
  - jef demuysere ( bel ) -> 3
  - km (mi) -> 1
  - learco guerra ( ita ) -> 1
- SQL:
  SELECT "race leader", COUNT(*) AS led_stages
  FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  GROUP BY "race leader"
  ORDER BY led_stages DESC, "race leader";

4) Direct count of Alfredo Binda stage wins (case-insensitive)
- Result: 6
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS binda_wins
  FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  WHERE lower(winner) LIKE '%alfredo%' AND lower(winner) LIKE '%binda%';

5) Direct count of Alfredo Binda stages as race leader (case-insensitive)
- Result: 13
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS binda_led
  FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  WHERE lower("race leader") LIKE '%alfredo%' AND lower("race leader") LIKE '%binda%';

6) Sanity check excluding rest days to focus on actual race stages
- A) Total actual stages (excluding rest days and placeholder '-')
  - Result: 17
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_actual_stages
    FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
    WHERE winner IS NOT NULL
      AND winner NOT ILIKE '%rest day%'
      AND winner <> '-';
- B) Alfredo Binda stage wins among actual stages only
  - Result: 6
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS binda_stage_wins
    FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
    WHERE winner IS NOT NULL
      AND winner NOT ILIKE '%rest day%'
      AND winner <> '-'
      AND winner ILIKE '%binda%';
- C) Alfredo Binda leader count among actual stages only (excluding rows where race leader is a rest day)
  - Result: 13
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS binda_leader_count
    FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
    WHERE winner IS NOT NULL
      AND winner NOT ILIKE '%rest day%'
      AND winner <> '-'
      AND "race leader" IS NOT NULL
      AND "race leader" NOT ILIKE '%rest day%'
      AND "race leader" ILIKE '%binda%';

Conclusion
- The data shows Alfredo Binda won 6 stages and was the race leader for 13 stages in the 1933 Giro d’Italia. This directly supports both parts of the claim.

Assumptions and clarifications
- “Race” in the user’s wording is interpreted as “stage.”
- The source table includes rest days as rows; verification was done both with all rows (for leader counts) and with rest days excluded (for stage-focused sanity checks). Counts for Binda (6 wins; 13 leader stages) are unchanged when restricting to actual stages.
