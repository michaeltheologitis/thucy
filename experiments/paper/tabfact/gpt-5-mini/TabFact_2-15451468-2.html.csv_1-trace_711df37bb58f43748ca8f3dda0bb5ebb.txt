Claim: “the week 1 game have an attendance of 62936.”

What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a season game log table for the 1970 New York Giants: t_1970_new_york_giants_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance).

Evidence from data
- I queried the table for Week 1 to retrieve the recorded attendance.

Executed SQL
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance
FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season
WHERE week = 1;

Query result (single row)
{ "week": 1, "date": "1970 - 09 - 19", "opponent": "chicago bears", "result": "l 24 - 16", "game site": "yankee stadium", "attendance": 62936 }

Assessment
- The database records the Week 1 game attendance as 62,936, which matches the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the week 1 game” as referring to the Week 1 entry in the available season log table (t_1970_new_york_giants_season for the 1970 New York Giants).
