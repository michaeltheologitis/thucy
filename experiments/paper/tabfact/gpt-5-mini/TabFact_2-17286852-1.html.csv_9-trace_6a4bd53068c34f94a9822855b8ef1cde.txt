Data source discovery
- Available connection: TabFact (public schema)
- Identified table: public.my_info_table(name text, listed text, location text, county text, type text)

Step 1: Locate the Westgaard Bridge entry
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Westgaard%';
- Result:
  name: westgaard bridge
  listed: 1997 - 02 - 27
  location: voltaire
  county: mchenry
  type: pratt pony through truss

Finding: The table contains one "westgaard bridge" record. Its county is "mchenry" and its type is "pratt pony through truss."

Step 2: Check whether any "Westgaard Bridge" entry exists in Traill County
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Westgaard Bridge%' AND lower(county) = 'traill';
- Result: no rows
- Confirmation query executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Westgaard Bridge%' AND lower(county) = 'traill';
- Result: match_count = 0

Finding: There is no record of a "Westgaard Bridge" in Traill County in this dataset.

Step 3: List all bridges recorded in Traill County for context
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim(coalesce(county,''))) = 'traill';
- Results:

  - viking bridge — pratt through truss
  - blanchard bridge — pratt through truss
  - goose river bridge — pratt through truss
  - porter elliott bridge — warren through truss
  - portland park bridge — steel through girder

Finding: The dataset lists several bridges in Traill County, but none is named "Westgaard Bridge."

Assessment of the claim
- Type: "Pratt pony through truss" — Supported by the Westgaard Bridge entry.
- Location: "in Traill County" — Contradicted by the data; the entry is in McHenry County, and there is no Westgaard Bridge in Traill County in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct type with an incorrect county.

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive matching was used for textual fields.
- "Traill County" is represented in the county column as the lowercase token "traill."
