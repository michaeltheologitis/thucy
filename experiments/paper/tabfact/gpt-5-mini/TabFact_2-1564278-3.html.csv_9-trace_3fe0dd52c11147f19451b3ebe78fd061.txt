Summary
- Interpreting the claim as: “Was Rik de Voest Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent on April 4, 2011?”
- I explored the available data and found a table of Alex Bogdanovic’s finals. Evidence shows that on 4 April 2011, Bogdanovic’s opponent was Arnau Brugués-Davi, not Rik de Voest. Rik de Voest appears as Bogdanovic’s opponent on 8 April 2013.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact16 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.alex_bogdanovic with columns [date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent in the final (text), score (text)].

Evidence 1: Identify Alex Bogdanovic’s entry for 2011
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE date LIKE '%2011%';
- Result:
  • date: 4 april 2011
  • tournament: little rock , ar , usa f9
  • surface: hard
  • opponent in the final: arnau brugués - davi
  • score: 3 - 6 , 1 - 6
- Interpretation: On 4 April 2011, Bogdanovic’s opponent in the final was Arnau Brugués-Davi.

Evidence 2: Check whether Rik de Voest was ever listed as an opponent
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE lower("opponent in the final") LIKE '%rik%' OR lower("opponent in the final") LIKE '%voest%';
- Result:
  • date: 8 april 2013
  • tournament: oklahoma city , usa f9
  • surface: hard
  • opponent in the final: rik de voest
  • score: 3 - 6 , 2 - 6
- Interpretation: Rik de Voest appears as Bogdanovic’s opponent in a final on 8 April 2013, not on 4 April 2011.

Conclusion
- The data directly contradicts the claim. On April 4, 2011, Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent was Arnau Brugués-Davi. Rik de Voest was an opponent on April 8, 2013.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the user’s phrasing “be alex bogdanovic’s opponent on april 4 2011” to mean “was Rik de Voest Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent on April 4, 2011?”.
- The table lists finals; thus, “opponent” refers to the opponent in the final match recorded for that date.
