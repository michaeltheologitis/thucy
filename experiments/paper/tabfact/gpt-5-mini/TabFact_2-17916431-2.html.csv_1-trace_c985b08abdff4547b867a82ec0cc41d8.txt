Summary conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. There are 5 games in the available game list whose result is exactly "0 - 0".

Data source exploration:
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact14, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season with columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct results and their counts
- Result snippet shows "0 - 0 — 5" among other results.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  GROUP BY result
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;

2) Direct count of 0 - 0 results
- Output: 5 rows where result = '0 - 0'.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_zero_zero FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '0 - 0';

Assessment:
- Both queries consistently show that five games ended 0 - 0, which matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "the game list" to refer to all rows in public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season, the only available table containing game results in the accessible data environment.
