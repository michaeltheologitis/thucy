Claim interpreted: There is a 2002 item with the theme “D - 10 Locomotive” by the artist “Dan Fell.”

What I checked:
- Queried an authoritative dataset of Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins from the 2000s for entries in 2002 mentioning “D-10” or “locomotive,” and then retrieved the full row for that entry.

Evidence 1: Locate 2002 entries referencing D-10/locomotive
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, theme, artist
  FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
  WHERE year = 2002
    AND (
      theme ILIKE '%D-10%'
      OR theme ILIKE '%D10%'
      OR theme ILIKE '%locomotive%'
    );
- Result:
  - 2002, d - 10 locomotive, dan fell

Evidence 2: Retrieve the full row for that coin
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE year = 2002 AND theme ILIKE '%d - 10 locomotive%';
- Result (full row):
  - year: 2002
  - theme: d - 10 locomotive
  - artist: dan fell
  - mintage: included in the gray - dort
  - issue price: 59.95

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains a 2002 entry with the theme “d - 10 locomotive” and artist “dan fell,” which directly supports the claim. Minor differences in capitalization and spacing around the hyphen are present but immaterial.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin entry for 2002.
- The word “be” in the user’s text is extraneous and not part of the artist’s name.
- “From 2002” refers to the issue year field in the dataset.
