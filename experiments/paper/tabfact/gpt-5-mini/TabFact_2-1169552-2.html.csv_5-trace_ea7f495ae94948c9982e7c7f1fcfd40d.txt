Claim to verify: “1872 - 1884 be the year for hercules.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
- Discovered table: public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway (columns: class, wheel arrangement, manufacturer, year made, quantity made, quantity preserved, year (s) withdrawn)

Evidence collected
1) Locate any locomotive class containing “Hercules” and retrieve relevant years
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT class, manufacturer, "year made", "year (s) withdrawn"
  FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
  WHERE class ILIKE '%Hercules%';
- Result:
  - class: hercules
  - manufacturer: nine elms works
  - year made: 1851 - 1854
  - year(s) withdrawn: 1875 - 1884

2) Check if any entry’s withdrawn years include 1872
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
  WHERE "year (s) withdrawn" LIKE '%1872%';
- Result: No rows returned

- Executed SQL (count confirmation):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_1872
  FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
  WHERE "year (s) withdrawn" LIKE '%1872%';
- Result: matches_1872 = 0

3) Reconfirm Hercules entry with concise fields
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT class, "year (s) withdrawn", "year made"
  FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
  WHERE class ILIKE '%hercules%';
- Result:
  - class: hercules | year (s) withdrawn: 1875 - 1884 | year made: 1851 - 1854

Assessment
- The database contains a “hercules” locomotive class whose “year (s) withdrawn” is 1875 - 1884, not 1872 - 1884. Its “year made” is 1851 - 1854.
- No entries in the table have 1872 in the withdrawn-year text.
- Therefore, the claimed range 1872 - 1884 does not match the recorded years for the Hercules class in this data. The end year (1884) aligns, but the start year does not.

Conclusion
- The claim is not fully supported. The correct withdrawn range in this dataset is 1875 - 1884, not 1872 - 1884. If the claim intended another meaning of “year,” it is not reflected in the available data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “hercules” as the Hercules locomotive class listed in the Southern Railway table (the only accessible dataset).
- Interpreted “be the year” to refer to the relevant year range associated with that class; the most plausible field is “year (s) withdrawn,” since that range ends in 1884 and appears to be what the claim targets.
