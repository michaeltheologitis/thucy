Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Shane Hall ran more races with Hensley Racing than with any of his other teams.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact19 (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.shane_hall (columns include year, races, and team (s))

Step 1: Inspect all rows to understand team labels and yearly races
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.shane_hall ORDER BY "year" ASC;
Key rows (year – races – team (s)) show:
- 1995: 2 – stegell motorsports
- 1996: 14 – stegell motorsports
- 1997: 28 – stegell motorsports
- 1998: 31 – stegell motorsports
- 1999: 25 – curb - agajanian performance group
- 2000: 2 – alumni motorsports
- 2001: 33 – hensley racing
- 2002: 24 – hensley racing
- 2003: 5 – jay robinson racing
- 2004: 9 – moy racing / jay robinson racing
- 2005: 7 – jay robinson racing
- 2006: 9 – jay robinson racing
- 2008: 1 – jay robinson racing

Step 2: Sum total races by team to compare totals
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team (s)" AS team, SUM(races) AS total_races
FROM public.shane_hall
WHERE "team (s)" IS NOT NULL AND "team (s)" <> ''
GROUP BY "team (s)"
ORDER BY total_races DESC;
Results:
- stegell motorsports — 75
- hensley racing — 57
- curb - agajanian performance group — 25
- jay robinson racing — 22
- moy racing / jay robinson racing — 9
- alumni motorsports — 2

Conclusion
- Shane Hall’s total races with Hensley Racing are 57 (from 2001 and 2002).
- His highest total with any team is with Stegell Motorsports: 75 races.
- Therefore, he did not run more races with Hensley Racing than with any other team; Stegell Motorsports exceeds Hensley.

Assumptions made
- “hensley race” is interpreted as the NASCAR team “Hensley Racing.”
- Totals by team are computed using the exact team strings in the data. The mixed entry “moy racing / jay robinson racing” is treated as its own category (as the dataset does not allocate those 9 races between the two teams). This does not affect the conclusion about Hensley vs. the highest total (Stegell Motorsports).
