Claim interpreted: The San Francisco 49ers won 8 games in the 1947 season.

Findings based on the TabFact public schema:
- The table public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season contains per-game results for the 1947 season.
- Counting outcomes shows 14 total games with 8 wins, 4 losses, and 2 ties.
- The final season record row confirms 8 - 4 - 2.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Outcome distribution
SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season GROUP BY result ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- result = "w", cnt = 8
- result = "l", cnt = 4
- result = "t", cnt = 2

2) Totals (wins/losses/ties)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 'w' OR LOWER(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 'l' OR LOWER(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 't' OR LOWER(result) LIKE 't%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ties
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;
Result:
- total_games = 14, wins = 8, losses = 4, ties = 2

3) Final recorded season record
SQL:
SELECT record FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = (SELECT MAX(week) FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season);
Result:
- record = "8 - 4 - 2"

Conclusion: The data shows the 49ers won 8 games in the 1947 season.

Assumptions:
- "49ers" refers to the San Francisco 49ers in the 1947 AAFC season.
- The claim concerns regular-season results; postseason is not applicable here.
