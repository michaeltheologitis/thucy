Summary conclusion
- The available data shows Lleyton Hewitt won two ATP Masters Series tournament finals, in 2002 and 2003 (both at Indian Wells). This directly supports the claim interpreted as “Masters Series finals” (ATP Masters Series/1000 tournament finals), not the year-end Masters Cup.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data asset: PostgreSQL database TabFact (public schema).
- Identified table: lleyton_hewitt (columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score).

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Listing all rows to understand context
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM lleyton_hewitt ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result highlights (subset shown):
  - 2002 | championship: indian wells | outcome: winner | opponent: tim henman | score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 2
  - 2003 | championship: indian wells (2) | outcome: winner | opponent: gustavo kuerten | score: 6 - 1 , 6 - 1
  - Other entries around these years are runner-up results (e.g., 2002 cincinnati, 2002 paris, 2004 cincinnati (2), 2005 indian wells), confirming only two wins in this dataset.

2) Directly filtering for title wins
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, championship, outcome, surface, opponent, score
  FROM lleyton_hewitt
  WHERE lower(outcome) LIKE '%winner%'
  ORDER BY year;
- Results:
  - 2002 | indian wells | winner | hard | tim henman | 6 - 1 , 6 - 2
  - 2003 | indian wells (2) | winner | hard | gustavo kuerten | 6 - 1 , 6 - 1
- Interpretation: Exactly two Masters Series finals wins recorded, in 2002 and 2003.

Conclusion
- The data confirms Hewitt won two Masters Series finals, in 2002 and 2003.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “master series final” as the finals of ATP Masters Series (now ATP Masters 1000) tournaments, consistent with the tournament names in the dataset (Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris, Stuttgart). The dataset does not appear to cover the year-end Masters Cup/ATP Finals; therefore, this verification concerns Masters Series tournament finals only.
