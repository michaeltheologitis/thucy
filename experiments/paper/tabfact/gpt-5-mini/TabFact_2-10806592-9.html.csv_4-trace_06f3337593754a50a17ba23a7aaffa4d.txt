Summary
- Claim interpreted: “There are 3 home teams that scored higher than the away team they played.” Using the only available dataset (public.t_1938_vfl_season), the number of matches where the home team outscored the away team is 4, not 3. Distinct home teams with higher scores also equals 4.

Data source discovery
- Tool result: Accessible PostgreSQL instance with a single table: public.t_1938_vfl_season.

Schema inspection
- Table public.t_1938_vfl_season columns include: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text). Scores are text in the format like “11.23 (89)”; the integer in parentheses is the total points used for comparison.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Preview rows (to confirm score format)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date"
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
LIMIT 10;
Returned 6 rows (all matches dated 18 june 1938) with scores like “11.23 (89)”, confirming totals in parentheses.

2) Total number of rows (matches) in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Result:
- total_rows = 6

3) Count matches where the home team’s total points > away team’s total points
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS home_wins
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int > substring("away team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int;
Result:
- home_wins = 4

4) Distinct home teams that outscored their opponent (and how many such teams)
SQL (list teams):
SELECT DISTINCT "home team"
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int > (substring("away team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int
ORDER BY "home team";
Result:
- fitzroy, footscray, geelong, richmond

SQL (count distinct teams):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "home team") AS num_home_teams
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int > (substring("away team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int;
Result:
- num_home_teams = 4

Conclusion
- The data show 4 home-team wins (by total points) in the table, not 3. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim against the only available dataset: public.t_1938_vfl_season (6 matches on 18 June 1938).
- Interpreted “higher score” as higher total points, i.e., the integer in parentheses within the score fields.
- Considered both the number of matches with a home win and the number of distinct home teams with a win; both equal 4.
