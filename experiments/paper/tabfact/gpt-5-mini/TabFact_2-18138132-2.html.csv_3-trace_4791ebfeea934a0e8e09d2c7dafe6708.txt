Claim to verify: “2010 - 11 - 17 be the release date of version 1.0 with a category of utilities, a developer of dino game, and a title of msn money.”

Conclusion summary:
- Title: msn money — Supported
- Version: 1.0 — Supported
- Category: utilities — Supported
- Release date: 2010 - 11 - 17 — Not supported (data shows 2010 - 07 - 29)
- Developer: dino game — Not supported (data shows microsoft)
Overall: The claim mixes correct and incorrect details.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26)
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_zune_applications (columns: title, developer, category, "release date", version)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate the “MSN Money” entry and verify its fields
SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE lower(title) = 'msn money';
Result:
- title: msn money
- developer: microsoft
- category: utilities
- release date: 2010 - 07 - 29
- version: 1.0
Interpretation: Title, category, and version match the claim; release date and developer do not.

2) Check whether any app has developer = “dino game”
SQL (count check):
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE developer ILIKE 'dino game';
Result: match_count = 0

SQL (attempt to list rows):
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE developer ILIKE 'dino game';
Result: No rows returned
Interpretation: No apps in this table are by a developer named “dino game.”

3) Check for any app with the release date “2010 - 11 - 17”
SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE "release date" = '2010 - 11 - 17';
Results:
- title: chord finder | developer: microsoft | category: utilities | release date: 2010 - 11 - 17 | version: 1.0
- title: windows live messenger | developer: microsoft | category: social networking | release date: 2010 - 11 - 17 | version: 1.4
Interpretation: The date 2010 - 11 - 17 appears for other apps, but not for “msn money.”

Final assessment of each sub-claim:
- Title = “msn money”: Verified
- Version = 1.0: Verified
- Category = “utilities”: Verified
- Release date = “2010 - 11 - 17”: Inaccurate (actual is “2010 - 07 - 29”)
- Developer = “dino game”: Inaccurate (actual is “microsoft”)

Assumptions made:
- Case-insensitive matching for title and developer (using lower(title) and ILIKE) to account for capitalization variations.
- Exact string match for the text-formatted release date as stored in the table.
