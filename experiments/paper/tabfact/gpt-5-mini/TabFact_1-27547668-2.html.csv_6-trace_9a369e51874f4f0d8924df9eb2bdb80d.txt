Claim to verify: “January is the month that aired the most episodes, with 5.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL instance: TabFact
- Public schema tables: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (episodes of “Republic of Doyle” with original air dates)

Relevant schema (from discovery):
- public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes columns: “Unnamed: 0” (bigint), “title” (text), “directed by” (text), “written by” (text), “viewers” (bigint), “original airdate” (text), “prod code” (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect date format in the data
SQL:
SELECT "original airdate" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "original airdate" IS NOT NULL ORDER BY "Unnamed: 0" LIMIT 50;
Result (all 10 rows shown here):
- january 6 , 2010
- january 13 , 2010
- january 20 , 2010
- february 3 , 2010
- february 10 , 2010
- march 3 , 2010
- march 10 , 2010
- march 17 , 2010
- march 24 , 2010
- march 31 , 2010

2) Count episodes by month and order by count
SQL:
SELECT split_part(trim("original airdate"), ' ', 1) AS month_name, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
GROUP BY month_name
ORDER BY episode_count DESC, month_name;
Result:
- march: 5
- january: 3
- february: 2

Conclusion:
- The month with the most episodes is March (5 episodes), not January. January has 3 episodes.

Final assessment: The claim that January aired the most episodes with 5 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- The month name is the first token of the “original airdate” text (e.g., “march 31 , 2010” → month = “march”). Months are treated case-insensitively and as stored (lowercase).
