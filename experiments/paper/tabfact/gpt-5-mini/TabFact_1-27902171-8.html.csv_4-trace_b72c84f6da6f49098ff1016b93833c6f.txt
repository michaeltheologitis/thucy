Summary
- Claim interpreted: The game with the score string "W 112 - 91" occurred after March 19.
- Finding: The only game in the available dataset with score "w 112 - 91" occurred on March 19 (not after).

Data sources and schema inspected
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public
- Table: t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season (columns: game bigint, date text, team text, score text, high points text, high rebounds text, high assists text, location attendance text, record text)

Evidence
1) Sample rows to understand formats
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists", "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
ORDER BY game
LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows:
- game 67 | date: march 19 | team: houston rockets | score: w 112 - 91

2) Exact match for the score "w 112 - 91" (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team AS opponent_team, score
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
WHERE lower(score) = 'w 112 - 91';
Result:
- game: 67, date: march 19, opponent team: houston rockets, score: w 112 - 91

Conclusion
- The dataset contains one instance of the score string "w 112 - 91", and its date is March 19. Therefore, it is not after March 19. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics season table) and the score string formatting found therein.
- "After March 19" is interpreted strictly as a date later than March 19 (not including March 19 itself).
