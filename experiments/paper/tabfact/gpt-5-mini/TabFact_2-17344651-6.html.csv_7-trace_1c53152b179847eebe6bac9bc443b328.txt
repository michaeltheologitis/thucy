Claim to verify: “less than half the 1984–1985 season game be play in the Boston Garden.”

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season (columns: game, date, opponent, score, location, record)

Step 1 — Determine total games in the available 1984–85 dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result:
  total_games = 14

Step 2 — Inspect how venues are encoded
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT location FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season ORDER BY location;
- Result (distinct locations):
  boston garden; brendan byrne arena; hartford civic center; madison square garden; market square arena; the omni; the spectrum

Step 3 — Count games played at Boston Garden
- Executed SQL (exact match on venue name):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS boston_garden_games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE location = 'boston garden';
- Result:
  boston_garden_games = 8

Step 4 — Cross-check distribution by location
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS games
  FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  GROUP BY location
  ORDER BY games DESC, location;
- Result (location : games):
  boston garden : 8
  brendan byrne arena : 1
  hartford civic center : 1
  madison square garden : 1
  market square arena : 1
  the omni : 1
  the spectrum : 1

Step 5 — Compute percentage of games at Boston Garden
- Executed SQL (case-insensitive substring match, confirmatory):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS boston_garden_games FROM t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE lower(location) LIKE '%boston garden%';
- Results:
  total_games = 14 (from Step 1)
  boston_garden_games = 8
  Percentage = 8 / 14 ≈ 57.14%

Conclusion based on available data:
- In this 1984–85 Boston Celtics dataset (14 games), 8 games were played at Boston Garden, which is more than half (≈57.14%). Therefore, the claim that “less than half … were played in the Boston Garden” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- I interpreted “season game” as referring to the Boston Celtics 1984–85 season because the only available dataset is t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season.
- I treated the location column as the game venue and “boston garden” as the indicator of games played at Boston Garden.
- The verification is constrained to the scope of the available table (14 games). Within this scope, the claim is contradicted by the data.
