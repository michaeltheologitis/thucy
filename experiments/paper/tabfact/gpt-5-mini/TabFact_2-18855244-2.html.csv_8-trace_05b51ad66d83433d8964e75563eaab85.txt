Summary conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. At least one athlete in the available database is recorded with medals in the pommel horse event.

Evidence from the database
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database TabFact (postgres_tabfact17), schema public. Relevant table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists with columns: "medal count" (bigint), date (text), athlete (text), nation (text), sport (text), "record medal event" (text).

Query 1: Retrieve any athletes with pommel horse listed in their record medal event
- Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, sport, "record medal event", "medal count", date
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE "record medal event" ILIKE '%pommel%';
- Result (1 row):
  • athlete: hermann weingärtner; sport: gymnastics; record medal event: pommel horse s; medal count: 4; date: 9 april 1896

Query 2: Count distinct athletes with pommel in record medal event
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athlete_count
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE lower("record medal event") LIKE '%pommel%';
- Result: distinct_athlete_count = 1

Additional check (names):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE lower("record medal event") LIKE '%pommel%';
- Result: hermann weingärtner

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: "none of the athlete receive a medal for pommel horse"
- Finding: False. The table contains at least one athlete (Hermann Weingärtner) associated with pommel horse as a record medal event, with a medal count of 4.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: within the available database, there are no athletes recorded as having received medals in the pommel horse event. I used a case-insensitive substring search for "pommel" within the "record medal event" field to capture any pommel horse-related entries.
