Data sources explored
- Discovered available source: postgres_tabfact6 (public schema). Identified one relevant table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials with columns: "skip", "third / vice skip", "second", "lead", "city".

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check whether Martin Crête is listed as a skip in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE "skip" ILIKE '%Martin%';
Result: no rows returned
Interpretation: No skip in this table contains the name "Martin"; thus, Martin Crête is not listed as a skip here.

2) List all teams from Winnipeg and identify their skips
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city ILIKE '%Winnipeg%';
Results:
- skip: kerry burtnyk, city: winnipeg
- skip: jeff stoughton, city: winnipeg
- skip: mike mcewen, city: winnipeg
Interpretation: For this dataset (2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials), the Winnipeg teams are skipped by Kerry Burtnyk, Jeff Stoughton, and Mike McEwen—not Martin Crête.

Conclusion
Within the available authoritative dataset covering the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials, Martin Crête is not listed as a skip, and Winnipeg teams are associated with other skips. Therefore, the claim that Martin Crête is listed as a skip for Winnipeg is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to whether Martin Crête appears as a listed skip for a Winnipeg-based team in the available curling roster dataset (2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials). No other sports/roster tables were available in the connected data sources.
