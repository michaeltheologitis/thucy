Claim interpreted: “All the matches are on the same date.” Context grounded in the available data: public.t_1975_vfl_season.

Data source exploration
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact9 (public schema)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1975_vfl_season (columns include: "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", "venue", crowd, "date")

Evidence
1) Total number of matches (rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
count = 6

2) Number of distinct dates
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "date") FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result:
count = 1

3) Dates with counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY "date" ORDER BY "date";
Result:
- date = 7 june 1975, cnt = 6

4) Sample rows for context
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season ORDER BY "date" LIMIT 5;
Sample results:
- geelong | melbourne | 7 june 1975
- st kilda | north melbourne | 7 june 1975
- richmond | essendon | 7 june 1975
- hawthorn | collingwood | 7 june 1975
- fitzroy | carlton | 7 june 1975

Conclusion
- All 6 matches in public.t_1975_vfl_season share the same date value: 7 june 1975. The distinct-date count equals 1, confirming the claim for this dataset.

Assumptions
- “All the match” is interpreted as all rows in the table public.t_1975_vfl_season.
- The scope is limited to the accessible dataset (postgres_tabfact9/public). The "date" field is stored as text; comparisons use exact text values as stored.
