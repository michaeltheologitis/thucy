Claim to verify: “all of alberto pagain's win be of the 500cc class, with an average point of 87.”

Summary of findings
- All recorded wins are indeed in the 500cc class. Verified by listing all rows and aggregating wins by class.
- The “average point of 87” is not supported by the data under several reasonable interpretations of “average.” The value 87 appears as his 1972 500cc season points (a single-season value), not an average.

Evidence from data
1) Full row listing to inspect wins and classes
SQL executed:
SELECT year, class, team, points, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani ORDER BY year;
Key rows with wins > 0 (extracted from the full result):
- 1969 | class: 500cc | team: linto     | points: 15 | wins: 1
- 1971 | class: 500cc | team: linto     | points: 29 | wins: 1
- 1971 | class: 500cc | team: mv agusta | points: 29 | wins: 1
- 1972 | class: 500cc | team: mv agusta | points: 87 | wins: 1
Conclusion from row-level inspection: Every row with wins > 0 is in the 500cc class.

2) Aggregate check: total wins by class
SQL executed:
SELECT class, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY class ORDER BY total_wins DESC, class;
Result:
- 500cc: 4
- 125cc: 0
- 250cc: 0
- 350cc: 0
- 50cc: 0
SQL executed:
SELECT class FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY class HAVING SUM(wins) > 0 ORDER BY class;
Result:
- 500cc
Conclusion: All 4 recorded wins are in 500cc; no other class has a win.

3) “Average points” checks
(a) Overall average points across all rows
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG(points) AS avg_points, COUNT(*) AS n_rows FROM alberto_pagani;
Result: avg_points ≈ 9.3103 (n_rows = 29)

(b) Average points for rows with wins > 0 (i.e., seasons/entries with at least one win)
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG(points) AS avg_points_wins_gt0, COUNT(*) AS n_rows_with_wins_gt0 FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
Result: avg_points_wins_gt0 = 40.0 (n_rows_with_wins_gt0 = 4)

(c) Average points for 500cc rows only
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG(points) AS avg_points_500cc, COUNT(*) AS n_rows_500cc FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '500cc';
Result: avg_points_500cc = 25.25 (n_rows_500cc = 8)

(d) Points per win aggregates (if “average points” was intended as points per win)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, SUM(wins) AS total_wins, SUM(points)::numeric / NULLIF(SUM(wins),0) AS points_per_win FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
Result: total_points = 160, total_wins = 4, points_per_win = 40.0
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, SUM(wins) AS total_wins, SUM(points)::numeric / NULLIF(SUM(wins),0) AS points_per_win FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 AND class = '500cc';
Result: total_points = 160, total_wins = 4, points_per_win = 40.0

Interpretation of the “87” figure
- The number 87 appears as the points value in 1972 for the 500cc class (MV Agusta), where he had 1 win that year.
- No reasonable average (overall, wins-only, 500cc-only, or points per win) equals 87.

Conclusion
- Part 1 (all wins are in 500cc): Supported by the data.
- Part 2 (“average point of 87”): Not supported; the only 87 present is a single-season points total (1972 500cc), not an average.

Assumptions
- “alberto pagain” refers to Alberto Pagani; verification used the public.alberto_pagani table.
- “average point” was interpreted under multiple standard definitions: mean of points across all rows; mean across rows with wins; mean across 500cc rows; and points-per-win. None match 87.
- The wins column is the count of wins for that row’s season/class/team entry; summing by class yields career wins in that class.
