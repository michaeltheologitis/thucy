Conclusion: The claim "rank 4 be lower than 6:40.02" is false in the available data. Rank 4’s recorded time is 6:50.48, which is slower (greater) than 6:40.02.

Evidence from data
1) Full table view to identify the rank 4 time
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, rowers, country, time, notes FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY rank ASC;
- Results (excerpt):
  • rank: 4, rowers: "zsolt hirling , tamã¡s varga", country: hungary, time: 6:50.48, notes: "sc / d"

2) Numeric comparison of rank 4 time against 6:40.02 (400.02 seconds)
- Executed SQL (read raw time):
SELECT rank, time FROM my_info_table WHERE rank = 4;
- Result: [{"rank":4,"time":"6:50.48"}]

- Executed SQL (convert to seconds and compare):
SELECT rank, time,
 (CAST(split_part(time, ':', 1) AS numeric) * 60 + CAST(split_part(time, ':', 2) AS numeric)) AS total_seconds,
 ((CAST(split_part(time, ':', 1) AS numeric) * 60 + CAST(split_part(time, ':', 2) AS numeric)) < 400.02) AS less_than_400_02
FROM my_info_table
WHERE rank = 4;
- Result: [{"rank":4, "time":"6:50.48", "total_seconds":410.48, "less_than_400_02":false}]

Interpretation
- Time format interpreted as minutes:seconds.fraction. Rank 4 total_seconds = 6*60 + 50.48 = 410.48 seconds, which is greater than 400.02 seconds (6:40.02). Therefore, rank 4 is not lower/faster than 6:40.02.

Assumptions
- "Lower" refers to a faster time (numerically smaller duration).
- Times are stored as mm:ss.xx in the public.my_info_table dataset, which is treated as authoritative for this verification.
