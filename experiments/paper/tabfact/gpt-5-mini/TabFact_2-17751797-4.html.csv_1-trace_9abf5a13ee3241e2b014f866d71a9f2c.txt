Summary
- Claim: “the score be 2 - 3 when the away team be liverpool on the date of 30 / 01 / 1991.”
- Finding: Verified. The 1990–91 FA Cup record shows a match on 30 / 01 / 1991 with away team Liverpool and a final score of 2 - 3.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1990_91_fa_cup (columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" — all text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate matches where the away team is Liverpool
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "score", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%Liverpool%';
Result:
- home team: brighton & hove albion
- away team: liverpool
- score: 2 - 3
- date: 30 / 01 / 1991

2) Explicitly match the date (normalizing spaces) and the away team
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "score", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE REPLACE("date",' ', '') = '30/01/1991' AND LOWER("away team") = 'liverpool';
Result:
- home team: brighton & hove albion
- away team: liverpool
- score: 2 - 3
- date: 30 / 01 / 1991

Conclusion
- The data confirms that on 30 / 01 / 1991, with Liverpool as the away team, the score was 2 - 3. Therefore, the claim is supported by the records in the t_1990_91_fa_cup table.

Assumptions
- Date strings in the table include spaces (e.g., "30 / 01 / 1991"), so normalization (removing spaces) was applied for matching.
- Team name matching was performed case-insensitively (stored as "liverpool").
