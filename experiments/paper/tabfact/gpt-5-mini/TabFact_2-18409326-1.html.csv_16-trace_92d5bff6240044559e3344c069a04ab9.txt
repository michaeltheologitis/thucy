Claim to verify: “bell media own 3 separate radio station like the cbc.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact instance) with a public schema. Only one relevant table was found: public.media_in_kelowna (contains columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner).

Step 1: Inspect all rows to identify owners
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna;

Returned rows (abridged to owner-relevant details):
1) owner: astral media
2) owner: canadian broadcasting corporation (CBC Radio One)
3) owner: canadian broadcasting corporation (CBC Radio 2)
4) owner: canadian broadcasting corporation (Première Chaîne)
5) owner: sun country cablevision
6) owner: bell media (99.9 Sun FM)
7) owner: bell media (101.5 EZ Rock)
8) owner: jim pattison group
9) owner: vista broadcast group
10) owner: jim pattison group

Step 2: Count stations owned by Bell Media and CBC in this dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT owner, count(*) AS station_count FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%bell%' OR owner ILIKE '%canadian%' GROUP BY owner;

Results:
- bell media — station_count: 2
- canadian broadcasting corporation — station_count: 3

Findings
- In the Kelowna market (as represented by the available dataset), Bell Media owns 2 radio stations, while the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) owns 3.
- Therefore, within this dataset, the statement that “Bell Media own 3 separate radio station like the CBC” is not supported; the evidence shows Bell Media has fewer (2) than CBC (3).

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative data available (Kelowna radio stations), the claim is inaccurate in this context.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Due to available data, verification is scoped to the Kelowna radio market represented in public.media_in_kelowna.
- “like the cbc” was interpreted as “also owning three radio stations in the same market.”
- CBC entries are recorded under the full name “canadian broadcasting corporation” in the dataset and were matched accordingly.
