Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: In 2005, at the Tony Awards, William Ivey Long was a nominee for Best Costume Design.
- Finding: Supported by the data. A 2005 Tony Award entry lists “william ivey long” as a nominee in “best costume design,” with result “nominated.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical with columns (year, award, category, nominee, result) containing award records for the musical La Cage aux Folles.

Evidence and executed SQL
- Query objective: Retrieve 2005 Tony Award entries where the category includes Costume Design.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
  FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
  WHERE year = 2005
    AND award ILIKE '%Tony Award%'
    AND category ILIKE '%Costume Design%';

- Result row returned:
  • year: 2005
  • award: tony award
  • category: best costume design
  • nominee: william ivey long
  • result: nominated

Conclusion
- The data directly supports that William Ivey Long was a Tony Award nominee for Best Costume Design in 2005.

Notes and assumptions
- The table is specific to La Cage aux Folles, implying this nomination relates to the 2004–2005 Broadway revival of La Cage aux Folles. The category field in this dataset appears as “best costume design” without explicitly stating “of a Musical,” though the Tony Awards split Costume Design into Play and Musical in 2005. The user’s name spelling (“qilliam”) was interpreted as “William Ivey Long.”
