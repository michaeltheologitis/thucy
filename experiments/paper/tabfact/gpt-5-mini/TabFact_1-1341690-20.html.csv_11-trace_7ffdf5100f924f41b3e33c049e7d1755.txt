Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the candidates for Maryland’s 7th congressional district were incumbent Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table found: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates)

Step 1: Retrieve all Maryland districts for 1974 to see incumbents and candidates
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district ILIKE '%Maryland%';
Key returned rows:
- maryland 6 | incumbent: goodloe byron | candidates: goodloe byron (d) 73.7% elton r wampler (r) 26.3%
- maryland 7 | incumbent: parren mitchell | candidates: parren mitchell (d) unopposed
Interpretation: In 1974, Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler ran in Maryland’s 6th district. Maryland’s 7th district had Parren Mitchell, unopposed.

Step 2: Confirm where Byron and Wampler appear in 1974
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Wampler%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Goodloe Byron%';
Result:
- district: maryland 6 | candidates: goodloe byron (d) 73.7% elton r wampler (r) 26.3%
Interpretation: The only 1974 row featuring both names is Maryland 6, not Maryland 7.

Conclusion
- The data clearly shows that in 1974, Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler were candidates in Maryland’s 6th congressional district. Maryland’s 7th district featured incumbent Parren Mitchell, unopposed. Therefore, the claim that these two were the candidates for Maryland district 7 is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim was evaluated against the 1974 U.S. House elections table because that is the authoritative data available and it includes both names mentioned. Even under this reasonable interpretation, the claim is incorrect.
