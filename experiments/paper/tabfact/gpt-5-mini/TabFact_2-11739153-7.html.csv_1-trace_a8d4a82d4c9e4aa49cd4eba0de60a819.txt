- Relevant table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence from data
Exploratory SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Feb%' ORDER BY date;

Returned rows included (excerpt):
- {date: "february 10", visitor: "minnesota", score: "2 - 1", home: "st louis"}
- {date: "february 24", visitor: "calgary", score: "2 - 1", home: "minnesota"}

Final SQL executed (ordered by day of month):
SELECT date, visitor, score, home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE date ILIKE '%feb%' ORDER BY CAST(substring(date FROM '\\d+') AS integer);

Relevant results:
- february 10 — minnesota — 2 - 1 — st louis
- february 24 — calgary — 2 - 1 — minnesota

Interpretation
- February 10: Minnesota (visitor) at St. Louis — score recorded as 2 - 1.
- February 24: Calgary (visitor) at Minnesota — score recorded as 2 - 1.
Both dates have a final score of 2–1, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- The table public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season represents the 2007–08 season; dates like "february 10" refer to February 2008.
- The score format is visitor goals – home goals (consistent with the visitor/home columns).
