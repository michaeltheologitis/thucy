Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to identify any tables containing draft-related fields (pick, round, college).
- Queried the relevant table to check whether pick number 155 is present and what college is listed.

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (postgres_tabfact31), schema public.
- Only one table was found relevant to drafts: public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season with columns (round, pick, player, position, college).

Schema detail
- Table: public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season
  - Columns: round, pick, player, position, college

Evidence 1: Find pick 155 and its college
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, college FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE pick = 155;
Result:
- player: john nies
- college: arizona

Evidence 2: Context via full ordered list
Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, player, position, college
FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season
ORDER BY CAST(pick AS INTEGER) ASC;
Relevant result row:
- round: 6, pick: 155, player: john nies, position: punter, college: arizona

Assessment
- The dataset shows that pick number 155 corresponds to John Nies, whose college is recorded as “arizona.” This supports the claim that pick 155 came from Arizona (commonly referring to the University of Arizona). The phrasing “arizona university” differs slightly from the dataset’s label “arizona,” but this is a minor naming variation, and the evidence supports the substance of the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim pertains to the draft data represented by the available table (1990 Buffalo Bills season draft picks). No other draft datasets were available.
- The college value “arizona” denotes the University of Arizona rather than Arizona State University, consistent with common sports data conventions in similar tables.
