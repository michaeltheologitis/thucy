Claim to verify: “NGC 2082 has a deeper declination of °59′28″ than any other galaxy in the Dorado group.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, schema public, table public.dorado_group, which lists objects in the Dorado group with name, type, RA (J2000), Dec (J2000), redshift, and apparent magnitude. Note: The declination field appears as text with the literal word “degree” followed by minutes and seconds (minutes′seconds″). The degree number itself is not present in this column.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the record for NGC 2082
SQL:
SELECT name, type, "ra ( j2000 )", "dec ( j2000 )", "redshift (km / s )", "apparent magnitude"
FROM public.dorado_group
WHERE name ILIKE '%2082%';
Result:
- name: ngc 2082; type: sab (rs + ) c; RA: 05h41 m51.1s; Dec:  degree18′04″; redshift: 1184 ± 6; mag: 12.6
Interpretation: In this dataset, NGC 2082’s declination minutes and seconds are 18′04″. The degree value is not recorded in this field.

2) Explicitly extract the minutes and seconds for NGC 2082 from the declination text
SQL:
SELECT name, "dec ( j2000 )" AS dec,
       ((string_to_array(trim(regexp_replace("dec ( j2000 )", '[^0-9]+', ' ', 'g')), ' '))[1])::int AS minutes,
       ((string_to_array(trim(regexp_replace("dec ( j2000 )", '[^0-9]+', ' ', 'g')), ' '))[2])::int AS seconds
FROM public.dorado_group
WHERE lower(name) = 'ngc 2082';
Result: minutes = 18, seconds = 4
Interpretation: The claimed minutes component “28′” does not match the data-supported minutes “18′”.

3) Check if any object in the table has declination text with the substring “59′28″” (i.e., minutes 59, seconds 28)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.dorado_group WHERE "dec ( j2000 )" LIKE '%59′28″%';
Result: 0 rows
SQL:
SELECT name, type, "ra ( j2000 )", "dec ( j2000 )", "redshift (km / s )", "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE "dec ( j2000 )" LIKE '%59′28″%';
Result: no rows
Interpretation: No object in this dataset has declination minutes/seconds exactly “59′28″” in the text field.

4) Compare NGC 2082’s minutes to others to assess whether it is unusually “deep” (southerly) by minutes alone
SQL:
SELECT name, "dec ( j2000 )" AS dec,
       ((string_to_array(trim(regexp_replace("dec ( j2000 )", '[^0-9]+', ' ', 'g')), ' '))[1])::int AS minutes,
       ((string_to_array(trim(regexp_replace("dec ( j2000 )", '[^0-9]+', ' ', 'g')), ' '))[2])::int AS seconds
FROM public.dorado_group
ORDER BY minutes DESC, seconds DESC
LIMIT 5;
Top results (name — dec — minutes — seconds):
1. ngc 1574 —  degree58′29″ — 58 — 29
2. ngc 1566 —  degree56′16″ — 56 — 16
3. ngc 1688 —  degree48′01″ — 48 — 1
4. ngc 1559 —  degree47′01″ — 47 — 1
5. ngc 1553 —  degree46′49″ — 46 — 49
NGC 2082 has minutes = 18 (see step 2), which is not extreme within this group even by minutes; many objects have larger minute values than 28′.

Findings:
- The dataset shows NGC 2082 with declination minutes and seconds of 18′04″, not 28′ (contradicting the “°59′28″” minutes portion of the claim).
- The dataset’s declination field lacks the degree number entirely, so we cannot compute absolute declinations to definitively rank “deepest” (most southerly) across all galaxies. However, even considering minutes alone, several galaxies have minute values well above 28, undermining the idea that NGC 2082 is “deeper than any other galaxy” in the Dorado group.

Conclusion:
- The claimed specific declination for NGC 2082 (“°59′28″” i.e., 59 degrees 28 minutes) is not supported by the data here (which shows 18′04″ for the minutes/seconds components). Moreover, the “deeper than any other galaxy” assertion is not supported by the available declination text values and appears unlikely even by the minutes comparison.

Assumptions and limitations:
- Interpreted “deeper declination” as more negative (southerly) declination in J2000 coordinates.
- The public.dorado_group table’s declination column stores only minutes and seconds (the literal word “degree” appears, but the degree value is missing). I treated the first two numeric tokens as minutes and seconds based on the observed pattern.
- All evidence and conclusions are grounded strictly in the available dataset; no external catalogs were used.
