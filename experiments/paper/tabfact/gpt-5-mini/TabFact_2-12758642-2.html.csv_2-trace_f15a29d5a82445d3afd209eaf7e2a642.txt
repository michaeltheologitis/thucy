Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there exists a match in Tokyo, Japan involving Hikaru Sato that ended before Round 2 (i.e., in Round 1).

Data source exploration:
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (public schema) with a single table: public.katsuya_inoue.
- Table public.katsuya_inoue columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text), location (text).

Evidence retrieval:
- I searched the available table for any bout where the opponent is "Hikaru Sato" and the location includes "Tokyo".

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT res, method, event, round, time, location
FROM public.katsuya_inoue
WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Hikaru Sato'
  AND location ILIKE '%tokyo%';

Query result (1 matching bout):
- res: win
- method: tko (punches)
- event: pancrase - brave 6
- round: 1
- time: 3:53
- location: tokyo , japan

Assessment:
- This record shows a bout involving Hikaru Sato (as opponent) held in Tokyo, Japan, that ended in Round 1 at 3:53. That satisfies the claim that Hikaru Sato’s match in Tokyo ended before Round 2.

Assumptions made:
- "Ended before round 2" means the bout ended in Round 1.
- "Hikaru Sato’s match" refers to any bout in which Hikaru Sato participated, regardless of whether he won or lost; the available table lists the other fighter’s (Katsuya Inoue’s) bouts, with Hikaru Sato as opponent.
- Location matching used case-insensitive substring matching on the location field (contains "Tokyo").
