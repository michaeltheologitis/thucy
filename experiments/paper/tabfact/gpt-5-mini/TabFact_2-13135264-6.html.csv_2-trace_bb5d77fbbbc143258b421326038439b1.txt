Claim interpreted: The highest single-game score by Detroit (Red Wings) in the season covered by the dataset occurred on January 5, with Detroit scoring 6 goals.

Data source: postgres_tabfact5, public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season (2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season game log).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm how “Detroit” is recorded in the table (to parse correctly):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT visitor, home FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE visitor ILIKE '%detroit%' OR home ILIKE '%detroit%';
Observation: The team appears as 'detroit' in visitor/home columns.

2) Compute Detroit’s maximum goals in any single game (score format is 'visitor_goals - home_goals'):
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN visitor='detroit' THEN split_part(score,' - ',1)::int ELSE split_part(score,' - ',2)::int END) AS max_goals FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
Result:
max_goals = 6

3) List all games where Detroit scored that maximum (6 goals):
SQL:
SELECT date,
       CASE WHEN visitor='detroit' THEN home ELSE visitor END AS opponent,
       CASE WHEN visitor='detroit' THEN 'away' ELSE 'home' END AS location,
       score,
       (CASE WHEN visitor='detroit' THEN split_part(score,' - ',1)::int ELSE split_part(score,' - ',2)::int END) AS detroit_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE (CASE WHEN visitor='detroit' THEN split_part(score,' - ',1)::int ELSE split_part(score,' - ',2)::int END) = 6
ORDER BY date;
Returned row(s):
- date: january 5 | opponent: nashville | location: home | score: 0 - 6 | detroit_goals: 6

Conclusion
- Supported by the data: Detroit’s highest single-game goal total in the dataset is 6, achieved on January 5 (home vs Nashville), matching the claim that the highest score of the season was Detroit on January 5 with 6 points/goals.

Assumptions
- “Score”/“points” in the claim refers to goals scored by Detroit in a single game.
- The dataset represents the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season only; the claim is verified within this scope, not league-wide.
