Claim assessed: “the company of epcor have a joint control entity type.”

Data source discovery
- Explored available sources and found one database: TabFact (public schema).
- Schema inspection shows a relevant table: public.klm with columns: company (text), type (text), principal activities (text), incorporated in (text), "group 's equity shareholding" (text).

Evidence from data (exact executed SQL and results)
1) Check presence of EPCOR in the company column
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.klm WHERE company ILIKE '%EPCOR%';
Result:
match_count = 1

2) Retrieve EPCOR’s type
SQL:
SELECT company, type FROM public.klm WHERE company ILIKE '%EPCOR%';
Result:
company = epcor
type = subsidiary

3) Check for any “joint control(l)ed” entity types in the table
SQL:
SELECT company, type FROM public.klm WHERE type ILIKE '%joint%control%';
Result:
company = schiphol logistics park
type = joint controlled entity

Assessment
- The only EPCOR entry in the dataset has type = “subsidiary,” not a joint control entity.
- The table does contain an example of “joint controlled entity,” but it is associated with “schiphol logistics park,” not EPCOR.

Conclusion
Based on the authoritative TabFact public.klm table, EPCOR does not have a joint control entity type; it is listed as a subsidiary.

Assumptions
- “the company of epcor” refers to the row(s) where public.klm.company matches “EPCOR” (case-insensitive, substring). 
- The TabFact.public.klm table is the authoritative source for company type in this context.
