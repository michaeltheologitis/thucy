Claim to verify: "the size of the crowd when Essendon be the away team be 25158"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1954_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd" (bigint), "date"

What the data shows
- The table contains 6 matches (all dated 31 July 1954). Essendon appears once as the away team in this dataset, and that match’s recorded crowd is 28,158—not 25,158.
- No match in this table has a crowd of exactly 25,158.

Executed SQL and results
1) Count total rows in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
Result:
 total_rows = 6

2) Count rows where away team contains 'essendon' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS away_essendon_count FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE lower("away team") LIKE '%essendon%';
Result:
 away_essendon_count = 1

3) List the match(es) where Essendon is the away team
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "date", "venue", crowd FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE lower("away team") LIKE '%essendon%' ORDER BY "date";
Result:
 home team: geelong; date: 31 july 1954; venue: kardinia park; crowd: 28158

4) Check if any match has crowd exactly 25,158
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE crowd = 25158;
Result:
 match_count = 0

5) Sample rows (to show context of all matches in the table)
SQL:
SELECT "home team","away team",date,venue,crowd FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Result (all 6 rows):
- collingwood vs st kilda, date: 31 july 1954, venue: victoria park, crowd: 16500
- carlton vs richmond, date: 31 july 1954, venue: princes park, crowd: 25863
- melbourne vs hawthorn, date: 31 july 1954, venue: mcg, crowd: 26708
- south melbourne vs footscray, date: 31 july 1954, venue: lake oval, crowd: 19500
- north melbourne vs fitzroy, date: 31 july 1954, venue: arden street oval, crowd: 11000
- geelong vs essendon, date: 31 july 1954, venue: kardinia park, crowd: 28158

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data. In this dataset, when Essendon is the away team, the recorded crowd is 28,158, and there are zero matches with a crowd of 25,158.

Assumptions
- Interpretation is limited to the available table public.t_1954_vfl_season (a 6-row subset dated 31 July 1954). Team names in the table are stored in lowercase (e.g., 'essendon'). The claim was interpreted as referring to this dataset and date scope.
