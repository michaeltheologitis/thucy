Claim to verify: “the philippine and macau have win the same number of gold and silver medal for wushu, but macau have win 4 more bronze medal.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact — public schema) containing a table named wushu_at_the_asian_games.
- Table structure (public.wushu_at_the_asian_games): columns = rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint). One row per nation with medal counts.

Evidence from the data
1) Locate rows for the Philippines and Macau/Macao in the Wushu at the Asian Games table.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
  FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
  WHERE nation ILIKE '%phil%'
     OR nation ILIKE '%macau%'
     OR nation ILIKE '%macao%'
  ORDER BY nation;
- Result:
  - macau (mac): gold = 1, silver = 5, bronze = 4, total = 10
  - philippines (phi): gold = 1, silver = 5, bronze = 8, total = 14

2) Compute direct comparison (gold/silver equality and bronze difference Macau − Philippines).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT
   p.nation as philippines_nation, p.gold as ph_gold, p.silver as ph_silver, p.bronze as ph_bronze,
   m.nation as macau_nation, m.gold as mac_gold, m.silver as mac_silver, m.bronze as mac_bronze,
   (p.gold = m.gold) as gold_equal,
   (p.silver = m.silver) as silver_equal,
   (m.bronze - p.bronze) as bronze_difference_macau_minus_philippines
  FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games p
  JOIN public.wushu_at_the_asian_games m ON 1=1
  WHERE p.nation ILIKE '%Philipp%' AND (m.nation ILIKE '%Macau%' OR m.nation ILIKE '%Macao%');
- Result:
  - philippines (phi): gold = 1, silver = 5, bronze = 8
  - macau (mac): gold = 1, silver = 5, bronze = 4
  - gold_equal = true; silver_equal = true; bronze_difference_macau_minus_philippines = -4 (i.e., Macau has 4 fewer bronze medals than the Philippines).

Assessment of the claim
- Same gold and silver: Supported. Both have 1 gold and 5 silver in this dataset.
- “Macau have win 4 more bronze medal”: Not supported. The data shows the Philippines have 8 bronze versus Macau’s 4 bronze. Macau has 4 fewer bronze medals than the Philippines, not 4 more.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct part (equal gold and silver) with an incorrect part (direction of bronze advantage). Overall, this is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to total medals for Wushu at the Asian Games, based on the available table (public.wushu_at_the_asian_games).
- Mapped “philippine” to the nation entry “philippines (phi)” and “macau” to “macau (mac)”. Also searched for the alternative spelling “Macao”.
