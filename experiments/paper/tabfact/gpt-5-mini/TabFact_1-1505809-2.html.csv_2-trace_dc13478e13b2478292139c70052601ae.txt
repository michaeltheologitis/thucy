Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier with columns including w (wins) and "blank ends" (bigint)

Step 1: Confirm rows exist with w = 6
Evidence (executed SQL):
1) Distinct w values with counts
SELECT w, COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
GROUP BY w
ORDER BY w;
Result excerpt: w = 6 -> 4 rows (table total = 11 rows)

2) Total row count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier;
Result: 11 rows

Step 2: Retrieve rows where w = 6 and inspect "blank ends"
Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT skip, locale, w, "blank ends" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE w = 6;
Results:
- skip: deane horning, locale: british columbia, w: 6, "blank ends": 18
- skip: wayne middaugh, locale: ontario, w: 6, "blank ends": 10
- skip: brad gushue, locale: newfoundland and labrador, w: 6, "blank ends": 13
- skip: pat simmons, locale: saskatchewan, w: 6, "blank ends": 12

Step 3: Compute the minimum "blank ends" for w = 6
Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT MIN("blank ends") AS min_blank_ends FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE w = 6;
Result: min_blank_ends = 10

Conclusion
- The lowest (minimum) value of "blank ends" among rows where w = 6 is 10. This directly supports the claim that “10 [is] the lowest value of blank end when the win (w) [is] 6.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted “blank end” as the column named "blank ends" in table public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier.
- Interpreted “win (w)” as the column w in the same table.
- The claim pertains to the data contained within this specific table.
