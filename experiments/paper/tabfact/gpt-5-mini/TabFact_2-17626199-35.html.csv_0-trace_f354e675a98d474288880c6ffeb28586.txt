Claim interpreted: “On July 13th, set 3 be 12 - 25.” I interpret this as asserting that there exists at least one match on July 13 where the third set score was 12 - 25.

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact5 (TabFact PostgreSQL database), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
  - Columns (all text): date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify rows occurring on July 13 (broad numeric match on day 13):
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt
FROM t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE date ~ '(^|[^0-9])13([^0-9]|$)';
Result:
- cnt = 2

2) Retrieve those rows and inspect set 3:
SQL:
SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total
FROM t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE date ~ '(^|[^0-9])13([^0-9]|$)';
Returned rows:
- Row 1: date: 13 jul | score: 0 - 3 | set 1: 9 - 25 | set 2: 17 - 25 | set 3: 12 - 25 | total: 38 - 75
- Row 2: date: 13 jul | score: 3 - 0 | set 1: 25 - 23 | set 2: 25 - 10 | set 3: 25 - 13 | total: 75 - 46

3) Stricter match for “July 13” textual form:
SQL:
SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%13 jul%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%jul 13%';
Returned rows (explicit July 13 mention):
- Row 1: date: 13 jul | score: 0 - 3 | set 1: 9 - 25 | set 2: 17 - 25 | set 3: 12 - 25 | total: 38 - 75
- Row 2: date: 13 jul | score: 3 - 0 | set 1: 25 - 23 | set 2: 25 - 10 | set 3: 25 - 13 | total: 75 - 46

Assessment
- On July 13 (date recorded as “13 jul”), there are two matches in this table. In one of them, the third set score is exactly “12 - 25.” This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “July 13th” as any record with date strings equivalent to “13 jul”/“jul 13” in the available dataset.
- Interpreted “set 3 be 12 - 25” as the third set score equaling the string “12 - 25,” acknowledging minor formatting variations (spaces/hyphen) as equivalent.
- Scope limited to the discovered dataset (2002 FIVB Women’s Volleyball World Championship Qualification table).
