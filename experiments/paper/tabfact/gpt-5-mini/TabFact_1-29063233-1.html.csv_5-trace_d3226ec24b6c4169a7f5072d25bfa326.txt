Claim: “the sweet dream episode happen earlier in the series than the witchfinder.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows that in Merlin Series 2, “The Witchfinder” is episode 7 and “Sweet Dreams” is episode 10. Therefore, Sweet Dreams does not occur earlier; it occurs later.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL (TabFact) with a table public.merlin_series_2 containing Merlin Series 2 episode data.

Evidence and executed SQL:
- Query objective: Retrieve the episode numbers and air dates for the episodes titled “Sweet Dreams” and “The Witchfinder.”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, "no for series", "no overall", "original air date"
  FROM public.merlin_series_2
  WHERE lower(trim(title)) IN ('sweet dreams','the witchfinder')
  ORDER BY "no for series" ASC;
- Results (sorted by "no for series"):
  - title: the witchfinder; no for series: 7; no overall: 20; original air date: 7 november 2009
  - title: sweet dreams; no for series: 10; no overall: 23; original air date: 28 november 2009

Analysis:
- “The Witchfinder” (Episode 7) aired on 7 November 2009.
- “Sweet Dreams” (Episode 10) aired on 28 November 2009.
- Since 7 < 10 and the air date is earlier, “The Witchfinder” occurs earlier in the series than “Sweet Dreams,” contradicting the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the TV series “Merlin” (BBC) and specifically Series 2, since the available authoritative dataset is public.merlin_series_2 and it contains both episode titles in question.
- Title matching is case-insensitive and whitespace-trimmed, per the executed SQL.
