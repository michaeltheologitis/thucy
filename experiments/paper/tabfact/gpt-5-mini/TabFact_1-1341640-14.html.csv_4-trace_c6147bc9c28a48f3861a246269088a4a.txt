Claim interpreted: “Cardiss Collins was first elected as a Democrat in 1969.”

What I checked
- Located authoritative U.S. House elections data (1980) that includes an incumbent’s “first elected” year.
- Queried the table for Cardiss Collins to verify the year she was first elected.

Evidence from data
- Data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25), public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980
  WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Cardiss%';

- Result:
  - district: illinois 7
  - incumbent: cardiss collins
  - party: democratic
  - first elected: 1973
  - result: re - elected
  - candidates: cardiss collins (d) 85.1% ruth r hooper (r) 14.9%

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists Cardiss Collins as Democratic and shows her “first elected” year as 1973, not 1969.
- Therefore, the claim that she was first elected in 1969 is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- Cardiss Collins was first elected in 1973 (as reflected in the 1980 election table’s “first elected” field), not 1969.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to Cardiss Collins’s first election to the U.S. House of Representatives and her party affiliation (Democrat).
