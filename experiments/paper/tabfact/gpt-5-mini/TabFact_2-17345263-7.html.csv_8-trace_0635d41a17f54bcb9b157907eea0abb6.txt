Claim interpreted: “UAB was the opponent when they played at the Legion Field, Birmingham, AL site.” Here, “they” is assumed to refer to the East Carolina Pirates football team, based on the available data source (1990–1999 seasons).

What the data shows:
1) Search for any East Carolina games at Legion Field / Birmingham
- Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE LOWER(site) LIKE '%legion field%' OR LOWER(site) LIKE '%birmingham%'
ORDER BY date;
- Result:
  • date: october 17
    opponent: alabama
    site: legion field birmingham , al
    result: l22 - 23
    attendance: 80079

2) Check whether East Carolina played UAB in 1990–1999 and where
- Evidence (executed SQL 1):
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE '%UAB%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Birmingham%';
- Evidence (executed SQL 2):
SELECT date, opponent, site, result FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE '%uab%';
- Result:
  • date: october 10 | opponent: uab | site: dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc | result: w26 - 7

Conclusion:
- At the Legion Field Birmingham, AL site, East Carolina’s opponent was Alabama—not UAB.
- East Carolina did play UAB during 1990–1999, but that game was at Dowdy–Ficklen Stadium in Greenville, NC, not at Legion Field.

Answer: UAB was not the opponent at the Legion Field Birmingham, AL site; the opponent there was Alabama.

Assumptions:
- “They” refers to the East Carolina Pirates football team (the only team covered by the available dataset).
- The dataset covers games from 1990–1999; exact years are not encoded in the date column, which appears as month/day text.
