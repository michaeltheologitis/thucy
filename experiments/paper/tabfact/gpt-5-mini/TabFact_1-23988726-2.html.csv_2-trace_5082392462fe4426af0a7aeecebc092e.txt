Claim to verify: "the asian record be set on september 3rd 2004"

Data source discovery
- I discovered one PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing one table.

Evidence collected
1) List of user tables in the public schema
- SQL executed:
  SELECT tablename FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY tablename;
- Result:
  - my_info_table

2) Columns of public.my_info_table
- SQL executed:
  SELECT ordinal_position, column_name
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'my_info_table'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (ordinal_position — column_name):
  1 — world record
  2 — saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )
  3 — 7:53.63
  4 — brussels , belgium
  5 — 3 september 2004

3) Inspect data rows in public.my_info_table (up to 5 rows)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 5;
- Result (selected relevant row shown verbatim):
  Row 4:
    "world record" : "asian record"
    "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )" : "saif saaeed shaheen ( qat )"
    "7:53.63" : "7:53.63"
    "brussels , belgium" : "brussels , belgium"
    "3 september 2004" : "3 september 2004"

Assessment
- Row 4 explicitly links the record type "asian record" with the date value "3 september 2004". Therefore, the data supports that the Asian record was set on 3 September 2004.

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim as referring to the event described by the available table (athletics/steeplechase records) and that "september 3rd 2004" corresponds to the date format "3 september 2004" present in the data.
