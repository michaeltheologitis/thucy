Claim interpreted: There exists a record where the 'calling at' field includes "halton holegate , spilsby" and the service departs at 18.16.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns: departure (text), "going to" (text), "calling at" (text), arrival (double precision), operator (text)

Evidence gathered
1) Count matching records
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE ("calling at" ILIKE '%Halton Holegate%' OR "calling at" ILIKE '%Halton Holgate%')
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Spilsby%'
  AND (departure = '18.16' OR departure = '18:16');
Result:
- match_count = 1

2) Retrieve matching record(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT departure, "going to", "calling at", arrival, operator
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE ("calling at" ILIKE '%Halton Holegate%' OR "calling at" ILIKE '%Halton Holgate%')
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Spilsby%'
  AND (departure = '18.16' OR departure = '18:16');
Returned row:
- departure: '18.16'
  going to: 'spilsby'
  calling at: 'halton holegate , spilsby'
  arrival: 18.27
  operator: 'gnr'

Conclusion
- The table contains a record exactly matching the claim: a service with 'calling at' set to "halton holegate , spilsby" has a departure time of 18.16. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Matching for station names used case-insensitive substring search (ILIKE with wildcards) and allowed both spellings 'Halton Holegate' and 'Halton Holgate'.
- Departure time was matched as text against '18.16' or '18:16'.
