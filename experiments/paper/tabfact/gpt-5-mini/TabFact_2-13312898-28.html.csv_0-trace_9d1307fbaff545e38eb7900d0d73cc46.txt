Summary
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available data source: an Indianapolis Colts draft history table. I verified how many players were selected in Round 2 within this dataset.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact15) with table public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history.
- Schema details: columns = round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text).

Evidence
1) Full table view (to understand context and entries)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history ORDER BY round, pick;
Result excerpt (rows with round = 2 shown):
- round: 2 | pick: 4  | overall: 32 | name: ray donaldson | position: center | college: georgia
- round: 2 | pick: 23 | overall: 51 | name: tim foley     | position: offensive tackle | college: notre dame

2) Count of players selected in Round 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_selected FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 2;
Result:
- num_selected = 2

3) List the Round 2 players (for confirmation)
Executed SQL:
SELECT pick, overall, name, position, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 2 ORDER BY overall;
Result:
- pick = 4, overall = 32, name = ray donaldson, position = center, college = georgia
- pick = 23, overall = 51, name = tim foley, position = offensive tackle, college = notre dame

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 2 players were picked in the 2nd round. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available Indianapolis Colts draft dataset (which appears to represent a single draft year; the table lacks a year column). Interpreted “2 player be pick during the 2nd round of the draft” as “Two players were picked in the second round.”
