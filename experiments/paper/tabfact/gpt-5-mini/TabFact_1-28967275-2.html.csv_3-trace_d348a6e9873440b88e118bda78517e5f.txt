Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. Episode 40 of series 14 has the title “new order” (case-insensitive match to “New Order”).

Evidence from the database:
- Data source: postgres_tabfact19 (public schema), table: my_info_table
- Relevant columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 14 AND episode = 40;

Query result (single row):
- episode: 40
- series: 14
- episode title: new order
- original air date: 26 july 2008
- production code: 214

Interpretation: The returned row shows the episode title is “new order.” This directly matches the user’s claim when treating title capitalization as non-substantive.

Assumptions:
- The phrasing “episode 40 , series 14 be title new order” refers to the row where series = 14 and episode = 40 in the available episode metadata table.
- Capitalization differences ("new order" vs. "New Order") do not change the validity of the title match.
