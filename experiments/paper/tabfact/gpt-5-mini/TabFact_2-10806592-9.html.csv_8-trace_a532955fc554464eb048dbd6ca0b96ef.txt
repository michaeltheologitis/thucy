Row count check
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Result: total_rows = 6

2) Attendance comparison relative to 20,000 for 18 June 1938
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games,
       SUM(CASE WHEN crowd > 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS games_gt_20000,
       SUM(CASE WHEN crowd = 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS games_eq_20000,
       SUM(CASE WHEN crowd < 20000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS games_lt_20000
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE date = '18 june 1938';

Result: { total_games: 6, games_gt_20000: 0, games_eq_20000: 1, games_lt_20000: 5 }

ORDER BY crowd DESC;

Results (crowds): 20000, 18000, 14000, 13000, 12000, 7000

Assessment
- There are 6 games on 18 June 1938 in this dataset.
- None drew more than 20,000 spectators (0 games > 20,000); one drew exactly 20,000; five drew fewer than 20,000.
- Therefore, interpreted as “No game on 18 June drew a crowd of more than 20,000,” the claim is supported by the data.

Note on alternative reading
- If the intended claim was “No game on 18 June drew a crowd of fewer than 20,000,” it would be contradicted by the data (5 of 6 games are below 20,000).

Assumptions
- “18th of June” refers to the date value present in the dataset, which is stored as the literal text '18 june 1938'.
- The phrase “more fewer than 20000” is interpreted as “more than 20000,” given the contradictory wording and the dataset context.
