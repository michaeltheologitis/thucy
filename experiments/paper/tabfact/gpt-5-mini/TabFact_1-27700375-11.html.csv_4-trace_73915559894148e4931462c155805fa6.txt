Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 20;

Returned rows (7 total in table):
- game: 75, date: april 1, team: philadelphia, score: l 90 - 115 (ot), location attendance: wells fargo center 16695
- game: 76, date: april 3, team: miami, score: l 94 - 108 (ot), location attendance: prudential center 18711

Row count check:
Executed SQL:

Result: 7

2) Extract attendance as a number, identify the maximum, and confirm opponent and venue:
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance",
       substring("location attendance" FROM '^(.*) [0-9]+$') AS venue,
       CAST(substring("location attendance" FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
ORDER BY attendance DESC;

Key results (ordered by attendance descending):
- game: 76, date: april 3, team: miami, location attendance: prudential center 18711, venue: prudential center, attendance: 18711
- game: 79, date: april 8, team: new york, location attendance: prudential center 18023, venue: prudential center, attendance: 18023
- game: 80, date: april 10, team: toronto, location attendance: air canada centre 17755, venue: air canada centre, attendance: 17755
(remaining rows have lower attendance)

Interpretation
- The highest recorded attendance in the table is 18,711 for game 76 on April 3.
- Opponent for that game: Miami.
- Venue parsed from the same field: Prudential Center.
- Therefore, in this dataset, the most highly attended game was against Miami at the Prudential Center.

Assumptions
- The “team” column represents the Nets’ opponent.
- The “location attendance” field is structured as “venue_name attendanceNumber”, enabling regex parsing of the trailing numeric attendance and the preceding venue name.
- The claim is evaluated with respect to the available table (7 games from the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season as present in the database).
