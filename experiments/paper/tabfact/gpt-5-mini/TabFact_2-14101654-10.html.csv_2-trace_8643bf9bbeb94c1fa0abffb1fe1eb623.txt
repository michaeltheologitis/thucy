Summary
Claim: “no 2 player attend the same college / junior / club team (league).” Within the available dataset (public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season), every player’s “college / junior / club team (league)” entry is unique after normalization (trim + lowercasing). No affiliation appears for more than one player.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  - Columns: round; player; position; nationality; college / junior / club team (league)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count rows in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season;
- Result: total_rows = 11

2) List column names (to confirm schema)
- SQL:
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (ordered): round; player; position; nationality; college / junior / club team (league)

3) Check uniqueness of “college / junior / club team (league)” values (normalized)
- 3a) Non-null, non-empty count
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_null_non_empty
    FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
    WHERE "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL
      AND TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)") <> '';
  - Result: 11

- 3b) Distinct normalized affiliations (LOWER(TRIM(...)))
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LOWER(TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)"))) AS distinct_normalized
    FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
    WHERE "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL
      AND TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)") <> '';
  - Result: 11

- 3c) Enumerate affiliations, counts, and players (to detect duplicates)
  - SQL:
    SELECT LOWER(TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)")) AS norm_affil, COUNT(*) AS cnt, STRING_AGG(player, '; ' ORDER BY player) AS players
    FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
    WHERE "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL
      AND TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)") <> ''
    GROUP BY norm_affil
    ORDER BY cnt DESC, norm_affil;
  - Result (each cnt = 1):
    • brewster bulldogs (emjhl) | 1 | john carter
    • cape breton screaming eagles (qmjhl) | 1 | martin houle
    • centennial high school (minn) | 1 | r j anderson
    • halifax mooseheads (qmjhl) | 1 | frederik cabana
    • new england jr coyotes ( ejhl ) | 1 | rob bellamy

    • spišská nová ves (slovakia) | 1 | ladislav scurko
    • trail smoke eaters ( bchl ) | 1 | travis gawryletz
    • tri - city storm ( ushl ) | 1 | chris zarb
    • vancouver giants ( whl ) | 1 | triston grant

Conclusion
- All 11 players have unique normalized “college / junior / club team (league)” entries. No affiliation is shared by two or more players in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the table public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season, as it’s the only available dataset with the relevant column.
- “Same affiliation” was evaluated after normalization by trimming whitespace and lowercasing. Null/blank entries (none here) would be excluded from duplication checks.
