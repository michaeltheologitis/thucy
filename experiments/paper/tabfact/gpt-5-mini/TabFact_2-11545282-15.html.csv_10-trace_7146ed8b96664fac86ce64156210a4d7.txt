Claim interpreted: The player in the roster whose school/club team is Efes Pilsen (Turkey) has the position “center”.

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact15 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Exact string match for the club
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" = 'Efes Pilsen (Turkey)';
Result: No rows returned (no exact case/spacing match).

2) Case-insensitive, relaxed match for the club name
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Efes%';
Result:
- player: mehmet okur
  position: forward - center
  school / club team: efes pilsen ( turkey )

3) Comprehensive case-insensitive search for consistency
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, nationality, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower("school / club team") LIKE '%efes%';
Result:
- player: mehmet okur
  nationality: turkey
  position: forward - center
  school / club team: efes pilsen ( turkey )

Assessment:
- The only roster entry linked to Efes Pilsen is Mehmet Okur, whose position is recorded as “forward - center,” not solely “center.”
- Therefore, the claim that the position is “center” is only partially supported; the data indicates a dual position including center.

Assumptions:
- Treated “Efes Pilsen (Turkey)” as equivalent to the recorded value “efes pilsen ( turkey )” (differences only in case and spacing).
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Utah Jazz all-time roster entry whose school/club team is Efes Pilsen (Turkey).
