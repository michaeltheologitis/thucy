Interpretation of the claim:
- I interpret the statement "alberta be the locale when l be 9" as asserting that in the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table, the row(s) with l (losses) = 9 have locale = 'alberta'.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact33), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier(locale text, skip text, w bigint, l bigint, pf bigint, pa bigint, "ends won" bigint, "ends lost" bigint, "blank ends" bigint, "stolen ends" bigint, "shot pct" text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check whether any row has l = 9
SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE l = 9;
Result: count = 0
Interpretation: There are no rows where l (losses) equals 9.

2) Inspect the distribution of l values (top by losses)
SQL:
SELECT locale, skip, w, l, pf, pa, "ends won", "ends lost" FROM t_2005_tim_hortons_brier ORDER BY l DESC, locale LIMIT 100;
Returned sample (top rows by l):
- new brunswick; wade blanchard; w:3; l:8; pf:56; pa:83; ends won:41; ends lost:45
- northern ontario; mike jakubo; w:3; l:8; pf:64; pa:86; ends won:41; ends lost:48
- prince edward island; rod macdonald; w:4; l:7; pf:67; pa:85; ends won:41; ends lost:51
- british columbia; deane horning; w:6; l:5; pf:72; pa:65; ends won:47; ends lost:45
- newfoundland and labrador; brad gushue; w:6; l:5; pf:76; pa:69; ends won:48; ends lost:45
- ontario; wayne middaugh; w:6; l:5; pf:75; pa:62; ends won:42; ends lost:46
- saskatchewan; pat simmons; w:6; l:5; pf:66; pa:61; ends won:43; ends lost:45
- quebec; jean - michel mãnard; w:7; l:4; pf:77; pa:69; ends won:54; ends lost:40
- manitoba; randy dutiaume; w:8; l:3; pf:77; pa:69; ends won:47; ends lost:44
- nova scotia; shawn adams; w:8; l:3; pf:80; pa:60; ends won:47; ends lost:41
- alberta; randy ferbey; w:9; l:2; pf:90; pa:58; ends won:48; ends lost:43
Interpretation: The maximum l in this table is 8. There are no entries with l = 9.

3) Verify Alberta’s actual w and l
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE locale = 'alberta';
Result row:
- locale: alberta; skip: randy ferbey; w: 9; l: 2; pf: 90; pa: 58; ends won: 48; ends lost: 43; blank ends: 7; stolen ends: 9; shot pct: 86%
Interpretation: Alberta’s row shows l = 2, not 9.

Conclusion:
- The data shows there are no rows with l = 9 at all, and Alberta’s entry specifically has l = 2. Therefore, the claim that "Alberta be the locale when l be 9" is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- I interpreted "l" as the losses column in t_2005_tim_hortons_brier and "be the locale" as referring to the locale value for rows meeting the condition l = 9. If a different dataset or a condition like w = 9 was intended, the claim would not match this interpretation and would need re-verification under that alternative meaning.
