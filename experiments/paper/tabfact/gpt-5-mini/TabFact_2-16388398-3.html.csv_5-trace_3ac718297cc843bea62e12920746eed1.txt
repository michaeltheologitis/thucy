Summary conclusion
- In the available sports fixtures table (t_2000_ansett_australia_cup), the match on the date string "monday , 14 february" lists Geelong (home) vs Melbourne (away). St Kilda is not the away team on that date. St Kilda appears as the away team on "sunday , 30 january" and "sunday , 13 february" instead.

Data sources inspected
- Database: TabFact (treated as authoritative per instructions)
- Relevant table discovered: t_2000_ansett_australia_cup (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", ground, crowd, date)

2) List all matches where St Kilda were the away team
- SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team" FROM t_2000_ansett_australia_cup WHERE lower("away team") = 'st kilda';
