Schema context:
- Table: t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  - Columns: round (bigint), player (text), position (text), nationality (text), "college / junior / club team (league)" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
- SQL executed to count players per nationality:
  SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  GROUP BY nationality
  ORDER BY cnt DESC, nationality;

- Results returned by the query:
  - canada: 5
  - united states: 5
