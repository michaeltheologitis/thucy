Objective interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as: “The Wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in 10 games.”
- Given available data, the most relevant entity is the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team.

Evidence from data
1) Count how many games the opponent scored 0
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_opponent_count FROM public."t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team" WHERE "opponents" = 0;
Result:
- zero_opponent_count = 4

2) List the specific shutout games (opponent scored 0)

- game: 9, date: nov 15, opponent: evansville, result: win, opponents: 0

Conclusion
- The available authoritative data shows the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats kept opponents scoreless in 4 games, not 10. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data available.

Assumptions
