Conclusion
- In the available season dataset (2008–09 NBL), Gold Coast Blaze had the lowest win percentage (26.67%), which constitutes the worst record among listed teams in that season. The claim is supported for this season.

Assumptions
- “the season” is interpreted as the 2008–09 NBL season because this is the season table available in the connected data source. If a different season was intended, additional season tables would be needed to verify across those seasons.
