Claim to verify: “Galina Voskoboeva plays 20% of her games on a clay top tennis court.”

Data source discovery
- Using the connected data environment, I discovered one relevant PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact11 / TabFact) with a single pertinent table:
  - public.galina_voskoboeva (columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score; all text)

Schema details (from inspection)
- Table: public.galina_voskoboeva
  - Columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)
  - No primary/foreign keys reported.

Evidence collected
1) Total matches, clay matches, and percentage of clay
Executed SQL:
WITH totals AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*)::bigint AS total
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
),
clay AS (
  SELECT COUNT(*)::bigint AS clay
  FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
  WHERE LOWER(TRIM(surface)) = 'clay'
)
SELECT clay.clay, totals.total, ROUND(100.0 * clay.clay / NULLIF(totals.total,0), 2) AS pct_clay
FROM totals CROSS JOIN clay;

Result:
- clay = 2
- total = 5
- pct_clay = 40.00

2) Distribution by surface (to confirm surface labels)
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  COALESCE(NULLIF(TRIM(surface),''),'Unknown') AS surface_normalized,
  COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY surface_normalized
ORDER BY count DESC, surface_normalized;

Result rows:
- clay -> 2
- hard (i) -> 2
- hard -> 1

Analysis
- In the authoritative dataset available, Galina Voskoboeva has 5 recorded matches, 2 of which are on clay. This yields 40.00% on clay, not 20%.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. The observed percentage of matches on clay is 40%, which contradicts the stated 20%.

Assumptions and interpretation
- Interpreted “play 20% of her game” as “20% of her matches.”
- Interpreted “clay top tennis court” as the clay surface (surface = 'clay').
- Treated the connected dataset (public.galina_voskoboeva) as authoritative for verification, per instructions.
