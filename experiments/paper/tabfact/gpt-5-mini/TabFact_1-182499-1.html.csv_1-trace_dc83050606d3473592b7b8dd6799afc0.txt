Claim being checked:
- "The substrate for ALA–dehydratase deficiency porphyria is δ-aminolevulinic acid."

Data sources explored:
- TabFact database, public schema. Identified a relevant table: public.porphyrin with columns [enzyme, location, substrate, product, chromosome, ec, omim, porphyria].

Evidence from data:
- We searched for rows related to ALA dehydratase/its deficiency porphyria and inspected the substrate and product fields.

Executed SQL (as run):
SELECT enzyme, porphyria, substrate, product, ec
FROM public.porphyrin
WHERE porphyria ILIKE '%dehydratase%'
   OR enzyme ILIKE '%dehydratase%';

Result:
- enzyme: ala dehydratase
- porphyria: ala - dehydratase deficiency
- substrate: δ - aminolevulinic acid
- product: porphobilinogen
- ec: 4.2.1.24

Assessment:
- The porphyrin table explicitly lists δ-aminolevulinic acid as the substrate for the enzyme ALA dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.24), and the associated porphyria entry is "ala - dehydratase deficiency." This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data: for ALA–dehydratase deficiency porphyria, the substrate listed is δ-aminolevulinic acid.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing to mean: "In ALA dehydratase deficiency porphyria, the relevant enzyme’s substrate is δ-aminolevulinic acid."
