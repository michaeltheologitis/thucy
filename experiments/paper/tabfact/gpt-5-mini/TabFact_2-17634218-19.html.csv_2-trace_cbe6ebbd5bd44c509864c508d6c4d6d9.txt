Claim: "the only total that appear more than 2 time be 22"

Data sources explored:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table used: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
- Relevant column: total (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify all values of the column total that occur more than 2 times.
Executed SQL:
SELECT total, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY total
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY freq DESC, total;

Result:
- total = 22, freq = 3

Conclusion:
- The only value of total that appears more than 2 times is 22, and it appears 3 times. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “total” as the column named total in the only accessible table (public.list_of_sumo_record_holders) of the available data source.
