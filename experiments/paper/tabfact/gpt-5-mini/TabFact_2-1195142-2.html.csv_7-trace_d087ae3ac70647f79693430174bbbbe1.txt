Claim to verify: “Jerry Mitchell win 2 Tony award.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18), schema: public
- Tables found: la_cage_aux_folles_musical(year bigint, award text, category text, nominee text, result text)

Step 1 — Inspect all award records for Jerry Mitchell in available data
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Jerry Mitchell%';

Results:
1) year: 2005, award: tony award, category: best choreography, nominee: jerry mitchell, result: won
2) year: 2005, award: drama desk award, category: outstanding choreography, nominee: jerry mitchell, result: won

Step 2 — Count Tony Award wins for Jerry Mitchell in available data
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS win_count
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Jerry Mitchell%'
  AND award ILIKE '%Tony%'
  AND (result ILIKE '%win%' OR result ILIKE '%won%');

Query result:
- win_count = 1

Findings:
- The available dataset (limited to awards related to “La Cage aux Folles”) shows Jerry Mitchell with 1 Tony Award win (Best Choreography, 2005), plus a Drama Desk Award win the same year.
- The data at hand does not show evidence of a second Tony Award win. It neither confirms nor explicitly denies additional Tony Awards outside the scope of this table.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Jerry Mitchell “won 2 Tony Awards” is not fully supported by the available data. The data verifies at least one Tony Award win but does not provide evidence of a second.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The only accessible table is la_cage_aux_folles_musical. It does not cover all of Jerry Mitchell’s career or all Tony Awards across all productions. “Win” was interpreted as result values containing “win” or “won,” case-insensitively.
