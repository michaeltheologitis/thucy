Interpretation of the claim: The statement "when the record be 11 - 32 - 11, the score be 7 - 2" is taken to mean that there exists at least one row in the available dataset where the record field equals "11 - 32 - 11" and the corresponding score equals "7 - 2".

Data source discovery:
- One accessible PostgreSQL database was found: postgres_tabfact27 (public schema).

Schema inspected:
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all games where record = '11 - 32 - 11'
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11';
Result:
- date: february 3; visitor: ny islanders; home: new jersey; score: 7 - 2; record: 11 - 32 - 11

2) Count rows with that record and list distinct scores (to check consistency)
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11';
Result: cnt = 1

Executed SQL (distinct scores):
SELECT DISTINCT score FROM public.my_info_table WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11' ORDER BY score;
Result: 7 - 2

Assessment:
- The dataset contains exactly one row with record = "11 - 32 - 11", and its score is "7 - 2". This directly supports the claim as interpreted above.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the existence of such an entry rather than asserting a universal rule.
- Matching is done on exact string formatting (including spaces around dashes) as stored in the table.
- public.my_info_table is the authoritative source for this verification.
