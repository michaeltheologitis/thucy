What I checked
- Data source discovery identified a single relevant table: t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (TabFact / postgres_tabfact14), which contains per-game leaders including “high rebounds” for the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season.

Evidence from the data
1) Top distinct single‑game rebound totals (parsed from the “high rebounds” column) and sample rows
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT game, date, "high rebounds",
    CASE WHEN "high rebounds" LIKE '%(%' THEN trim(trailing ')' FROM split_part("high rebounds", '(', 2))::int ELSE NULL END AS rebounds_int
  FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
),
 top5 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT rebounds_int FROM parsed WHERE rebounds_int IS NOT NULL ORDER BY rebounds_int DESC LIMIT 5
)
SELECT DISTINCT ON (p.rebounds_int) p.rebounds_int, p.game, p.date, p."high rebounds"
FROM parsed p
JOIN top5 t USING (rebounds_int)
ORDER BY p.rebounds_int DESC, p.date ASC;

Result (rebounds_int | game | date | "high rebounds"):
- 20 | 51 | february 10 | nazr mohammed (20)
- 17 | 48 | february 3  | nazr mohammed (17)
- 12 | 53 | february 19 | tyrus thomas (12)
- 11 | 54 | february 20 | tyrus thomas (11)
- 10 | 47 | february 1  | gerald wallace (10)

2) Player(s) and dates for the top two rebound totals
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT game, date, "high rebounds",
    CASE WHEN "high rebounds" LIKE '%(%' THEN trim(trailing ')' FROM split_part("high rebounds", '(', 2))::int ELSE NULL END AS rebounds_int,
    trim(both ' ' FROM split_part("high rebounds", '(', 1)) AS player_text
  FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
),
 top2 AS (
  SELECT DISTINCT rebounds_int FROM parsed WHERE rebounds_int IS NOT NULL ORDER BY rebounds_int DESC LIMIT 2
 )
SELECT p.rebounds_int, trim(both ' ' FROM regexp_split_to_table(p.player_text, ',')) AS player, p.date, p.game, p."high rebounds"
FROM parsed p
JOIN top2 t USING (rebounds_int)
ORDER BY p.rebounds_int DESC, p.date ASC;

Result (rebounds_int | player | date | game | "high rebounds"):
- 20 | nazr mohammed | february 10 | 51 | nazr mohammed (20)
- 17 | nazr mohammed | february 3  | 48 | nazr mohammed (17)

Findings
- In the available dataset (2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season), the highest single‑game rebound total is 20 (Nazr Mohammed, Feb 10). The second‑highest is 17 (Nazr Mohammed, Feb 3).
- Therefore, the statement that the second most rebounds by a Bobcats player in one game is 20 is contradicted by the data in this source.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “bobcat player” as a Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) player.
- Verified within the scope of the only available relevant dataset (the 2009–10 season table). No franchise‑wide table was available in the connected data source.
