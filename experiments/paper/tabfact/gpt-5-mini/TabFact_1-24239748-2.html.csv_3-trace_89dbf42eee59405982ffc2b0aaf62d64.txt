Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  - Columns: county; exports (us mil); percent of total exports; imports (us mil); percent of total imports

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Locate the record for “centru” and retrieve its export/import percentages.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "county", "percent of total exports", "percent of total imports"
FROM list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
WHERE "county" ILIKE '%centru%';

Result:
- county: centru
- percent of total exports: 12.8 %
- percent of total imports: 11.8 %

Assessment:
- Claimed: exports = 13.8%, imports = 11.2%
- Found: exports = 12.8%, imports = 11.8%
Both claimed percentages differ from the data (by 1.0 and 0.6 percentage points, respectively). These are not minor rounding differences, so the claim is not supported by the dataset.

Assumptions:
- “centru county” refers to the row labeled “centru” in the county column.
- Case-insensitive matching was used to find the relevant row.
- The TabFact public table is treated as the authoritative source for this verification.
