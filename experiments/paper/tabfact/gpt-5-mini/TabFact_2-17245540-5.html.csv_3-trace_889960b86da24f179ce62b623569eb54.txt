Summary of verification
- Context: The only available data source is a table of results for the 1973 U.S. Open Golf (public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf). I interpret the claim as stating that, in this tournament, Tom Weiskopf is from the United States and finished tied for 6th (T6).

Data source discovery
- Discovered databases: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: t_1973_u_s_open_golf

Schema details (from inspection)
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)

Evidence
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Weiskopf%';
- Result row:
  { place: "t6", player: "tom weiskopf", country: "united states" }

Conclusion
- The data shows Tom Weiskopf’s country as "united states" and his place as "t6". This supports the claim that he is from the United States and finished T6 (tied for 6th) in the 1973 U.S. Open Golf.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1973 U.S. Open Golf, as that is the only accessible dataset and table concerning Tom Weiskopf available through the connected data sources.
