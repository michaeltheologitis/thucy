Summary
- Claim: On August 15, 2012, the team booked a win in a friendly competition match.
- Finding: Supported by the data.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact (postgres_tabfact1)” with a public schema.

Relevant schema
- Table: public.branimir_suba_i
  - Columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)
  - This table contains match-like records including date, competition type, and match outcome.

Evidence from data
- Retrieved row for the target date shows a friendly match with a win:
  - date: august 15 , 2012
  - competition: friendly
  - result: win
  - score: 3 - 0
  - venue: baku , azerbaijan

Executed SQL (evidence)
SELECT date, competition, result, score, venue
FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE date ILIKE '%2012%'
  AND (
    date ILIKE '%Aug%15%'
    OR date ILIKE '%August%15%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15%Aug%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15%August%'
    OR date ILIKE '%08/15/2012%'
    OR date ILIKE '%8/15/2012%'
    OR date ILIKE '%2012-08-15%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15-Aug-2012%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15 August 2012%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15.08.2012%'
    OR date ILIKE '%15/08/2012%'
  );

Assessment
- The row explicitly indicates a “win” in a “friendly” on “august 15 , 2012.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “The team” refers to the team represented by entries in public.branimir_suba_i. The table does not name the team explicitly, but it records match outcomes that are treated as authoritative within this data source.
- Dates are matched textually; the found entry exactly matches “august 15 , 2012,” confirming the intended date.
