Claim to verify: "on april 17 the home team be the chicago black hawk and the record be 2 - 3"

Data source consulted: TabFact (public schema), table: t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text).

Findings:
- The dataset contains an entry for April 17 in the 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks season where:
  - date: april 17
  - visitor: detroit red wings
  - score: 5 - 3
  - home: chicago black hawks
  - record: 2 - 3
- This directly supports that on April 17 the home team was the Chicago Black Hawks and the "record" field was 2 - 3.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) Broad April 17 search to locate candidate rows:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%Apr%17%' OR date ILIKE '%April%17%' OR date ILIKE '%Apr 17%' OR date ILIKE '%April 17%' OR date ILIKE '%4/17%';

Result returned:
- date: april 17; visitor: detroit red wings; score: 5 - 3; home: chicago black hawks; record: 2 - 3

2) Targeted confirmation filtering by home team and date:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season
WHERE home = 'chicago black hawks' AND date ILIKE '%April 17%';

Result returned:
- date: april 17; visitor: detroit red wings; score: 5 - 3; home: chicago black hawks; record: 2 - 3

Conclusion: The data confirms the claim as stated (allowing for the minor spelling/pluralization difference "black hawk" vs "Black Hawks").

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the April 17 entry in the 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks season dataset available in the connected database.
- Treated "black hawk" as a typographical variant of the team name "Chicago Black Hawks."
- Interpreted "record be 2 - 3" as referring to the value in the table’s "record" column for that game.
