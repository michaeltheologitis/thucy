Summary
- I explored the available database and found a single relevant table: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix, which contains driver-to-entrant mappings for the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix. I verified the two statements against this table.

Data source inspection
- Database: postgres_tabfact3 (schema: public)
- Table: t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  - Columns: driver (text), entrant (text), constructor (text), chassis (text), engine (text), tyre (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve entrants for Harry Schell and Philippe Étancelin
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE driver IN ('harry schell', 'philippe étancelin');
- Result:
  - harry schell — entrant: ecurie bleue
  - philippe étancelin — entrant: private

(Additional discovery queries were used to locate the data source and schema; the above SQL produced the direct evidence for verification.)

Assessment of the claims
- Claim A: “When the driver is Harry Schell the entrant is Scuderia Ambrosiana.”
  - Finding: In the table, Harry Schell’s entrant is “ecurie bleue,” not “Scuderia Ambrosiana.”
  - Status: False per the evidence.

- Claim B: “When the driver is Philippe Étancelin the entrant is SA Alfa Romeo.”
  - Finding: In the table, Philippe Étancelin’s entrant is “private,” not “SA Alfa Romeo.”
  - Status: False per the evidence.

Conclusion
- Both stated mappings are contradicted by the data in the t_1950_swiss_grand_prix table.

Assumptions
- Scope: I interpreted the claim as referring to the mappings present in the available dataset (1950 Swiss Grand Prix entries), since this is the only accessible authoritative source in the environment.
