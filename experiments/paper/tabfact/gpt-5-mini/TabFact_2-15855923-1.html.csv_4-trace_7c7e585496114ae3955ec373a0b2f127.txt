Summary
- Claim interpreted as: within the available dataset, there exists a record where, in the same event/row, result = '3 - 2' while score = '2 - 0'.
- Data source: PostgreSQL (TabFact), schema public. Only available table: public.kwak_tae_hwi with columns (date text, venue text, score text, result text, competition text).

Schema examined
- Table: public.kwak_tae_hwi
  - Columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)
  - No keys defined

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Understand value formats for score and result
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT score, result FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi ORDER BY score NULLS LAST, result NULLS LAST;
- Key results (score -> result):
  - "1 - 0" -> "4 - 0"
  - "2 - 0" -> "2 - 0"
  - "2 - 1" -> "4 - 1"
  - "3 - 2" -> "3 - 2"
  - "4 - 1" -> "4 - 1"

2) Directly test the claimed combination (result = '3 - 2' AND score = '2 - 0')
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2' AND score = '2 - 0';
- Result: match_count = 0

3) List rows where result = '3 - 2' (for context)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2';
- Result:
  - date: february 17 , 2008; venue: chongqing , china; score: 3 - 2; result: 3 - 2; competition: 2008 east asian cup

4) List rows where score = '2 - 0' (for context)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '2 - 0';
- Result:
  - date: march 3 , 2010; venue: london , england; score: 2 - 0; result: 2 - 0; competition: friendly

Analysis
- The table shows that score and result can differ in some rows (e.g., 1 - 0 -> 4 - 0), indicating they capture different moments/outcomes. However, there is no row in this dataset where result = '3 - 2' and score = '2 - 0' simultaneously.

Conclusion
- The specific claimed combination does not occur in the available authoritative data. Therefore, the claim is not supported.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to a single-row event within the only accessible dataset (public.kwak_tae_hwi) and uses exact string formats '3 - 2' and '2 - 0'.
- No other relevant datasets are available through the provided connectors/tools.
