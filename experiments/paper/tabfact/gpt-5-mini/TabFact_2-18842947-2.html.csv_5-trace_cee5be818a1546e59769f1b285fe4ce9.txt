Summary of available data sources
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact19), schema: public. One relevant table found: t_1976_detroit_lions_season.

Relevant table
- public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance). This appears to store per-game outcomes for the 1976 Detroit Lions NFL season.

Evidence from data
1) Determine how outcomes are encoded
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Results (distinct values observed):
- "l 20 - 17"
- "w 30 - 10"
- "w 27 - 6"
- "l 10 - 9"
- "w 27 - 14"
- "l 31 - 23"
- "l 24 - 14"
- "l 24 - 10"
- "l 17 - 16"
- "l 10 - 3"
- "w 14 - 10"
- "l 20 - 7"
- "w 41 - 14"
- "w 24 - 10"
Interpretation: results begin with 'w' for wins and 'l' for losses; no ties present.

2) Compute total wins and losses for the season
SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
  COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result:
- wins: 6
- losses: 8
- total_games: 14

3) (Additional check) Record after the first 12 games
SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN result ILIKE 'W%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN result ILIKE 'L%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE week <= 12;
Result:
- wins: 6
- losses: 6

Assessment relative to the claim
- The available data shows the Detroit Lions finished the 1976 season with a 6–8 record, not 4–8. Even after 12 games, their record was 6–6, not 4–8.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the lion finish with a record of 4 win and 8 loss” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and interpretation notes
- Interpreted “the lion” as the Detroit Lions, as the only accessible dataset pertains to the 1976 Detroit Lions season.
- Interpreted “finish with a record” as the final season record.
- Trusted the TabFact database contents as authoritative within their scope, per instructions.
