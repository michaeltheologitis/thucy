Claim to verify: “week 8 have the lowest attendance during the first 10 week, at 61603.”

Data source discovery
- Available sources: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact14), public schema.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season with columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint). This table tracks attendance by week.

Evidence from data (exact SQL and results)
1) List attendance for weeks 1–10, ordered by week
SQL:
SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10 ORDER BY week;
Results (week, attendance):
- week 2: 64006
- week 3: 45653
- week 4: 68481
- week 5: 61535
- week 6: 63406
- week 7: 54328
- week 8: 61603
- week 9: 73118
- week 10: 54759
Note: No row for week 1 appears in this range.

2) Minimum attendance among weeks 1–10
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
Result:
- min_attendance = 45653

3) Week(s) with the minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10 AND attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10) ORDER BY week;
Result:
- week 3: 45653

4) Ranking of weeks 1–10 by attendance (lowest → highest)
SQL:
SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10 ORDER BY attendance ASC, week ASC;
Results (lowest → highest):
1) Week 3 — 45653
2) Week 7 — 54328
3) Week 10 — 54759
4) Week 5 — 61535
5) Week 8 — 61603
6) Week 6 — 63406
7) Week 2 — 64006
8) Week 4 — 68481
9) Week 9 — 73118

5) Count of weeks present in 1–10 (to confirm any missing)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
Result:
- cnt = 9 (indicating week 1 is missing in this range)

Assessment of the claim
- “Week 8 … at 61603”: Supported. Week 8 attendance is 61,603.
- “… have the lowest attendance during the first 10 week”: Not supported. The lowest attendance among weeks 1–10 is 45,653 in week 3. Week 8’s 61,603 is higher than multiple other weeks and ranks 5th-lowest among the available weeks 2–10.

Conclusion
- The numeric value for week 8 (61,603) is correct, but the assertion that week 8 has the lowest attendance in the first 10 weeks is contradicted by the data. The lowest is week 3 with 45,653.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “first 10 week” as weeks numbered 1 through 10 in table t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season.
- Treated the absence of week 1 as no data for that week rather than assuming any value.
- Interpreted the dataset context as the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season based on the table name.
