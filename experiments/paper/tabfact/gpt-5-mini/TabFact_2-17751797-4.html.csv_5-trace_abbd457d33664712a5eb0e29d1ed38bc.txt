Claim interpreted: “1-0 be the score when the home team be Wimbledon.” I interpret this as asserting that there exists at least one match in the available data where the home team is Wimbledon and the score is 1-0.

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact14
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup (columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date")

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for any match with home team = Wimbledon and score = 1-0
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" = 'Wimbledon' AND "score" = '1-0' ORDER BY "date";
Result: No rows matched (empty result set).

2) Check whether Wimbledon appears as a home team at all (exact match)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" = 'Wimbledon';
Result: cnt = 0

3) Check whether Wimbledon appears as a home team in any case-insensitive/substring form
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%wimbledon%';
Result: count = 0

4) Context check: does Wimbledon appear at all (home or away)?
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%wimbledon%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%wimbledon%';
Result:
- tie no: 6, home team: shrewsbury town, score: 1 - 0, away team: wimbledon, date: 26 / 01 / 1991
Interpretation: The only Wimbledon occurrence in this table is as the away team in a 1-0 loss at Shrewsbury Town. There are no rows with Wimbledon as the home team.

Conclusion:
- Within the available data (1990–91 FA Cup table), there are no matches where Wimbledon is the home team, and therefore no evidence that “1-0” is the score when the home team is Wimbledon. The closest related record shows a 1-0 score with Wimbledon away, not home.

Assumptions:
- Scope is limited to the discovered dataset (postgres_tabfact14, public.t_1990_91_fa_cup). No other football match tables were discoverable with the required columns.
- “Wimbledon” was matched case-insensitively and as a substring to guard against naming variations; none appeared for home team.
- The claim is evaluated against this dataset only, which the instructions designate as authoritative within its scope.
