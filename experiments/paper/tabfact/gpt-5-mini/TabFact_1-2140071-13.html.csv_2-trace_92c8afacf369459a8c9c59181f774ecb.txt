Conclusion
- The dataset shows that Season 13, Episode 5 has an episode summary exactly equal to "rita is made into an actress". The table does not contain an episode title column, so I cannot confirm this as the episode’s official title. Based on available data, the phrase matches the episode summary for episode 5.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Find all rows where episode number equals 5
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE episode = 5 ORDER BY season;
- Result:
  season: 13 | episode: 5 | episode summary: "rita is made into an actress"

2) Context: total rows in the table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.made_tv_series;
- Result:
  row_count = 15

3) Cross-check: any rows mentioning “rita” or “actress”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE "episode summary" ILIKE '%rita%' OR "episode summary" ILIKE '%actress%';
- Results:
  - 13 | 1  | cara is made into an actress
  - 13 | 5  | rita is made into an actress
  - 13 | 14 | emilly and jeanette are made into actresses

Assessment
- Supported: The exact phrase “rita is made into an actress” appears for episode 5 (Season 13) in the episode summary field.
- Not supported/unknown: Whether this phrase is the official episode title, because the dataset lacks a title column.

Assumptions
- “Episode 5” refers to the episode with numeric episode value 5 in the available dataset.
- The show in question is the one represented by the public.made_tv_series table.
- “Title” was interpreted as possibly referring to the text available in the "episode summary" field because no dedicated title field exists in this dataset.
