Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a structured table relevant to the claim.
- Inspected the schema to confirm relevant columns exist.
- Queried the table to retrieve the row(s) for class "vesuvius" and examined the wheel arrangement, quantity made, and quantity preserved.

Data source discovery
- Found one accessible source: a PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact2), public schema, containing table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway.

Schema context (relevant parts)
- Table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
- Columns: class (text), wheel arrangement (text), quantity made (text), quantity preserved (text), plus other metadata fields.

Evidence query and result
Executed SQL:
SELECT class, "wheel arrangement", "quantity made", "quantity preserved" 
FROM locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE lower(class) LIKE '%vesuvius%';

Result (1 row):
- class: vesuvius
- wheel arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0
- quantity made: 32
- quantity preserved: 0
