Claim: “the city of license for W282AE be Macon, Georgia and the city of license for W290AG be Griffin, Georgia.”

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5), schema: public
- Relevant table: wyfk with columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (text), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
- SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w282ae','w290ag');

- Results:
  - call sign: w282ae — city of license: macon , georgia
  - call sign: w290ag — city of license: griffin , georgia

Assessment:
- W282AE: Listed city of license is “macon , georgia,” which corresponds to Macon, Georgia. Supported.
- W290AG: Listed city of license is “griffin , georgia,” which corresponds to Griffin, Georgia. Supported.

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Matching was case-insensitive on the "call sign" field.
- Minor formatting (lowercase and extra spaces around commas) does not alter the semantic equivalence to “Macon, Georgia” and “Griffin, Georgia.”
