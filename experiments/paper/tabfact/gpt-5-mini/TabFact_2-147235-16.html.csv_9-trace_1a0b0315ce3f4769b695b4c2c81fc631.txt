Claim to verify: “錢 and 斤 be the only character that have metric value measure in g.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement, containing text fields for character, jyutping, relative value, metric value, and imperial value.

Evidence
1) Check the entries for 錢 and 斤
Executed SQL:
SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('斤','錢');
Results:
- 錢 — metric value: 3.779936375 g; relative value: 1 / 160
- 斤 — metric value: 604.78982 g; relative value: 1

2) Find all characters whose metric value is expressed specifically in grams (unit exactly “g”, not mg or kg)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT character, "metric value" AS metric_value
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '% g' AND "metric value" NOT ILIKE '%mg%' AND "metric value" NOT ILIKE '%kg%'
ORDER BY character;
Results:
- 兩 — 37.79936375 g
- 斤 — 604.78982 g
- 錢 — 3.779936375 g

Assessment
- The dataset shows that, in addition to 斤 and 錢, the character 兩 also has a metric value expressed in grams. Therefore, 錢 and 斤 are not the only characters with metric values in grams.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “metric value measure in g” is interpreted as entries whose metric value unit is exactly grams (“g”), excluding milligrams (mg) and kilograms (kg).
- “character” refers to the Chinese unit character field in the table.
- Verification is based on the single authoritative table discovered in the accessible database.
