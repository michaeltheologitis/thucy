Summary conclusion
- Supported by data: W230AV has city of license “Gadsden, Alabama” and W269AX has city of license “Anniston, Alabama”.

What data I checked
1) Discovered available data sources
- Tool/action: Discover data sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact3 / TabFact) with a public schema is available.

2) Identified relevant table and columns
- Tool/action: Schema inspection
- Result: Table public.wyfk with columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (text), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text).

Evidence queries and results
1) Initial exact-uppercase check (to test casing)
Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" IN ('W230AV','W269AX');
Result:
[{"count":0}]
Interpretation: No rows with uppercase call sign values, indicating call signs are stored differently (e.g., lowercase) in the table.

2) Sample inspection to verify casing and city formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk ORDER BY "call sign" LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt):
[{"call sign":"w230av","city of license":"gadsden , alabama"},
 {"call sign":"w269ax","city of license":"anniston , alabama"},
 {"call sign":"w273ae","city of license":"albany , georgia"},
 {"call sign":"w282ae","city of license":"macon , georgia"},
 {"call sign":"w290ag","city of license":"griffin , georgia"}]
Interpretation: Call signs are stored in lowercase; cities/states are stored in lowercase with a comma.

3) Final case-insensitive retrieval for the two target call signs
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w230av','w269ax');
Result:
[{"call sign":"w230av","city of license":"gadsden , alabama"},
 {"call sign":"w269ax","city of license":"anniston , alabama"}]

Assessment of the claim
- W230AV — city of license in data: gadsden , alabama → matches “Gadsden, Alabama”.
- W269AX — city of license in data: anniston , alabama → matches “Anniston, Alabama”.
Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The comparison ignores letter case and minor punctuation/spacing differences; city/state strings in the source are lowercase with a space before/after the comma, which I interpret as equivalent to the properly capitalized forms.
