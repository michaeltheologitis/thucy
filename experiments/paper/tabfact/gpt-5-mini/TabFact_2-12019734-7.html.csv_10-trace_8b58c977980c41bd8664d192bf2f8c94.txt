Claim to verify: “the game on february 4th have new jersey as the home team.”

Summary finding: The available game data contains several February dates but none on February 4. Therefore, there is no game on February 4 in this dataset, and the claim cannot be supported.

Data source discovery
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified by schema inspection: public.my_info_table with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) What February dates exist in the data?
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM my_info_table WHERE date ILIKE '%feb%';
Results:
- february 12
- february 20
- february 21
- february 27
- february 5
- february 9
- february 3
- february 15
- february 6
- february 26
- february 24
Interpretation: February dates are present, but “february 4” is not among them.

2) Is there any row that could represent February 4 (including possible abbreviations)?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM my_info_table WHERE date ILIKE '%february 4%' OR date ILIKE '%feb 4%';
Result:
- cnt = 0
Interpretation: No entries use “february 4” or “feb 4”.

3) Do any rows use ordinal formatting like “February 4th”?
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE date ~* '[A-Za-z]+\s+\d+(st|nd|rd|th)';
Result:
- match_count = 0
Interpretation: No rows contain ordinal day formats such as “4th”.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows no game on February 4 (in any of the checked textual formats). Because there is no game on that date, the claim that “the game on february 4th have new jersey as the home team” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “February 4th” was interpreted as the date value in the table’s text-based date column, without a year.
- Checked for multiple textual variants: “february 4”, “feb 4”, and ordinal forms like “february 4th”, case-insensitive.
- Treated the TabFact database as the authoritative source per instructions.
