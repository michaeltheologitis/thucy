Claim assessed: “there be more than one classic rock station.”

Scope and data source
- I verified this claim against the only available authoritative dataset: TabFact (public schema), table media_in_kelowna, which lists radio stations in Kelowna with their formats.

Step 1: Inspect all stations
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM media_in_kelowna;
Result (frequency | call sign | branding | format | owner):
1) 1150 am | ckfr | am 1150 | news / talk | astral media
2) 00 88.9 fm | cbtk - fm | cbc radio one | public news / talk | canadian broadcasting corporation
3) 00 89.7 fm | cbu - fm - 3 | cbc radio 2 | public music | canadian broadcasting corporation
4) 00 90.5 fm | cbuf - fm - 2 | première chaîne | public news / talk | canadian broadcasting corporation
5) 00 96.3 fm | ckko - fm | k96.3 | classic rock | sun country cablevision
6) 00 99.9 fm | chsu - fm | 99.9 sun fm | contemporary hits radio | bell media
7) 0 101.5 fm | cilk - fm | 101.5 ez rock | adult contemporary | bell media
8) 0 103.1 fm | ckqq - fm | q103 | hot adult contemporary | jim pattison group
9) 0 103.9 fm | cjui - fm | 103.9 the juice | adult hits | vista broadcast group
10) 0 104.7 fm | cklz - fm | power 104 | active rock | jim pattison group

Step 2: Find stations with “classic rock” format
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%classic rock%';
Result:
- frequency: 00 96.3 fm | call sign: ckko - fm | branding: k96.3 | format: classic rock

Step 3: Count “classic rock” stations
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%classic rock%';
Result: 1

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one classic rock station in Kelowna (CKKO-FM, K96.3). Therefore, the claim that there is more than one classic rock station is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (media stations in Kelowna).
- Used the format field with a case-insensitive match for the exact phrase “classic rock”; related but different formats (e.g., “active rock,” “adult hits,” “classic hits”) were not counted as classic rock.
