Data source discovery and schema
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table used: public.fabio_fognini
  - Relevant columns: date (text), opponent in the final (text), outcome (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Broad check for 2012 entries to identify stored date format:
SQL:
SELECT date, "opponent in the final", outcome
FROM public.fabio_fognini
WHERE date ILIKE '%2012%';
Result included the row with date '29 april 2012'.

2) Exact lookup for April 29, 2012:
SQL:
SELECT date, "opponent in the final", outcome
FROM public.fabio_fognini
WHERE date = '29 april 2012';
Result:
- date = '29 april 2012'
- opponent in the final = 'gilles simon'
- outcome = 'runner - up'

Assessment
- The claim states: on April 29, 2012, the opponent was "giles simon" and the outcome was "runner - up".
- The database shows: on 29 April 2012, the opponent was "gilles simon" and the outcome was "runner - up".
- This matches the claim, with only a minor spelling variance ("giles" vs. "gilles"), which does not change the identity of the opponent.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "Game" refers to the final match entry in the fabio_fognini table.
- The subject of the claim is Fabio Fognini’s record (the only available dataset).
- "April 29, 2012" is equivalent to the stored text '29 april 2012'.
