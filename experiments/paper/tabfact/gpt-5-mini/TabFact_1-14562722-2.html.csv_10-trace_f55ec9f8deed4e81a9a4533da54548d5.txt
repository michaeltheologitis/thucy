Claim to verify: "on march 15 , 2007 and in region 2 the highest number of episode be 3"

Data discovery and schema
- Available source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5 connection), public schema.
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text)
  - No date column; region columns store textual dates of releases per region.

Initial data inspection
Executed SQL:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 1", "region 2", "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 50;
Result (5 rows):
1) volume: 1, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 1: "january 31 , 2006", region 2: "february 19 , 2007", region 4: "march 15 , 2007"
2) volume: 2, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 1: "march 28 , 2006", region 2: "june 4 , 2007", region 4: "july 5 , 2007"
3) volume: 3, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 1: "may 30 , 2006", region 2: "september 3 , 2007", region 4: "march 13 , 2008"
4) volume: 4, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 1: "july 18 , 2006", region 2: "february 18 , 2008", region 4: "june 19 , 2008"
5) volume: 5, discs: 1, episodes: 4, region 1: "september 19 , 2006", region 2: "may 26 , 2008", region 4: "march 5 , 2009"

Check 1: Is there any Region 2 release on “march 15 , 2007”?
Executed SQL (exact equality, case-insensitive, trimmed):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower(trim("region 2")) = lower(trim('march 15 , 2007'));
Result: match_count = 0

Executed SQL (regex for common variants):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS regex_match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower("region 2") ~ 'march\s*15\s*,?\s*2007';
Result: regex_match_count = 0

Check 2: Where does “march 15 , 2007” appear (if anywhere)?
Executed SQL:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes, 
       concat_ws(', ', 
         CASE WHEN lower("region 1") = lower('march 15 , 2007') THEN 'region 1' END,
         CASE WHEN lower("region 2") = lower('march 15 , 2007') THEN 'region 2' END,
         CASE WHEN lower("region 4") = lower('march 15 , 2007') THEN 'region 4' END
       ) AS matched_regions
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE lower("region 1") = lower('march 15 , 2007')
   OR lower("region 2") = lower('march 15 , 2007')
   OR lower("region 4") = lower('march 15 , 2007');
Result: volume = 1, discs = 1, episodes = 4, matched_regions = region 4
Interpretation: The date “march 15 , 2007” appears in Region 4, not Region 2.

Check 3: What is the highest number of episodes?
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(episodes) AS max_episodes FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: max_episodes = 4

Conclusions
- The date “march 15 , 2007” does not occur in Region 2; it occurs in Region 4 (volume 1).
- The highest number of episodes in the table is 4, not 3.
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data on both parts.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “on march 15 , 2007 and in region 2” as asserting that Region 2 has a release date of March 15, 2007.
- Interpreted “the highest number of episode be 3” as asserting that the maximum value of the ‘episodes’ column equals 3 across the dataset.
