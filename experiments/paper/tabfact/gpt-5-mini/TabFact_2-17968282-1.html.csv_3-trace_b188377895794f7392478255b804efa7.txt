Claim interpretation
I interpret the statement as two checks against the table public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n:
1) The row(s) whose "1991 - 92" value equals 36 have a "1993 - 94" value smaller than 34.
2) There exists a team named "estudiantes de la plata" in the table.

Evidence from the database
Data source discovery and schema context
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public, table: t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n
- Columns: team (text), average (double precision), points (bigint), played (bigint), "1991 - 92" (text), "1992 - 93" (text), "1993 - 94" (bigint)

1) Verify that the team(s) with "1991 - 92" = 36 have "1993 - 94" < 34
SQL (list matching rows):
SELECT team, "1991 - 92", "1993 - 94" FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE "1991 - 92" = '36' AND "1993 - 94" < 34;
Result:
- team: argentinos juniors, "1991 - 92": 36, "1993 - 94": 33

SQL (count matching rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE "1991 - 92" = '36' AND "1993 - 94" < 34;
Result:
- match_count: 1

This shows the sole row where "1991 - 92" equals 36 has a "1993 - 94" value of 33, which is smaller than 34.

2) Verify existence of a team named "estudiantes de la plata"
SQL:
SELECT team, average, points, played, "1991 - 92", "1992 - 93", "1993 - 94" FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE lower(team) = 'estudiantes de la plata';
Result:
- team: estudiantes de la plata, average: 0.93, points: 106, played: 114, "1991 - 92": 39, "1992 - 93": 29, "1993 - 94": 38

Conclusion
- Part 1: True. The row with "1991 - 92" = 36 (argentinos juniors) has "1993 - 94" = 33, which is smaller than 34.
- Part 2: True. There is a team named "estudiantes de la plata" in the table.
Overall, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted "36 of 1991 - 92 have a 1993 - 94 smaller than 34" to mean: the entry whose "1991 - 92" value equals 36 has a "1993 - 94" value less than 34 (rather than implying a count of 36 entries). The dataset only contains 20 rows, which supports this interpretation.
- Team name matching was done case-insensitively.
