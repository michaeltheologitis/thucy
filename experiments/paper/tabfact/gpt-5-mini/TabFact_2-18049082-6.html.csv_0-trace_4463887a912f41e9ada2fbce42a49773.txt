Claim interpreted: “Justin Rose is from the United States.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema). Identified relevant table: public.t_1998_open_championship with columns: place, player, country, score, to par.

Evidence from data:
- Query target: Locate Justin Rose in the 1998 Open Championship table and read the associated country.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1998_open_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Justin%' AND player ILIKE '%Rose%';
- Result:
  player: justin rose (a)
  country: england

Analysis:
- The table records Justin Rose’s country as “england,” not the United States. This directly contradicts the claim that he is from the United States.

Conclusion:
- Based on the authoritative table for the 1998 Open Championship, Justin Rose is associated with England. Therefore, the claim that he is from the United States is not supported by the data and is contradicted by it.

Assumptions:
- “Be from the United States” is interpreted as nationality (country) as represented by the “country” field in the event table.
- The 1998 Open Championship table is a reliable source for recording players’ countries in that event, reflecting their nationality at the time.
