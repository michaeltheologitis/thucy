Claim to verify: “huracán have a 40 in 1991 - 92 and a 43 in 1993 - 94.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (Postgres), schema: public.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n with columns: team, average, points, played, "1991 - 92", "1992 - 93", "1993 - 94".

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Huracán’s row and season values
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "1991 - 92", "1992 - 93", "1993 - 94" 
FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n
WHERE team ILIKE 'hurac%';

Result:
- team: huracán
- 1991 - 92: 40
- 1992 - 93: 38
- 1993 - 94: 43

Assessment:
- The table shows Huracán has 40 for 1991 - 92 and 43 for 1993 - 94. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “huracán” refers to the team entry labeled exactly as “huracán” in the table.
- “have a 40/43” refers to the values in the season columns “1991 - 92” and “1993 - 94” for that team.
