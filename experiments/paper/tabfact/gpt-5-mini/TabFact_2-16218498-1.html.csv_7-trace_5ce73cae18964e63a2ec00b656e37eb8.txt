Claim to verify: "a total of 2 game and 2 leg that have the score of 0 - 0"

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs with columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Operational interpretation
- "game" interpreted as a two-legged tie (aggregate), represented by the "agg" column.
- "leg" interpreted as an individual match instance in the tie, represented by "1st leg" or "2nd leg" columns.
- Normalization of 0-0: treat any value that begins with 0 and 0 separated by a dash-like separator (allowing spaces and common dash variants; ignoring trailing annotations such as penalties) as a 0-0 score.

Evidence and results
1) Count of ties (games) with aggregate 0-0
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS agg_0_0_count
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "agg" ~ '^\s*0\s*[-–—‑]\s*0';
- Result: {"agg_0_0_count": 1}

2) Count of individual legs with score 0-0
- SQL executed (1st leg):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS first_leg_0_0_count
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "1st leg" ~ '^\s*0\s*[-–—‑]\s*0';
- Result: {"first_leg_0_0_count": 2}

- SQL executed (2nd leg):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS second_leg_0_0_count
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "2nd leg" ~ '^\s*0\s*[-–—‑]\s*0';
- Result: {"second_leg_0_0_count": 1}

- Total 0-0 legs: 3

3) Rows illustrating the matches that matched (for transparency)
- SQL executed (agg 0-0 rows):
  SELECT "team 1","team 2","agg","1st leg","2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "agg" ~ '0[[:space:]]*[-–—:][[:space:]]*0';
- Row returned:
  - port autonome | sporting clube da praia | 0 - 0 (1 - 3) | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0

- SQL executed (1st leg 0-0 rows):
  SELECT "team 1","team 2","agg","1st leg","2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "1st leg" ~ '0[[:space:]]*[-–—:][[:space:]]*0';
- Rows returned:
  - port autonome | sporting clube da praia | 0 - 0 (1 - 3) | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0
  - tourbillon fc | forces armées ca | 1 - 1 | 0 - 0 | 1 - 1

- SQL executed (2nd leg 0-0 rows):
  SELECT "team 1","team 2","agg","1st leg","2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "2nd leg" ~ '0[[:space:]]*[-–—:][[:space:]]*0';
- Row returned:
  - port autonome | sporting clube da praia | 0 - 0 (1 - 3) | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows 1 tie (game) with an aggregate starting 0-0 and 3 individual legs that are 0-0. The claim of "2 game and 2 leg" with 0-0 is not supported.

Assumptions noted
- "game" = two-legged tie aggregate (column "agg").
- "leg" = individual match leg (columns "1st leg" and "2nd leg").
- Scores normalized to match leading 0-0 regardless of dash variants and ignoring trailing annotations such as penalty shootout notes.
- If “exactly '0 - 0' with no trailing text” were required, the aggregate count would be 0 rather than 1; this would make the claim even less supported.
