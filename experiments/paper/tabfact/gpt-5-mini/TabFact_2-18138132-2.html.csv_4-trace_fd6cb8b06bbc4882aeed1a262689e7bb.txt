Claim to verify:
“2010-11-17 be the release date with a category of Utilities, a developer of Dino Game, and a title of Chord Finder.”

Data source explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact27 (public schema)
- Table: public.list_of_zune_applications (columns: title, developer, category, "release date", version)

Step 1: Locate the app by title “Chord Finder”.
Result:
- title: chord finder
- developer: microsoft
- category: utilities
- release date: 2010 - 11 - 17
- version: 1.0

Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE lower(title) = 'chord finder';

Step 2: Check whether any app has developer exactly “dino game”, or developers containing “dino”.
Results:
- Exact developer = “dino game”: 0 apps
- Developers containing “dino” (for context):
  • title: drum machine hd | developer: dino games | category: utilities | release date: 2010 - 10 - 20
  • title: metronome | developer: dino games | category: utilities | release date: 2010 - 09 - 09

Executed SQL (substring and exact checks):
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date"
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE lower(developer) = 'dino game' OR lower(developer) LIKE '%dino%';

SELECT count(*) AS exact_match_count
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE lower(developer) = 'dino game';

Assessment of each element in the claim:
- Title = “Chord Finder”: Supported (found exactly, case-insensitive).
- Release date = “2010-11-17”: Supported (stored as “2010 - 11 - 17”).
- Category = “Utilities”: Supported.
- Developer = “Dino Game”: Not supported (data shows developer is “microsoft”; no exact “dino game” developer exists in the table).

Conclusion: The app “Chord Finder” exists with the stated title, category, and release date, but the developer is not “Dino Game”; it is “microsoft” in the data.

Assumptions:
- Title matching was done case-insensitively using lower(title) = 'chord finder'.
- “Dino Game” was interpreted as an exact developer name; we also checked for any developer containing “dino” for completeness.
