- Claim: “the production code for the episode that have 23.9 million us viewer be 467661.”
- Finding: The episode with 23.9 million US viewers in the available dataset has production code 467659, not 467661.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: TabFact PostgreSQL instance with a public schema containing a table: friends_season_5.

Schema inspection
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'friends_season_5';

Result (abridged):
- Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint), "us viewers (millions)" (double precision)

Evidence query 1: Exact match on 23.9 million
Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in series", "no in season", "production code", "us viewers (millions)" 
FROM friends_season_5
WHERE "us viewers (millions)" = 23.9;

Result:
- title: the one with all the thanksgivings
- no in series: 105
- no in season: 8
- production code: 467659
- us viewers (millions): 23.9

Evidence query 2: Range check around 23.9
Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "production code", "us viewers (millions)" 
FROM friends_season_5 
WHERE "us viewers (millions)" BETWEEN 23.85 AND 23.95;

Result:
- title: the one with all the thanksgivings; no in season: 8; production code: 467659; us viewers (millions): 23.9
