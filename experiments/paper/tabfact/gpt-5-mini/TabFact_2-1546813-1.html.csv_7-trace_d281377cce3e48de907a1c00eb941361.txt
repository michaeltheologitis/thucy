Claim to verify: “Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth were all captains who won the Solheim Cup 1 time.”

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact26, schema public, table: solheim_cup

Schema of public.solheim_cup
- Columns: year (bigint), venue (text), winning team (text), score (text), usa captain (text), europe captain (text)

Evidence
1) Distinct values for winning team
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "winning team" FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY "winning team";
- Result:
  europe
  united states

2) Distinct USA captains listed in the data
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "usa captain" FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY "usa captain" ASC;
- Result includes: beth daniel; betsy king; joanne carner; judy rankin; kathy whitworth; meg mallon; nancy lopez; pat bradley; patty sheehan; rosie jones
- This confirms all three individuals appear as USA captains in the dataset.

3) All Solheim Cup rows for the three named captains (to see outcomes by year)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, "winning team", "usa captain" 
  FROM public.solheim_cup
  WHERE LOWER("usa captain") IN ('judy rankin','patty sheehan','kathy whitworth')
  ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result:
  1990 | united states | kathy whitworth
  1992 | europe        | kathy whitworth
  1996 | united states | judy rankin
  1998 | united states | judy rankin
  2002 | united states | patty sheehan
  2003 | europe        | patty sheehan

4) Appearances and wins as USA captain for each person
- Kathy Whitworth
  - SQL (appearances):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS appearances FROM solheim_cup WHERE LOWER("usa captain") = 'kathy whitworth';
    Result: appearances = 2
  - SQL (wins):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM solheim_cup WHERE LOWER("usa captain") = 'kathy whitworth' AND LOWER("winning team") = 'united states';
    Result: wins = 1
- Judy Rankin
  - SQL (appearances):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS appearances FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE lower("usa captain") = 'judy rankin';
    Result: appearances = 2
  - SQL (wins):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE lower("usa captain") = 'judy rankin' AND lower("winning team") = 'united states';
    Result: wins = 2
- Patty Sheehan
  - SQL (appearances):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS appearances FROM solheim_cup WHERE lower("usa captain") = 'patty sheehan';
    Result: appearances = 2
  - SQL (wins):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM solheim_cup WHERE lower("usa captain") = 'patty sheehan' AND lower("winning team") = 'united states';
    Result: wins = 1

Findings
- All three served as USA captains (verified).
- Wins as captain:
  - Kathy Whitworth: 1 win (1990)
  - Judy Rankin: 2 wins (1996, 1998)
  - Patty Sheehan: 1 win (2002)
- Therefore, it is incorrect that all three “won the Solheim Cup 1 time” as captain; Judy Rankin won twice.

Conclusion
- The claim is partly inaccurate: two of the three captains (Sheehan and Whitworth) won once, but Rankin won twice.

Assumptions about the claim’s intent
- Interpreted “be all captain that win the solheim cup 1 time” to mean: each of the three individuals served as captain and each won exactly once as captain.
- Matching performed case-insensitively on names and winning team values as stored in the dataset.
