Claim: 8 games have an attendance of over 70,000 during the 1993 New York Jets season.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
  Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "game site" (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence gathered:
1) Count of games with attendance strictly greater than 70,000
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000;
- Result: count = 7

2) Details of games with attendance strictly greater than 70,000
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", result, attendance FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000 ORDER BY week;
- Result rows:
  - Week 2  | 1993-09-12 | miami dolphins       | joe robbie stadium | w 24-14 | 70314
  - Week 5  | 1993-10-03 | philadelphia eagles  | the meadowlands    | l 35-30 | 72593
  - Week 8  | 1993-10-24 | buffalo bills        | the meadowlands    | l 19-10 | 71541
  - Week 9  | 1993-10-31 | new york giants      | giants stadium     | w 10-6  | 71659
  - Week 10 | 1993-11-07 | miami dolphins       | the meadowlands    | w 27-10 | 71306
  - Week 16 | 1993-12-18 | dallas cowboys       | the meadowlands    | l 28-7  | 73233
  - Week 17 | 1993-12-26 | buffalo bills        | rich stadium       | l 16-14 | 70817

3) Context checks
- Total games in season table
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
  Result: total_games = 16

- Sensitivity check (attendance >= 70,000)
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_ge_70000 FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance >= 70000;
  Result: games_ge_70000 = 7

Conclusion:
- The data show 7 games with attendance over 70,000, not 8. Even when interpreting “over 70,000” as “at least 70,000,” the count remains 7. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “over 70,000” as strictly greater than 70,000; a secondary check using ≥70,000 produced the same count.
- Each row in t_1993_new_york_jets_season represents one game in the 1993 season.
