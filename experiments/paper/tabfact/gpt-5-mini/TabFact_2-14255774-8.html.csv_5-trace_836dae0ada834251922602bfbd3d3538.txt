Summary
- I examined the available database (TabFact, postgres_tabfact2). The only relevant table is public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season, which contains per-game rows with an attendance field.
- Using this table, I computed the average attendance across all rows it contains.

What the data shows
- The table has 26 games. The overall average attendance across these games is approximately 35,752, not 31,521.

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Inspect sample rows
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 10;
Result (abbrev.):
- { date: "september 1", opponent: "cardinals", attendance: 35075 }
- { date: "september 2", opponent: "cardinals", attendance: 27568 }
- { date: "september 3", opponent: "cardinals", attendance: 24350 }
- { date: "september 5", opponent: "dodgers", attendance: 52270 }
- { date: "september 6", opponent: "dodgers", attendance: 47543 }
- { date: "september 7", opponent: "dodgers", attendance: 54137 }
- { date: "september 8", opponent: "giants", attendance: 30252 }
- { date: "september 9", opponent: "giants", attendance: 30518 }
- { date: "september 10", opponent: "giants", attendance: 30992 }
- { date: "september 12", opponent: "reds", attendance: 29046 }

2) Average attendance (rounded and exact)
SQL:
SELECT ROUND(AVG(attendance)) AS avg_attendance_rounded, AVG(attendance) AS avg_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- avg_attendance_rounded = 35752
- avg_attendance = 35751.769230769231

3) Row count (number of games)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- total_games = 26

4) Min/Max attendance (context)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- min_attendance = 22616

SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- max_attendance = 54137

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative data, the average attendance per game in this table is about 35,752. This contradicts the claim that it was 31,521.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The only accessible dataset for the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season contains 26 games (appearing to be a subset of the season). I treated this as the authoritative data available for verification. If the claim refers to the full 162-game season or specifically to home games only, that detail is not encoded in this dataset and cannot be distinguished here. The verdict is therefore based strictly on the available table’s contents.
