Claim to verify: “Daniel Uberti was sacked by Nejapa on Dec 29, 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance (postgres_tabfact20) with a public schema.
- Identified a relevant table: public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 containing managerial changes for the Apertura 2008 season, with fields for team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replacements, and appointments.

Evidence retrieved
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, "outgoing manager", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "replaced by", "date of appointment", "position in table" FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE team ILIKE '%Nejapa%';

- Result rows:
  1) team: nejapa; outgoing manager: mauricio cienfuegos; manner of departure: mutual consent; date of vacancy: 14 august 2008; replaced by: daniel uberti; date of appointment: 5 september 2008; position in table: 10th.
  2) team: nejapa; outgoing manager: daniel uberti; manner of departure: sacked; date of vacancy: 29 december 2008; replaced by: nelson ancheta; date of appointment: 29 december 2008; position in table: post - season (10th).

Assessment
- The table explicitly records that for team “Nejapa,” outgoing manager “daniel uberti” had “manner of departure: sacked” with “date of vacancy: 29 december 2008,” and was replaced the same day by Nelson Ancheta.
- This directly supports the claim that Daniel Uberti was sacked by Nejapa on December 29, 2008.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported in full by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to Nejapa FC (El Salvador) and the managerial change date corresponds to the recorded “date of vacancy” in the Apertura 2008 table.
