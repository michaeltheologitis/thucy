Claim interpreted: “The match with the shortest time was a win against Borislav Jeliazkov.” I verify this using the available fight record data for Tim Lajcik.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact7)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.tim_lajcik (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)

Evidence 1: All fights sorted by converted time (ascending)
Executed SQL:
SELECT res AS result, opponent, method, event, round, time AS raw_time,
CASE WHEN time ~ '^\d{1,2}:[0-5][0-9]$' THEN
  ((regexp_match(time, '^(\d{1,2}):([0-5][0-9])$'))[1])::int * 60
  + ((regexp_match(time, '^(\d{1,2}):([0-5][0-9])$'))[2])::int
ELSE NULL END AS time_seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
ORDER BY time_seconds ASC NULLS LAST, raw_time;
Key rows (shortest first):
- 0:18 — result: win, opponent: joe campanella (time_seconds: 18)
- 1:20 — result: win, opponent: paul devich (time_seconds: 80)
- 1:34 — result: loss, opponent: marcelo tigre (time_seconds: 94)
- 1:55 — result: loss, opponent: kimo leopoldo (time_seconds: 115)
- 2:23 — result: loss, opponent: borislav jeliazkov (time_seconds: 143)
… (longer times follow)

Evidence 2: Shortest win only
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time AS raw_time,
       (split_part(time, ':', 1)::int*60 + split_part(time, ':', 2)::int) AS total_seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE res = 'win' AND time ~ '^[0-9]+:[0-9]{2}$'
ORDER BY total_seconds ASC;
Result (shortest win):
- res: win | opponent: joe campanella | raw_time: 0:18 | total_seconds: 18

Evidence 3: Fights vs. Borislav Jeliazkov
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE opponent ILIKE 'borislav jeliazkov';
Result:
- res: loss | opponent: borislav jeliazkov | method: submission (rear naked choke) | event: rings : king of kings 1999 block b | round: 1 | time: 2:23

Findings
- The shortest recorded fight time is 0:18 (a win vs. Joe Campanella), not against Borislav Jeliazkov.
- The fight vs. Borislav Jeliazkov was a loss at 2:23, which is not the shortest time.

Conclusion
- The claim that the shortest-time match was a win against Borislav Jeliazkov is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to the fights listed in public.tim_lajcik.
- “Shortest time” is interpreted using the time column parsed as M:SS.
- “Be win against” is interpreted as “was a win against.”
