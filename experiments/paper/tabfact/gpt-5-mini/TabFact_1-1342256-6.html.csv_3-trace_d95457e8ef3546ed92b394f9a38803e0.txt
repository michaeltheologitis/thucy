Claim to verify: "alfred j elliott be re - elect to california's 10th district in 1937"

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a single accessible database: TabFact (public schema), containing one table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942.

Evidence collected from the data:
1) Locate California’s 10th district entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE district ILIKE '%california%' AND district ILIKE '%10%';
Result:
- district: california 10
- incumbent: alfred j elliott
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1937
- result: re - elected
- candidates: alfred j elliott (d) unopposed

2) Cross-check by searching for Alfred J. Elliott by name
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%alfred%' OR incumbent ILIKE '%elliott%' OR candidates ILIKE '%alfred%' OR candidates ILIKE '%elliott%';
Result (same row):
- district: california 10
- incumbent: alfred j elliott
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1937
- result: re - elected
- candidates: alfred j elliott (d) unopposed

Assessment:
- The table records that Alfred J. Elliott was the incumbent for California’s 10th district and was “re - elected” in the 1942 election, with “first elected: 1937.”
- Therefore, according to the data, 1937 is the year he was first elected, not re-elected. The claim that he was re-elected in 1937 is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the “first elected: 1937” field.

Conclusion: The person and district are correct, but the timing/action is not. The claim’s core assertion (re-elected in 1937) is incorrect based on the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “California’s 10th district” refers to the U.S. House of Representatives district, consistent with the table’s scope.
- “First elected: 1937” indicates the initial election year to that seat, and “result: re - elected” in this table refers to the 1942 election outcome recorded in the same row.
