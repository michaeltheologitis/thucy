Interpretation of the claim: The statement implies that there exists a match at the MCG (Melbourne Cricket Ground) where the away team scored exactly 15.17 (107).

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1981_vfl_season (columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date)

Evidence gathered:
1) Searched for any match where the away team scored exactly 15.17 (107):
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "date", "crowd"
FROM public.t_1981_vfl_season
WHERE "away team score" = '15.17 (107)';

Result:
- Home team: south melbourne; Away team: north melbourne; Away team score: 15.17 (107); Venue: lake oval; Date: 29 august 1981; Crowd: 8484

2) Listed all matches at the MCG in this dataset and their away team scores:
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM t_1981_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%MCG%' ORDER BY date;

Supplementary check for venue naming:
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM t_1981_vfl_season ORDER BY venue;

Result for MCG matches:
- 29 august 1981 — Home: richmond; Away: carlton; Away team score: 9.13 (67)

Conclusion:
- Within the 1981 VFL season data available, the only away team score of 15.17 (107) occurred at Lake Oval, not at the MCG. The match played at the MCG in this dataset has an away score of 9.13 (67).

Assumptions:
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the accessible dataset (1981 VFL season only).
- Venue names are taken as recorded in the table; matching to MCG used case-insensitive search on 'MCG'.
- The score format requires an exact string match '15.17 (107)'.
