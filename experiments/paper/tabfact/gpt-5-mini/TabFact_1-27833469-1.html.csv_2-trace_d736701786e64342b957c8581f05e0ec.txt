Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that “All About Christmas Eve” is the title for the 11th episode of a season (the phrasing says “season 11,” but available data suggests this refers to episode 11 within a season). We verify against the available data source (a Will & Grace Season 5 episode table).

Evidence gathered
1) Locate any episodes titled “All About Christmas Eve”:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, season, series FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE title ILIKE '%All About Christmas Eve%';
- Result:
  • title: all about christmas eve
  • season: 11
  • series: 102

Interpretation: In this table, the column named “season” holds the in-season episode number (not the show’s season number). The table itself is will_grace_season_5, so all rows are from Season 5; “season = 11” indicates episode 11 of Season 5.

2) Confirm that the “season” column represents the episode’s position within Season 5:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, season
  FROM public.will_grace_season_5
  ORDER BY NULLIF(regexp_replace(season, '\\D', '', 'g'), '')::integer ASC
  LIMIT 15;
- Partial Result (ordered numerically):
  1) season = 1  — title = and the horse he rode in on
  2) season = 2  — title = bacon and eggs
  ...
  9) season = 11 — title = all about christmas eve
  10) season = 12 — title = field of queens
  ...

Conclusion
- The data shows that “All About Christmas Eve” is the title of episode 11 in Will & Grace Season 5. Therefore, if the claim intends “episode 11 within the season,” it is supported by the data.
- If the claim intended “Season 11” of a series, the available data does not support that interpretation (and in this dataset, the table is specifically Season 5 of Will & Grace).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “season 11” as “episode 11 within the season,” based on the table structure (will_grace_season_5) and the column behavior showing sequential episode numbers in the “season” field.
- Scope limited to the available data source (Will & Grace Season 5 episodes).
