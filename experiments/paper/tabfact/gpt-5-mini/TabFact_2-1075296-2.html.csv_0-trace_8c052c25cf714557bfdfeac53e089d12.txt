Claim to verify:
“michael schumacher be the driver whose constructor be ferrari have an average grid number of 1 with time / retire of 1:32:35.101.”

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact6 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2004_european_grand_prix (columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Michael Schumacher’s entry for Ferrari with grid and time/retired values
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor, grid, "time / retired" FROM t_2004_european_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'michael schumacher' AND constructor = 'ferrari';
Result:
- driver: michael schumacher
- constructor: ferrari
- grid: 1
- time / retired: 1:32:35.101

2) Compute the average grid for Michael Schumacher with constructor Ferrari in this table
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG(grid) AS avg_grid FROM t_2004_european_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'michael schumacher' AND constructor = 'ferrari';
Result:
- avg_grid: 1.00000000000000000000

Assessment:
- The row for Michael Schumacher driving for Ferrari in t_2004_european_grand_prix shows a grid position of 1 and a time/retired value of 1:32:35.101.
- The average grid for Michael Schumacher with Ferrari in this table is 1.0 (only one matching row, so the average equals the grid).

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are supported by the data in the referenced table.

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the 2004 European Grand Prix as represented by the table t_2004_european_grand_prix in the TabFact database.
- Driver and constructor names are matched exactly as stored (lowercase in this table).
