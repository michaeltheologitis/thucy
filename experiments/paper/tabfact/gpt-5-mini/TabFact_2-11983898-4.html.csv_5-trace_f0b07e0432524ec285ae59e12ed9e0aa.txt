Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the database schema.
- Queried for any entries related to “Stuttgart” to verify the Stuttgart Open final details (tournament, surface, date, opponent, score).
- Queried for any occurrences of the exact final score “4 - 6 , 3 - 6” to see where it occurred.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29), public schema
- Tables: fabio_fognini (columns: outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, score in the final)

Evidence 1: Stuttgart-related entry
- Purpose: Verify what the database lists for Stuttgart Open (location, surface, opponent, and final score).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament, surface, date, outcome, "opponent in the final", "score in the final" 
FROM public.fabio_fognini
WHERE tournament ILIKE '%stuttgart%';
- Result (1 row):
  - tournament: stuttgart open , stuttgart , germany
  - surface: clay
  - date: 14 july 2013
  - outcome: winner
  - opponent in the final: philipp kohlschreiber
  - score in the final: 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4
- Interpretation: The Stuttgart Open record is on clay and the final score is 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 (not 4 - 6 , 3 - 6).

Evidence 2: Exact score “4 - 6 , 3 - 6” anywhere
- Purpose: Determine if/where the exact score “4 - 6 , 3 - 6” appears.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament, surface, date, outcome, "opponent in the final", "score in the final" FROM public.fabio_fognini WHERE "score in the final" = '4 - 6 , 3 - 6';
- Result (1 row):
  - tournament: brd năstase ţiriac trophy , bucharest , romania
  - surface: clay
  - date: 29 april 2012
  - outcome: runner - up
  - opponent in the final: gilles simon
  - score in the final: 4 - 6 , 3 - 6
- Interpretation: The exact score “4 - 6 , 3 - 6” exists in the data, but it corresponds to Bucharest 2012, not the Stuttgart Open.

Conclusion
- The data shows that at the Stuttgart Open (Stuttgart, Germany) on clay, the final score listed is 5 - 7 , 6 - 4 , 6 - 4 against Philipp Kohlschreiber on 14 July 2013. The claimed score “4 - 6 , 3 - 6” did not occur at the Stuttgart Open in this dataset; it occurred at the BRD Năstase Ţiriac Trophy (Bucharest) in 2012.

Assumptions made
- “Stuttgart Open, Stuttgart, Germany” refers to the tournament entry exactly as recorded in the dataset: “stuttgart open , stuttgart , germany”.
- The claim concerns the final score of that event as captured in the fabio_fognini table.
- String comparisons for the score used exact formatting when searching for “4 - 6 , 3 - 6”.
