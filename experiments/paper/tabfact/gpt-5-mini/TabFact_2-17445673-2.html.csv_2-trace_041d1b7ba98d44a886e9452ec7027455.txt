Claim interpreted: “only 2 match be play through 3 round” = Only two of Tim Lajcik’s recorded matches went to (i.e., reached/completed) round 3.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (schema: public).
- Relevant table (via schema inspection): public.tim_lajcik with columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text).

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Count of matches with round = 3
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_round_3 FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE round = 3;
- Result: 2

2) List of those round = 3 matches (opponent and event)
- SQL: SELECT opponent, event FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE round = 3;
- Results:
  • opponent: osami shibuya | event: pancrase - 2001 neo - blood tournament second round
  • opponent: ron waterman  | event: ufc 22

3) Methods/results for round = 3 matches (to confirm they indeed went through round 3)
- SQL: SELECT opponent, event, method, res, time FROM tim_lajcik WHERE round = 3;
- Results:
  • osami shibuya | method: decision (unanimous) | res: win | time: 5:00
  • ron waterman  | method: draw                  | res: draw | time: 5:00
  (Both outcomes indicate the fights reached the end of round 3.)

4) Total matches in the table (context)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.tim_lajcik;
- Result: 14 total matches.

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 2 matches with round = 3, and both have outcomes consistent with completing three full rounds (decision or draw). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to rows in public.tim_lajcik.
- “Play through 3 round” is interpreted as fights that reached/completed the third round (round = 3 in the data, with methods indicating decision/draw rather than stoppage before the end of round 3).
