Summary conclusion: Inaccurate. In the available data, there is a screening that completed on 30 june 2006, but there is no screening that completed on 4 october 2006. Moreover, the screening that completed on 30 june 2006 actually started on 18 may 2006, which is months before October 2006—not 5 months after it.

Data source discovery
- One accessible PostgreSQL database was found (postgres_tabfact11), schema public.

Schema inspection
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns include: "screening started" (text), "screening completed" (text), plus other columns.

Evidence from the data (with exact SQL)
1) Overview of screening start and completion values
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed" FROM public.my_info_table;
Key returned rows (start → completed) include:
- 18 may 2006 → 30 june 2006
- 11 september 2006 → 10 october 2006
- 7 september 2006 → 13 october 2006
(And other rows; none show a completion on 4 october 2006.)

2) Locate the screening that completed on 30 june 2006
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" = '30 june 2006';
Result:
- screening started: 18 may 2006
- screening completed: 30 june 2006

3) Check for any screening that completed on 4 october 2006
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" = '4 october 2006';
Result: No matching rows found.

4) List all completions in October 2006 (to confirm absence of 4 October)
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower(trim("screening completed")) LIKE '%october 2006';
Results:
- 11 september 2006 — 10 october 2006
- 7 september 2006 — 13 october 2006
No 4 october 2006 entry exists.

5) Quantify the temporal relationship claimed (for clarity)
- Actual start for the 30 june 2006 completion: 18 may 2006. Difference to 4 october 2006:
SQL executed:
SELECT
  to_date(upper("screening started"), 'DD MON YYYY') AS start_date,
  date '2006-10-04' AS target_date,
  (date '2006-10-04' - to_date(upper("screening started"), 'DD MON YYYY')) AS days_difference,
  round(((date '2006-10-04' - to_date(upper("screening started"), 'DD MON YYYY'))::double precision / 30.4375)::numeric, 2) AS approx_months
FROM my_info_table
WHERE lower("screening completed") = '30 june 2006';
Result:
- start_date: 2006-05-18
- target_date: 2006-10-04
- days_difference: 139 days
- approx_months: 4.57 months (start date is before 4 October 2006)

- What would “5 months after 4 October 2006” be?
SQL executed:
SELECT (DATE '2006-10-04' + INTERVAL '5 months')::DATE AS result;
Result: 2007-03-04
This is long after the actual completion (30 june 2006) and far later than the actual start (18 may 2006), contradicting the claim.

Conclusion
- The data shows:
  - A screening completed on 30 june 2006 started on 18 may 2006.
  - No screening completed on 4 october 2006 exists in the dataset.
  - Therefore, the claim that “the screening complete on 30 june 2006 be start 5 month after the screening that be complete on 4 october 2006” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions about the claim’s intent
- Interpreted the statement as: “The screening that completed on 30 June 2006 started 5 months after the screening that completed on 4 October 2006.”
- Used exact text matching for dates as stored in the dataset (lowercased where noted). If the claim intended different dates or a different dataset, that would change the evaluation.
