Summary verdict: The claim is inaccurate. In the available data, the only game with a score of 3 - 2 took place in Chongqing, China—not “Chongqing, England.” The venue is not “London, China,” and no such venue appears in the data.

What I checked and found
- Data source discovery: Found a single PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact24 / TabFact) with one table in the public schema: public.kwak_tae_hwi (date, venue, score, result, competition).
- Target score search: Queried for any match with a 3–2-type score. Found exactly one row, with venue “chongqing , china.”
- Venue validation: Verified that no rows exist with venues “london , china” or “chongqing , england.”

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Locate rows where the score indicates 3–2
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi
WHERE score ~ '3\s*[-–—−]\s*2';
Result:
- date: february 17 , 2008
- venue: chongqing , china
- score: 3 - 2
- result: 3 - 2
- competition: 2008 east asian cup

2) Count rows with score 3–2 pattern
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS matching_rows
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi
WHERE score ~ '3\s*[-–—−]\s*2';
Result:
- matching_rows: 1

3) Check if any row has venue equal to 'london , china' or 'chongqing , england'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue IN ('london , china','chongqing , england');
Result:
- total_matches: 0

SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN venue='london , china' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS london_china_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN venue='chongqing , england' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS chongqing_england_count
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi;
Result:
- london_china_count: 0
- chongqing_england_count: 0

4) List all rows with venue = 'chongqing , china'
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue = 'chongqing , china';
Result:
- date: february 17 , 2008
- venue: chongqing , china
- score: 3 - 2
- result: 3 - 2
- competition: 2008 east asian cup

Conclusion
- The only 3–2 match in the data took place in Chongqing, China.
- No matches list “Chongqing, England.”
- No matches list the venue as “London, China.”
Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “the game with a score of 3 - 2” as referring to matches recorded in the available table (public.kwak_tae_hwi) and used flexible dash matching (e.g., '3 - 2', '3–2').
