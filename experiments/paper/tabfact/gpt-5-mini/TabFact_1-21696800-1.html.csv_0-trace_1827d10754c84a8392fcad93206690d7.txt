Summary
- I explored the available database and found a table with episode-level data for Smallville Season 9, including a column for US viewership (in millions). The second episode in that season is recorded with 2.24 million U.S. viewers. Based on the available data, the claim is supported when interpreted as referring to Smallville Season 9’s second episode.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact22), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.smallville_season_9 with a numeric column "us viewers (million)".

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Confirm table columns
SQL:
SELECT column_name, ordinal_position, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='smallville_season_9'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Result (abbrev.): columns include "no" (bigint), "-" (bigint), "title" (text), "us air date" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision).

2) Inspect overall numbering in column "no"
SQL:
SELECT "no" FROM public.smallville_season_9 ORDER BY "no";
Result (abbrev.): 175, 176, ..., 194 (indicates overall episode numbers, not within-season order).

3) Inspect season-local numbering in column "-"
SQL:
SELECT "-" FROM public.smallville_season_9 ORDER BY "-";
Result: 1, 2, 3, ..., 20 (confirms this is the season episode index).

4) Retrieve the second episode’s title, air date, and US viewership
SQL:
SELECT "-" AS season_episode_number, "title", "us air date", "us viewers (million)"
FROM public.smallville_season_9
WHERE "-" = 2;
Result:
[{"season_episode_number":2, "title":"metallo", "us air date":"october 2 , 2009", "us viewers (million)":2.24}]

Conclusion
- The second episode (season episode number 2) of Smallville Season 9 had 2.24 million U.S. viewers, matching the claim when interpreted for this dataset.

Assumptions
- Because only Smallville Season 9 data was available, I interpreted “the second episode” to refer to the second episode of Smallville Season 9. If you intended a different show/season, please specify, and I will verify against the relevant data (if available).
