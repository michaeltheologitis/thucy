Interpretation: You’re asking which state corresponds to entries where the 'from' field is 830 bc.

Data source discovery:
- Found a PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact12
- Table used: public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc (columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, from)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Exact match for '830 BC' (title case) returned no rows:
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT state
FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc
WHERE "from" = '830 BC';
Result: no rows

2) Case-insensitive search for any 'from' containing '830' returned one row:
Executed SQL:
SELECT state, "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE "from" ILIKE '%830%';
Result:
- state: song, from: 830 bc

Conclusion: The state is "song" for the entry where the from field is 830 bc.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the question as: “Which state has 'from' equal to or recorded as 830 bc?”
- Performed a case-insensitive search since the stored value is lowercase ('830 bc') rather than '830 BC'.
