Claim to verify: “Stuart Potts was the man of the match during the league / cup competition on the 22nd.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact19 (TabFact) on PostgreSQL.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season with columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (text), competition (text), "man of the match" (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Sample rows to understand date format and presence of relevant fields
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, "man of the match" FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season LIMIT 10;
Key returned rows (excerpt):
- Row 8: date='22nd', opponent='wightlink raiders', venue='away', result='lost 5 - 4', attendance='509', competition='league / cup', man of the match='stuart potts'.
Observation: The date column uses day-of-month strings with ordinal suffixes (e.g., '22nd').

2) Direct check for matches on date = '22nd'
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, "man of the match" FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE date = '22nd';
Result:
- opponent: wightlink raiders; venue: away; result: lost 5 - 4; attendance: 509; competition: league / cup; man of the match: stuart potts.

3) Frequency of “Stuart Potts” as man of the match and associated date/competition
SQL executed:
- Listing rows:
SELECT date, competition FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE lower("man of the match") = 'stuart potts' ORDER BY date;
Result: [{"date":"22nd","competition":"league / cup"}]
- Counting rows:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE lower("man of the match") = 'stuart potts';
Result: [{"cnt":1}]

Assessment
- The table shows a single match with date = '22nd' and competition = 'league / cup' where the man of the match is 'stuart potts'. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “On the 22nd” is interpreted as the day-of-month value '22nd' used in the table’s date column (the table does not include month/year).
- Case-insensitive matching is used for the player name.
- The TabFact/postgres_tabfact19 dataset is treated as authoritative within the available scope.
