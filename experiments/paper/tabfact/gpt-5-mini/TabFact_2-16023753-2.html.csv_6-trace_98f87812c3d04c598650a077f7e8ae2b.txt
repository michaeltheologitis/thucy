Claim to verify: "the dolphins' final 10 game be victory"

How I interpreted the claim
- Interpreted as: For the season represented in the available dataset, the Miami Dolphins won their final 10 regular-season games.

Data source discovery
- Available source: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact), schema public
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Evidence from data
1) Full season games ordered by week
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
  FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  ORDER BY week;
- Key rows (Weeks 7–16 are the final 10 games):
  Week 7: result = w 32 - 14
  Week 8: result = w 21 - 7
  Week 9: result = w 30 - 14
  Week 10: result = w 20 - 17
  Week 11: result = l 17 - 6
  Week 12: result = w 37 - 0
  Week 13: result = w 38 - 14
  Week 14: result = w 24 - 17
  Week 15: result = w 31 - 24
  Week 16: result = w 34 - 14

2) Final 10 games with win flag and total wins
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
         CASE WHEN result ILIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END AS win_flag
  FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  ORDER BY week DESC
  LIMIT 10;
- Results (weeks 16 down to 7): win_flag values = 1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,1

- Executed SQL (aggregate):
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN result ILIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS total_wins
  FROM (
    SELECT result
    FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
    ORDER BY week DESC
    LIMIT 10
  ) sub;
- Result: total_wins = 9

Conclusion
- The 1983 Miami Dolphins did not win their final 10 regular-season games; they won 9 of the last 10, with a loss in Week 11.

Assumptions
- I assumed the claim refers to the Miami Dolphins team and to the 1983 season (the only available dataset), interpreting "final 10 game" as the final 10 regular-season games. I treated results beginning with 'w' as wins and 'l' as losses.
