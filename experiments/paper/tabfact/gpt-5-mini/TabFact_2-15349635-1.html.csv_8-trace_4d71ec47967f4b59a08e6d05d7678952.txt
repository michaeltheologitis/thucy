Data source discovery
- Available DB: PostgreSQL (TabFact / postgres_tabfact29), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football (columns: position, team, points, played, against, difference).

Evidence and queries
1) Inspect table rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football LIMIT 200;
Result (sample of all 9 rows):
[{"against":12,"difference":"8","played":8,"points":13,"position":1,"team":"flamengo"},
 {"against":15,"difference":"10","played":8,"points":13,"position":2,"team":"fluminense"},
 {"against":15,"difference":"4","played":8,"points":9,"position":3,"team":"corinthians"},
 {"against":19,"difference":"3","played":8,"points":8,"position":4,"team":"palestra itália"},
 {"against":23,"difference":"- 10","played":8,"points":7,"position":5,"team":"portuguesa"},
 {"against":25,"difference":"0","played":8,"points":6,"position":6,"team":"botafogo"},
 {"against":19,"difference":"- 2","played":8,"points":6,"position":7,"team":"vasco da gama"},
 {"against":25,"difference":"- 10","played":8,"points":6,"position":8,"team":"américa"},
 {"against":24,"difference":"- 13","played":8,"points":4,"position":9,"team":"são paulo"}]

2) Count how many teams share each 'against' value
SQL:
SELECT "against", COUNT(team) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY "against"
ORDER BY "against";
Result:
[{"against":12,"cnt":1}, {"against":15,"cnt":2}, {"against":19,"cnt":2}, {"against":23,"cnt":1}, {"against":24,"cnt":1}, {"against":25,"cnt":2}]

3) Maximum number of teams sharing any single 'against' value
SQL:
SELECT MAX(cnt) AS max_teams_sharing_against FROM (SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY "against") sub;
Result:
[{"max_teams_sharing_against":2}]

Conclusion
- No 'against' value is shared by more than 3 teams. The maximum sharing is 2 teams per 'against' value. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “There exists at least one goals-against value shared by more than three teams.”
- Mapped “goal score against them” to the 'against' column (goals conceded) in public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- Used the only available dataset in the connected public schema.
