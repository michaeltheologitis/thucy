Claim to verify: "Brook Lopez led the team in assists in more games than Deron Williams did."

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season (columns include: game, date, high assists, etc.)

Step 1 — Establish table scope
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Result:
- total_rows: 7
- min_game: 75
- max_game: 81
Interpretation: The table contains 7 games (game numbers 75–81) from the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season.

Step 2 — Count games where each player is listed as high assists leader (case-insensitive, name appears anywhere)
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS deron_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%deron williams%';
Result: deron_count = 3

SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS brook_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%brook lopez%';
Result: brook_count = 0

Step 3 — Show the specific games where Deron Williams appears as high assists leader
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%deron williams%' ORDER BY game;
Results:
- game: 75, date: april 1, high assists: deron williams (7)
- game: 76, date: april 3, high assists: deron williams (9)
- game: 77, date: april 5, high assists: deron williams (21)

Cross-check (narrower match confirming counts start-of-field)
SQL executed:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower("high assists") LIKE 'deron williams%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS deron_williams_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower("high assists") LIKE 'brook lopez%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS brook_lopez_count
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Returned row: {"deron_williams_count": 3, "brook_lopez_count": 0}

Conclusion based on available data
- Deron Williams led the team in assists in 3 games; Brook Lopez did so in 0 games (within games 75–81 of the 2010–11 Nets season captured in this dataset).
- Therefore, the claim that Brook Lopez led the team in assists in more games than Deron Williams did is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "lead the team in assists" as the player(s) listed in the "high assists" column for each game.
- The conclusion is grounded strictly in the available dataset, which includes games 75–81 of the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season; no other games are present in the accessible data.
