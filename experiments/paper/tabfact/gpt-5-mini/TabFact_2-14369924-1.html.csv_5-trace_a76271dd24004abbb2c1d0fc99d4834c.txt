Summary of the claim
- Claim: W230AV has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama; W269X has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia.

What data sources were checked
- Discovered and used the postgres_tabfact8 database (public schema). It contains a single table, public.wyfk, with columns: "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "fcc info".

Step 1: Verify W230AV
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") = 'w230av' OR lower("call sign") = 'w269x' ORDER BY "call sign";
Result:
- call sign: w230av, city of license: gadsden , alabama
- No row for W269X.
Conclusion from Step 1:
- W230AV is listed with city of license Gadsden, Alabama, not Anniston, Alabama.

Step 2: Investigate the W269X portion and close variants
Executed SQL to check for a similar call sign that might have been intended:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE lower("call sign") = 'w269ax' ORDER BY "call sign";
Result:
- call sign: w269ax, city of license: anniston , alabama
Executed SQL to list any call signs starting with W269 (case-insensitive):
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" ILIKE 'W269%';
Result:
- call sign: w269ax, city of license: anniston , alabama
Conclusion from Step 2:
- There is no exact match for W269X in the data. The closest present is W269AX, whose city of license is Anniston, Alabama (not Griffin, Georgia).

Step 3: Check for any station licensed to Griffin, Georgia
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%griffin , georgia%';
Result:
- call sign: w290ag, city of license: griffin , georgia
Conclusion from Step 3:
- The dataset does contain a station licensed to Griffin, Georgia (W290AG), but not W269X.

Overall assessment by claim component
- W230AV city of license is Anniston, Alabama: False. Data shows Gadsden, Alabama.
- W269X city of license is Griffin, Georgia: False. No such call sign found; the similar W269AX is licensed to Anniston, Alabama.

Assumptions
- The wyfk table is authoritative for the call signs in question.
- The table stores call signs in lowercase, so case-insensitive matching was used.
- The claim’s "W269X" may be a typographical omission of the second letter (e.g., W269AX), which is the common FM translator call sign format.
