Summary
- Claim: “AC Sparta Prague and team Netherlands are both located on the Asian continent.”
- Finding: Data shows both are located in Europe, not Asia.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs with columns: no (text), football club (text), continent (text), associated football club (text), seasons (text), racing drivers (text).

Evidence 1: AC Sparta Prague continent
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", "continent" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%sparta%';
- Result:
  football club: ac sparta prague | continent: europe
- Interpretation: AC Sparta Prague is recorded as being in Europe.

Evidence 2: Team Netherlands continent
- Executed SQL (search for “netherlands” in club name):
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%netherlands%';
- Result:
  football club: team netherlands | continent: europe
- Executed SQL (specific phrase check; none found, included for completeness):
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE lower("football club") LIKE '%netherlands national%';
- Result: no rows
- Interpretation: An entry named “team netherlands” exists and is recorded as being in Europe.

Conclusion
- Both “ac sparta prague” and “team netherlands” are listed with continent = Europe. The claim that both are located on the Asian continent is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “team netherlands” in the dataset corresponds to the entity referred to as “team netherlands” in the claim. Matching was case-insensitive substring on the football club name field.
