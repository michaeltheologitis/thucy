Claim to verify: “the date of vacancy be 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach be carlos azenha.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source (postgres_tabfact17) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga (records head-coach changes, including date of vacancy and incoming head coach).

Evidence
1) Query: Find any records where the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha.
SQL executed:
SELECT team, "outgoing head coach", "date of vacancy", "date of appointment", "incoming head coach"
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE lower("incoming head coach") = 'carlos azenha';

Result:
[{"team":"portimonense","outgoing head coach":"litos","date of vacancy":"28 december 2011","date of appointment":"29 december 2010","incoming head coach":"carlos azenha"}]

2) Cross-check: Show all records with date of vacancy exactly '28 december 2011'.
SQL executed:
SELECT "team", "outgoing head coach", "incoming head coach", "date of vacancy", "date of appointment" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE "date of vacancy" = '28 december 2011';

Result:
- team: portimonense | outgoing head coach: litos | incoming head coach: carlos azenha | date of vacancy: 28 december 2011 | date of appointment: 29 december 2010

Assessment
- The dataset contains a record for Portimonense where the incoming head coach is “carlos azenha” and the “date of vacancy” is “28 december 2011.” This directly supports the claim as stated.
- Note: The table also lists a “date of appointment” of “29 december 2010” for the same record, which is earlier than the vacancy date. While unusual, this discrepancy does not affect verification of the specific claim about the vacancy date and incoming head coach pairing.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to entries in the available Primeira Liga head-coach changes dataset (public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga).
- Dates and names are taken verbatim from the dataset, which stores them as lowercase text strings.
