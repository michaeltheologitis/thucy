Relevant schema identified

  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)
  - This table contains golfer names and their associated country.

Evidence query and results
- Purpose: Verify the countries associated with Henrik Stenson, Aaron Baddeley, and Charlie Wi.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player IN ('henrik stenson', 'aaron baddeley', 'charlie wi');
- Results:
  - Henrik Stenson → Sweden
  - Aaron Baddeley → Australia
  - Charlie Wi → South Korea

Assessment of the claim
- "henrik stenson be from sweden" → Supported by data (country = Sweden).
- "aaron baddeley be from australia" → Supported by data (country = Australia).
- "charlie wi be from south korea" → Supported by data (country = South Korea).

Conclusion
- All three parts of the claim are consistent with the data retrieved from the authoritative table.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "be from" as the nationality/country listed in the tournament table’s country column (player representation), not birthplace.
- Player name matching was case-insensitive; the table stores names in lowercase, as reflected in the executed SQL literals.
