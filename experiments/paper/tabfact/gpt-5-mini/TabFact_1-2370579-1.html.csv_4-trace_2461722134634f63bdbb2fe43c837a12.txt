Claim being checked: “On 30 November 1966, the episode ‘The Kill (Part Two)’ originally aired.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: the_baron

Schema details for public.the_baron
- Columns: episode (bigint), prod (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), originalairdate (text), filmed (text)

Evidence collected
1) Search for any episode titles containing “Kill”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "title", "originalairdate" FROM public.the_baron WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Kill%';
- Result rows:
  - title: the killing (part two), originalairdate: 9 november 1966
  - title: time to kill, originalairdate: 18 january 1967

2) Retrieve the air date for the matching two-parter found: “the killing (part two)”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "originalairdate" FROM public.the_baron WHERE "title" = 'the killing (part two)';
- Result:
  - originalairdate: 9 november 1966

3) Check if there is an episode titled exactly “the kill (part two)”
- SQL executed (exact match):
  SELECT originalairdate FROM public.the_baron WHERE title = 'the kill (part two)';
- Result: no rows
- SQL executed (case-insensitive exact match):
  SELECT title, originalairdate FROM public.the_baron WHERE lower(title) = 'the kill (part two)';
- Result: no rows

4) Identify which episode (if any) aired on 30 November 1966
- SQL executed:
  SELECT title, originalairdate FROM public.the_baron WHERE lower(originalairdate) LIKE '%30 november 1966%';
- Result row:
  - title: the legions of ammak, originalairdate: 30 november 1966

Conclusion
- The database contains “the killing (part two)” (not “the kill (part two)”) with an original air date of 9 November 1966.
- The date 30 November 1966 corresponds to a different episode: “the legions of ammak”.
- Therefore, the claim that “The Kill (Part Two)” originally aired on 30 November 1966 is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The intended series is “The Baron” (1966–67), given the table name and episode list in the available database.
- “The kill (part two)” in the claim refers to the two-parter listed as “the killing (part two)” in the data. If the claim was about a different series or a different regional air date, that information is not present in the available data; conclusions are based strictly on the provided database.
