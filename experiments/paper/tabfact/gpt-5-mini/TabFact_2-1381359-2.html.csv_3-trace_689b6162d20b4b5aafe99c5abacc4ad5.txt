What I checked
- I discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table relevant to the claim: public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship, with columns including title, season, winner, and runner - up.

Evidence from data
- I queried the table for the 32nd championship entry.

Executed SQL:
SELECT title, season, winner, "runner - up" FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE title LIKE '%32nd%';

Query result:
- title: 32nd
- season: 1995 - 6 details
- winner: meiji
- runner - up: waseda

Assessment
- The data explicitly shows that for the 32nd championship, the winner was meiji and the runner-up was waseda. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- I interpreted "32nd title" to mean the 32nd edition of the All-Japan University Rugby Championship recorded in the available dataset.
