Claim to verify: “When the team is União de Leiria, the date of appointment is 10 July 2010.”

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2010_11_primeira_liga
- Relevant columns: team, incoming head coach, date of appointment

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, "incoming head coach", "date of appointment" 
  FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
  WHERE team ILIKE '%Leiria%';

- Result returned:
  - team: união de leiria
  - incoming head coach: pedro caixinha
  - date of appointment: 10 july 2010

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists “união de leiria” with “date of appointment” = “10 july 2010” for the incoming head coach. This matches the claim exactly.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “date of appointment” refers to the appointment date of the incoming head coach as represented by the “date of appointment” column in the t_2010_11_primeira_liga table.
