Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single table in the public schema: public.my_info_table.
- Schema (relevant columns): season (text), events (bigint), cashes (bigint), "match play" (bigint), plus other fields.

Evidence
1) Locate the exact season row
SQL:
SELECT season, cashes, "match play", events
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE season = '2002 - 03';
Result:
- season: 2002 - 03; cashes: 6; match play: 2; events: 7

2) Season string discovery (shows how the season is stored)
SQL:
SELECT season, cashes, "match play", events
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE season ILIKE '%2002%' OR season ILIKE '%2003%'
ORDER BY season;
Relevant returned row:
- season: 2002 - 03; cashes: 6; match play: 2; events: 7

Assessment of the claim
- “6 cash” → cashes = 6 (matches data).
- “a match play smaller than 13” → match play = 2, which is < 13 (matches condition).
- “7 event” → events = 7 (matches data).

Conclusion: All elements of the claim align with the data for season 2002 - 03.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “2002 - 2003 season” as the row labeled “2002 - 03”.
- Interpreted “6 cash” as cashes = 6; “7 event” as events = 7; and “match play smaller than 13” as the match play count being less than 13.
