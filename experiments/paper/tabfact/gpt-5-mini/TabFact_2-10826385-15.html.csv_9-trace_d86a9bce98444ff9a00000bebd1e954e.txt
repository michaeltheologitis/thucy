Claim to verify: "more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10"

How I interpreted the claim
- Interpreted "score" as the away team’s total points (the number in parentheses in the AFL score format G.B (T)).
- Interpreted "more than half of the away team" as “in more than half of match records in the dataset, the away team’s total points exceed 10.”

Data source
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1972_vfl_season
- Relevant columns: "away team", "away team score" (formatted as goals.behinds (total_points))

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows and confirm format; count total rows
Executed SQL (sample rows):
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date", "venue" FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Sample results included away team scores like: 9.11 (65), 17.9 (111), 8.15 (63), 15.8 (98), etc.

Executed SQL (row count):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Result: 6

2) Count matches where away team total points > 10
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_gt_10 FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE (substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int > 10;
Result: {"count_gt_10": 6}

3) Compute fraction and boolean flag (more than half?)
Executed SQL:
SELECT total_rows, count_gt_10, (count_gt_10::numeric / NULLIF(total_rows,0)) AS fraction, (count_gt_10 > total_rows/2) AS more_than_half FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season) t CROSS JOIN (SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_gt_10 FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE (substring("away team score" from '\((\d+)\)'))::int > 10) g;
Result: {"total_rows": 6, "count_gt_10": 6, "fraction": 1.0, "more_than_half": true}

Conclusion
- All 6 out of 6 matches have away team total points > 10. Therefore, more than half is true.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to total points (the number in parentheses) in the AFL scoring format.
- The claim pertains to the records present in public.t_1972_vfl_season; i.e., across match records, not individual players or a specific team instance.
- No rows with malformed scores affected the result (none were present).
