Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the game on March 10 is when G. Payton’s high assists total of 8 occurred.

Data discovery and schema grounding
- Discovered source: PostgreSQL instance (TabFact/postgres_tabfact14), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence 1: What happened on March 10?
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE date ILIKE '%Mar%';
Result (distinct March dates):
[{"date":"march 19"},{"date":"march 27"},{"date":"march 3"},{"date":"march 5"},{"date":"march 7"},{"date":"march 10"},{"date":"march 28"},{"date":"march 11"},{"date":"march 21"},{"date":"march 1"},{"date":"march 17"},{"date":"march 8"},{"date":"march 15"},{"date":"march 24"},{"date":"march 22"}]

SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high assists" FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE date = 'march 10';
Result:
[{"date":"march 10","game":63,"high assists":"n mcmillan (5)","score":"l 92 - 98","team":"detroit pistons"}]
Finding: On March 10, the high assists were by n mcmillan (5), not by g payton.

Evidence 2: When did G. Payton record exactly 8 high assists?
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "high assists" AS high_assists, (array_to_string(regexp_matches("high assists", '([0-9]+)'), ''))::int AS assists
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%g payton%';

SQL executed:
SELECT date, "high assists" AS high_assists, regexp_replace("high assists", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS assists,
CASE WHEN regexp_replace("high assists", '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int = 8 THEN 'YES' ELSE 'NO' END AS exactly_8
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%g payton%';
Results (date — high_assists — assists — exactly_8):
- march 3 — g payton (9) — 9 — NO
- march 5 — g payton (12) — 12 — NO
- march 8 — g payton (7) — 7 — NO
- march 11 — g payton (9) — 9 — NO
- march 15 — g payton (8) — 8 — YES
- march 19 — g payton (11) — 11 — NO
- march 24 — n mcmillan , g payton (7) — 7 — NO
Finding: The only instance of g payton with exactly 8 high assists occurred on March 15, not March 10.

Conclusion
- The claim that G. Payton’s high assist total of 8 occurred on March 10 is contradicted by the data. On March 10, the high assists were by N. McMillan (5). G. Payton’s game with 8 high assists occurred on March 15.

Assumptions
- “G Payton” refers to Gary Payton.
- The user’s claim pertains to the 1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics season data represented in the only available table. Dates are stored as lowercase text (e.g., “march 10”).
