Claim interpreted: In the 1996 PGA Championship table, Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry are tied for the lowest to-par score.

What I checked
- Identified the relevant dataset (TabFact) and table (t_1996_pga_championship) containing player scores and “to par”.
- Verified the players’ entries and computed the minimum “to par” value and who achieved it.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Locate entries for Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry
SQL:
SELECT player, place, "to par", score FROM t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Mark Brook%' OR player ILIKE '%Mark Brooks%' OR player ILIKE '%Kenny Perry%';
Result (abridged):
- player: mark brooks, place: 1, to par: "- 11", score: "68 + 70 + 69 + 70 = 277"
- player: kenny perry, place: 2, to par: "- 11", score: "66 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 277"

2) Compute the minimum normalized “to par”
SQL:
WITH norm AS (
  SELECT player, "to par" AS orig_to_par,
    CASE
      WHEN trim("to par") = 'E' THEN 0
      ELSE CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(trim("to par"), ' ', ''), E'\u2212', '-'), '−', '-') AS integer)
    END AS to_par_numeric
  FROM t_1996_pga_championship
)
SELECT MIN(to_par_numeric) AS min_to_par FROM norm;
Result: min_to_par = -11

3) List players with that minimum
SQL:
WITH norm AS (
  SELECT player, place, "to par" AS orig_to_par,
    CASE
      WHEN trim("to par") = 'E' THEN 0
      ELSE CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE(trim("to par"), ' ', ''), E'\u2212', '-'), '−', '-') AS integer)
    END AS to_par_numeric
  FROM t_1996_pga_championship
)
SELECT player, place, orig_to_par, to_par_numeric FROM norm WHERE to_par_numeric = (SELECT MIN(to_par_numeric) FROM norm) ORDER BY place::int;
Result:
- mark brooks, place: 1, orig_to_par: "- 11", to_par_numeric: -11
- kenny perry, place: 2, orig_to_par: "- 11", to_par_numeric: -11

Conclusion
- Verified: Both Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry share the lowest to-par score in the table (-11). The name in the data is “mark brooks” (with an “s”).

Assumptions
- “Lowest to par” refers to the minimum “to par” value within the 1996 PGA Championship table (t_1996_pga_championship).
- Treated “E” as 0 and normalized minus signs and spaces in the “to par” field.
- Interpreted “mark brook” as “mark brooks.”
