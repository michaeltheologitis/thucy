Scope and data source
- Database discovered: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema
- Relevant table: public.media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner)
- Interpretation: The available authoritative data covers radio stations in Kelowna. I verify the claim within this market, as that is what the data supports.

Key checks performed
1) How many stations are owned by Bell Media in this dataset?
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS bell_media_count FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%Bell Media%';
- Result: 2

- SQL (details):
  SELECT "call sign" AS call_sign, branding, frequency FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%Bell Media%' ORDER BY "call sign";
- Result rows:
  • chsu - fm — 99.9 sun fm — 00 99.9 fm
  • cilk - fm — 101.5 ez rock — 0 101.5 fm

2) How many stations are owned by CBC (Canadian Broadcasting Corporation) in this dataset?
- SQL (count):
  SELECT count(*) AS total FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(owner) = 'canadian broadcasting corporation';
- Result: 3

- SQL (details):
  SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(owner) = 'canadian broadcasting corporation' ORDER BY "call sign";
- Result rows:
  • cbtk - fm — cbc radio one — 00 88.9 fm
  • cbu - fm - 3 — cbc radio 2 — 00 89.7 fm
  • cbuf - fm - 2 — première chaîne — 00 90.5 fm

3) Context: owners and their station counts in the dataset
- SQL:
  SELECT COALESCE(owner, '(unknown)') AS owner, COUNT(*) AS station_count
  FROM public.media_in_kelowna
  GROUP BY COALESCE(owner, '(unknown)')
  ORDER BY station_count DESC, owner;
- Results (owner — station_count):
  • canadian broadcasting corporation — 3
  • bell media — 2
  • jim pattison group — 2
  • astral media — 1
  • sun country cablevision — 1
  • vista broadcast group — 1

Conclusion
- In the Kelowna market represented by the authoritative dataset, Bell Media owns 2 radio stations, while the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation owns 3. The claim that “Bell Media own 3 separate radio station like the CBC” is not supported by the data here; Bell Media has fewer (2, not 3) in this dataset.

Assumptions and notes
- The claim was evaluated within the scope of the available data (Kelowna radio stations).
- “CBC” is interpreted as the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, which appears in the owner field as “canadian broadcasting corporation”.
- Exact string matching was case-insensitive where appropriate.
- The table also lists one station with owner “astral media.” While Astral Media was historically acquired by Bell, the dataset treats it as a separate owner; I did not consolidate ownership beyond what the data explicitly records.
