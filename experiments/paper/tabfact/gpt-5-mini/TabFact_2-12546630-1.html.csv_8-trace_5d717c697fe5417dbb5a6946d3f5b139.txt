Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and located a dedicated table for the 1933 Giro d’Italia.
- Inspected the schema to understand available columns (date, course, distance, winner, race leader).
- Queried the dataset to retrieve stage winners for May 24, 25, and 26, 1933.

Discovered data source
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1933_giro_d_italia
  - Columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text)

Evidence
1) Full table ordered by date (as stored)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, course, distance, winner, "race leader" FROM t_1933_giro_d_italia ORDER BY date;
Key returned rows relevant to May 24–26:
- 24 may — ferrara to udine — winner: ettore meini ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
- 25 may — udine to bassano del grappa — winner: ettore meini ( ita ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )
- 26 may — bassano del grappa to bolzano — winner: gerard loncke ( bel ) — race leader: alfredo binda ( ita )

2) Targeted filter for the three dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, course, winner
FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
WHERE lower(trim(date)) IN ('24 may', '25 may', '26 may')
ORDER BY CASE lower(trim(date)) WHEN '24 may' THEN 1 WHEN '25 may' THEN 2 WHEN '26 may' THEN 3 END;
Results:
- 24 may | ferrara to udine | ettore meini ( ita )
- 25 may | udine to bassano del grappa | ettore meini ( ita )
- 26 may | bassano del grappa to bolzano | gerard loncke ( bel )

Assessment
- The claim states that Ettore Meini won three races in a row on May 24, 25, and 26 during the 1933 Giro d’Italia.
- The data shows: Meini won on May 24 and May 25, but the May 26 stage was won by Gerard Loncke.
- Therefore, Meini did not win three consecutive stages on those dates; he won two in a row (May 24–25), not three.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the dataset. Ettore Meini did not win on May 26, 1933.

Assumptions
- The date field represents the stage day within the 1933 Giro and is stored as text without the year (e.g., "24 may").
- The table t_1933_giro_d_italia is authoritative for stage winners and dates for the 1933 edition.
