Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. Excluding seasons with gb = '5', the average win percentage is 0.513 (not 0.553).

Evidence and calculations grounded in the data

1) Data source and relevant table
- Discovered a single table with the needed fields: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons, which includes columns year, record, "win %" (stored as an integer like 567 for 0.567), and gb (games behind as text).

Sample rows (to understand data formats)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, record, "win %", gb FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons LIMIT 20;
Returned examples (abbrev.):
- 1978 | 64 - 77 | 454 | 22½
- 1979 | 83 - 61 | 576 | -
- 1980 | 97 - 46 | 678 | -
... (showing that "win %" is scaled by 1000 and gb is text like '-', '3½', '12', etc.)

2) Distinct gb values (to locate any '5')
SQL executed:
SELECT gb, COUNT(*) AS cnt, (gb ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$') AS is_numeric, CASE WHEN gb ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN gb::numeric END AS numeric_value
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
GROUP BY gb
ORDER BY (CASE WHEN gb ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN 0 ELSE 1 END), numeric_value, gb;
Key result points:
- There is exactly one season with gb = '5'.

Check for exact '5':
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_exact_5 FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';
Result: count_exact_5 = 1

3) Average win percentage excluding gb = '5'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS included_seasons
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE COALESCE(gb, '') <> '5';
Result: included_seasons = 35

SQL executed:
SELECT AVG("win %") AS mean_win_percent
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE COALESCE(gb, '') <> '5';
Result: mean_win_percent = 513.1714285714286

SQL executed:
SELECT ROUND(AVG("win %")/1000.0, 3) AS mean_win_decimal_3dp
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE COALESCE(gb, '') <> '5';
Result: mean_win_decimal_3dp = 0.513

Therefore, the average win percentage for seasons without gb = '5' is 0.513, not 0.553.

4) Context check (overall average across all seasons)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, AVG("win %") AS raw, ROUND(AVG("win %")/1000.0, 3) AS scaled_decimal_3dp FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons;
Results: count = 36; raw = 513.7777777777778; scaled_decimal_3dp = 0.514

Assumptions
- Interpreted “season without a gb of 5” to mean: include all seasons where gb ≠ '5' exactly, based on the gb text field in public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons.
- Interpreted “average win percentage” as the arithmetic mean of the "win %" column after scaling by 1000 to convert to a decimal (e.g., 567 → 0.567).
