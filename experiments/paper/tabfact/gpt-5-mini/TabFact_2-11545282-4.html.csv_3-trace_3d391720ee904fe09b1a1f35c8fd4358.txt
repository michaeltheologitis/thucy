Claim: "james donaldson have 2 stint on the jazz's roster"

Summary conclusion: The Utah Jazz all-time roster table lists James Donaldson with years for the Jazz as "1993 , 1994 - 95", indicating two distinct, non-consecutive stints. This supports the claim of two stints on the Jazz roster.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public).
- Identified a relevant table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster with columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Check whether James Donaldson appears in the Jazz all-time roster and retrieve his tenure years:
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE player ILIKE '%James Donaldson%';

Result:
- player: james donaldson
- position: center
- years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95

Interpretation
- The "years for jazz" field explicitly lists two separate time spans: a single year (1993) and a later span (1994–95). The comma separation indicates non-contiguous periods, i.e., two stints.

Assumptions
- "Jazz" refers to the NBA's Utah Jazz.
- "Stint" is interpreted as a non-contiguous tenure segment; the comma-separated entries in the "years for jazz" field represent separate stints.
