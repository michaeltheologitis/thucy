Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. In the 2007–08 Toronto Raptors season table, the entry for November 24 shows a loss to Cleveland with a final score of 108–111 in overtime.

Key evidence from the database:
1) Context check (date/score format)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_08_toronto_raptors_season ORDER BY game ASC LIMIT 10;
Observation: Dates appear as lowercase month and day (e.g., "november 20"), and the score field includes result (w/l), scoreline, and optional “(ot)”.

2) Target game verification
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_08_toronto_raptors_season WHERE date = 'november 24' AND team ILIKE '%cleveland%';
Result:
{date: "november 24", game: 13, team: "cleveland", score: "l 108 - 111 (ot)", high points: "chris bosh (41)", high rebounds: "anthony parker (7)", high assists: "josé calderón (13)", location attendance: "quicken loans arena 20018", record: "6 - 7"}
Interpretation: The entry explicitly shows a loss ("l") by Toronto to Cleveland, with a score of 108–111, and the game went to overtime ("(ot)").

Assumptions:
- The database available contains the 2007–08 Toronto Raptors season. Since dates in the table have no year, I interpret “November 24” as November 24 of the 2007–08 season dataset.
- Opponent matching was done case-insensitively on the team name “cleveland”.
