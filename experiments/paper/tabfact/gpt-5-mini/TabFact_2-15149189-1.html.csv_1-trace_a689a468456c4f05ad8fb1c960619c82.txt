Summary of the claim assessed
- Interpreted claim: “The player born on 2 November 1987 is a fly-half, and is the only one for a Sale player (i.e., the only Sale fly-half).”

Data sources explored
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL database, schema public.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads (columns: player, position, date of birth (age), caps, club / province).

Evidence gathered
1) Identify player(s) born on 2 November 1987
SQL executed:
SELECT player, position, "date of birth (age)", "club / province"
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
WHERE lower("date of birth (age)") LIKE ANY (ARRAY['%2 november 1987%','%02 november 1987%','%2 nov 1987%','%02 nov 1987%']);
Result:
- player: danny cipriani | position: fly - half | date of birth (age): 2 november 1987 | club / province: wasps
Finding: The player born on 2 November 1987 in this dataset is Danny Cipriani, and his listed position is fly-half. His club/province is Wasps (not Sale).

2) List all Sale players in the dataset
SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
WHERE lower("club / province") LIKE '%sale%';
Result: match_count = 5

SQL executed (list):
SELECT player, position, "date of birth (age)", "club / province"
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
WHERE lower("club / province") LIKE '%sale%'
ORDER BY player;
Results:
- andrew sheridan — prop — 1 november 1979 — sale
- charlie hodgson — fly - half — 12 november 1980 — sale
- magnus lund — flanker — 25 june 1983 — sale
- mark cueto — fullback — 26 december 1979 — sale
- richard wigglesworth — scrum - half — 9 june 1983 — sale
Finding: There are five Sale players listed; among them, the fly-half is Charlie Hodgson (DOB 12 Nov 1980), not born on 2 Nov 1987.

3) Confirm how many Sale fly-halves are present
SQL executed (distinct positions for Sale):
SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads WHERE lower("club / province") LIKE '%sale%';
Result: flanker; fly - half; fullback; prop; scrum - half

SQL executed (count per position for Sale):
SELECT position, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
WHERE lower("club / province") LIKE '%sale%'
GROUP BY position
ORDER BY player_count DESC, position;
Result: each listed position has 1 player; specifically fly - half: 1

SQL executed (specific fly-half count for Sale):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS fly_half_count
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
WHERE lower("club / province") LIKE '%sale%'
  AND lower(trim(position)) = 'fly - half';
Result: fly_half_count = 1
Finding: The dataset has exactly one Sale fly-half (Charlie Hodgson), whose DOB is 12 November 1980.

Conclusion
- True: The player born on 2 November 1987 (Danny Cipriani) is a fly-half.
- Not supported/Contradicted: That this player is a Sale player in this dataset; he is listed with Wasps. Also, while there is exactly one Sale fly-half, it is Charlie Hodgson (DOB 12 November 1980), not the player born 2 November 1987.

Overall assessment: The claim mixes a correct fact (DOB 2 Nov 1987 fly-half) with incorrect/mismatched details about Sale and uniqueness.

Assumptions made
- “bear” interpreted as “born.”
- “sale player” interpreted as players whose club/province contains “Sale.”
- “the only 1” interpreted as uniqueness of the fly-half position among Sale players within this dataset.
