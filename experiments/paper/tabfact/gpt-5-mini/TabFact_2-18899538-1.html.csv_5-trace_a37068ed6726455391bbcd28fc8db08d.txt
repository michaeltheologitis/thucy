Claim: “GPL is the license for Rygel.”

Data sources checked
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table relevant to UPnP AV media servers: public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers, which includes columns name and license.

Evidence from data
- Query target: Find the license listed for the media server named Rygel.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name ILIKE '%Rygel%';

Result returned by the query
- name: rygel
- license: lgplv2
- os x: no
- unix - like: yes
- web interface: no
- windows: no

Assessment
- The table lists Rygel’s license as “lgplv2,” not GPL. Therefore, the claim that “GPL is the license for Rygel” is contradicted by the available data.

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative data source, Rygel is listed under the LGPLv2 license, not GPL.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as asking whether Rygel’s license is GPL. Per the database, it is “lgplv2.”
- Used a case-insensitive search to match the project name as stored in the table (rygel).
