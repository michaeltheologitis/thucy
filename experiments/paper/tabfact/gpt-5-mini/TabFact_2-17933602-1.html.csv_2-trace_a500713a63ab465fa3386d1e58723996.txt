Claim to verify: “José Couceiro be the head coach in Setúbal, and it be Manuel Machado in Guimarães.”

Data source consulted: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17) → public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga
- Relevant columns: club, head coach, city, stadium, 2003 - 2004 season

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Full table scan to see clubs and head coaches
SQL executed:
SELECT club, "head coach", city, stadium, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga;
Key returned rows (club — head coach):
- vitória de guimarães — manuel machado
- vitória de setúbal — josé couceiro

2) Focused retrieval for the two Vitória clubs
SQL executed:
SELECT club, "head coach" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE club ILIKE '%Vit%';
Returned rows:
- {club: "vitória de guimarães", head coach: "manuel machado"}
- {club: "vitória de setúbal", head coach: "josé couceiro"}

Conclusion:
- The 2004–05 season table lists José Couceiro as head coach for Vitória de Setúbal and Manuel Machado as head coach for Vitória de Guimarães. This directly supports the claim within the scope of the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “Setúbal” refers to the club Vitória de Setúbal, and “Guimarães” refers to Vitória de Guimarães.
- Timing is interpreted as the 2004–05 season, since that is the season covered by the available dataset.
