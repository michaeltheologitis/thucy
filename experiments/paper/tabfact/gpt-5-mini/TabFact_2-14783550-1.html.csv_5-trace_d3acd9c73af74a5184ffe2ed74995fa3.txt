Claim to verify: “Pakistan and Yemen have won 3 bronze medals for wushu at the Asian Games.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible relational database: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: wushu_at_the_asian_games with columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect how nation names are stored to match correctly
SQL:
SELECT * FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games LIMIT 200;
Observed (relevant rows):
- nation = "pakistan (pak)", bronze = 1
- nation = "yemen (yem)", bronze = 1

2) Retrieve bronze counts for Pakistan and Yemen
SQL:
SELECT nation, bronze FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games WHERE nation ILIKE '%pakistan%' OR nation ILIKE '%yemen%' ORDER BY nation;
Result:
- pakistan (pak): bronze = 1
- yemen (yem): bronze = 1

3) Compute combined bronze total for Pakistan and Yemen
SQL:
SELECT SUM(bronze) AS combined_bronze FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games WHERE nation ILIKE '%pakistan%' OR nation ILIKE '%yemen%';
Result:
- combined_bronze = 2

Assessment
- Pakistan has 1 bronze in wushu at the Asian Games.
- Yemen has 1 bronze in wushu at the Asian Games.
- Combined, Pakistan and Yemen have 2 bronze medals, not 3.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Pakistan and Yemen together have 2 bronze medals in wushu at the Asian Games, not 3.

Assumptions
- “Asian game” is interpreted as the Asian Games, and the table wushu_at_the_asian_games is the authoritative source for medal counts.
- The claim “have win 3 bronze medal” is interpreted as the combined bronze total for Pakistan and Yemen equals 3. If the intent were 3 each, that is also contradicted (each has 1).
