Claim being checked: "the team with a record of 34 - 27 have 7 high assist by n mcmillan"

Conclusion: Supported by the data in the available season table for the 1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics.

What the data shows
- In the table public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season, there is a single row where the record is stored as "34 - 27". For that game, the "high assists" field is "n mcmillan (7)", which matches the claim that the high assists were 7 by N. McMillan.

Executed SQL evidence and results
1) Check if the table used the exact formatting "34-27" (no spaces):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
WHERE record LIKE '%34-27%';
Result:
[{"cnt":0}]

2) Inspect how records are formatted in the table:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT record
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
ORDER BY record
LIMIT 100;
Result (excerpt includes the target):
{"record":"34 - 27"} (records have spaces around the dash)

3) Retrieve the row for the record "34 - 27" and inspect high assists:
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high assists", record
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season
WHERE record = '34 - 27'
ORDER BY game;
Result:
{
  "game": 61,
  "date": "march 7",
  "team": "new jersey nets",
  "score": "w 109 - 98",
  "high assists": "n mcmillan (7)",
  "record": "34 - 27"
}

Assessment of the claim’s components
- Record "34 - 27": Matches the stored record value.
- High assists count "7": Matches the value in the row (7).
- Player "n mcmillan": Matches the player cited in the "high assists" field ("n mcmillan").

Assumptions
- "the team" refers to the Seattle SuperSonics entry within the 1991–92 season table, which records each game with the SuperSonics’ running record after the game.
- The statement refers to the game-context high assists leader field labeled "high assists" in the dataset, which is formatted as "player (number)".
