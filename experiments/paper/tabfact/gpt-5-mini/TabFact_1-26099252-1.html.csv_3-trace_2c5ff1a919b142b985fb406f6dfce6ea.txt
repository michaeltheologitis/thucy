Claim to verify: “konqueror support only vp8 (webm) 4.4 , but not vp9 (webm)”

What the data shows
- Source table: public.html5_video (authoritative dataset of browser video codec support)
- Relevant row for Konqueror (all columns):
  • browser: konqueror
  • operating system: all supported
  • latest stable release: 4.11.2 (1 october 2013 )
  • theora: 4.4
  • h264: 4.4
  • vp8 ( webm ): 4.4
  • vp9 ( webm ): no

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Locate Konqueror row and fetch the codec columns:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE browser ILIKE '%Konqueror%';
Result:
- browser: konqueror
- latest stable release: 4.11.2 (1 october 2013 )
- vp8 ( webm ): 4.4
- vp9 ( webm ): no

2) Retrieve all columns for completeness:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE browser ILIKE '%konqueror%';
Result (all columns):
- browser: konqueror
- operating system: all supported
- latest stable release: 4.11.2 (1 october 2013 )
- theora: 4.4
- h264: 4.4
- vp8 ( webm ): 4.4
- vp9 ( webm ): no

Assessment
- WebM/VP8: Supported, with the support level indicated as “4.4.”
- WebM/VP9: Not supported (“no”).
- Therefore, as a statement specifically about WebM codecs, the claim matches the data: Konqueror supports VP8 (since 4.4) but not VP9.
- Note: Konqueror also supports Theora and H.264 (both indicated as 4.4). This does not contradict the claim if “only” is interpreted as “only among WebM codecs.”

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the dataset. Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) at 4.4 and does not support VP9 (WebM).

Assumptions made
- “only” is interpreted in the context of WebM codecs (VP8 vs VP9), not as excluding other codecs like Theora or H.264.
- The value “4.4” under a codec column denotes the version from which support is available for that codec in Konqueror.
