Executed SQL (evidence) and results
1) Verify table column names
SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008';
Result:
[{"column_name":"team"}, {"column_name":"outgoing manager"}, {"column_name":"manner of departure"}, {"column_name":"date of vacancy"}, {"column_name":"replaced by"}, {"column_name":"date of appointment"}, {"column_name":"position in table"}]

2) Inspect distinct outgoing manager values
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "outgoing manager" FROM public."primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008" ORDER BY "outgoing manager";
Result:
[{"outgoing manager":"agustín castillo"}, {"outgoing manager":"daniel uberti"}, {"outgoing manager":"gerardo reinoso"}, {"outgoing manager":"gustavo de simone"}, {"outgoing manager":"mauricio cienfuegos"}, {"outgoing manager":"nelson ancheta"}, {"outgoing manager":"oscar benítez"}, {"outgoing manager":"pablo centrone"}, {"outgoing manager":"roberto gamarra"}]

3) Retrieve the specific row for Uberti -> Ancheta transition
SQL:
SELECT "team", "outgoing manager", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "replaced by", "date of appointment", "position in table"
FROM public."primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008"
WHERE LOWER("outgoing manager") = 'daniel uberti' AND LOWER("replaced by") = 'nelson ancheta';
Result:
[{"date of appointment":"29 december 2008","date of vacancy":"29 december 2008","manner of departure":"sacked","outgoing manager":"daniel uberti","position in table":"post - season (10th)","replaced by":"nelson ancheta","team":"nejapa"}]

Assessment
- The data directly matches the claim: Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008 and Ancheta was appointed on the same date.

Assumptions
- Treated the claim’s wording "be sack" as "was sacked" and matched dates case-insensitively (e.g., "Dec 29 2008" equals "29 december 2008").
