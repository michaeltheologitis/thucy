Claim to verify
- "Carmelo Anthony [was] the leading scorer on the Nuggets for 10 out of the 13 games played in November."

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact27)
- Schema: public
- Identified table containing relevant Nuggets game logs and per-game team leader info: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Method
1) Confirm how many games in the table correspond to November and inspect the high points entries to see the leading scorer for each game.
2) Count how many of those games list Carmelo Anthony as the high points scorer versus someone else.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect rows (date and high points) and order by game
- SQL:
  SELECT game, date, "high points" FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season ORDER BY game;
- Returned (abbrev.):
  - game 3:  date "november 1"   — high points "carmelo anthony (42)"
  - game 4:  date "november 3"   — high points "carmelo anthony (25)"
  - game 5:  date "november 4"   — high points "ty lawson (23)"
  - game 7:  date "november 7"   — high points "carmelo anthony (30)"
  - game 8:  date "november 10"  — high points "carmelo anthony (20)"
  - game 9:  date "november 11"  — high points "carmelo anthony (32)"
  - game 10: date "november 13"  — high points "carmelo anthony (25)"
  - game 11: date "november 17"  — high points "carmelo anthony (32)"
  - game 12: date "november 20"  — high points "carmelo anthony (37)"
  - game 13: date "november 21"  — high points "carmelo anthony (30)"
  - game 14: date "november 24"  — high points "carmelo anthony (27)"
  - game 15: date "november 25"  — high points "carmelo anthony (22)"
  - game 16: date "november 27"  — high points "carmelo anthony (50)"

2) Confirm total number of games in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season;
- Result: total_games = 13

3) Count games listing Carmelo Anthony as the high points scorer
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS carmelo_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Carmelo Anthony%';
- Result: carmelo_games = 12

4) Count games listing someone else
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS other_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE "high points" IS NOT NULL AND "high points" NOT ILIKE '%Carmelo Anthony%';
- Result: other_games = 1

Findings
- There are 13 Nuggets games in November in this table.
- Carmelo Anthony is listed as the team’s high points scorer in 12 of those 13 games; Ty Lawson is listed once.

Conclusion
- The claim that Carmelo Anthony was the Nuggets’ leading scorer in 10 out of 13 November games is not supported by the data. The data shows 12 out of 13.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The table public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season appears to represent the Denver Nuggets’ 2009–10 season game log; the date column lists month/day in lowercase without a year. I treated all listed rows as November games from that season.
- The column "high points" is interpreted as the Nuggets’ team-leading scorer for each game (not necessarily the game-high across both teams).
