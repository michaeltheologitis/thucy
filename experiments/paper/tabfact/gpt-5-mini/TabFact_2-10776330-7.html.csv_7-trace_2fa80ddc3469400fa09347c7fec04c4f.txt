Assessment
- The dataset shows that on 3 June 1961, North Melbourne’s home score was 9.14 (68) and South Melbourne’s home score was 7.8 (50). The claim states the reverse. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Verification is grounded in the available table public.t_1961_vfl_season (1961 VFL season). Team names in the data are lowercased; queries matched team names case-insensitively and scores as exact text values.
