Claim to verify: “netherlands and romania have game on june 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998.”

Data discovery and schema
- Available data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact21)
- Relevant table: t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
  - Columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), comp (text), report (text)

Evidence 1: Do entries in 1998 mention Netherlands or Romania, and on what dates?
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
WHERE (date ILIKE '%netherlands%' OR venue ILIKE '%netherlands%' OR score ILIKE '%netherlands%' OR comp ILIKE '%netherlands%' OR report ILIKE '%netherlands%')
   OR (date ILIKE '%romania%' OR venue ILIKE '%romania%' OR score ILIKE '%romania%' OR comp ILIKE '%romania%' OR report ILIKE '%romania%');
Results (2 rows):
- { date: "1998 - 06 - 01", venue: "philips stadion eindhoven , netherlands", score: "5 - 1", comp: "f", report: "457" }
- { date: "1998 - 06 - 03", venue: "steaua stadium bucharest , romania", score: "3 - 2", comp: "f", report: "458" }
Interpretation: The table shows matches in the Netherlands (Eindhoven) on 1998-06-01 and in Romania (Bucharest) on 1998-06-03, not on June 24 or June 28.

Evidence 2: What matches occurred on 1998-06-24 and 1998-06-28 in this dataset?
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score, venue, comp FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date IN ('1998 - 06 - 24','1998 - 06 - 28');
Results:
- 1998 - 06 - 24 — comp: world cup — score: 1 - 3 — venue: "stade de toulouse toulouse , france"
- 1998 - 06 - 28 — comp: world cup — score: 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet ) — venue: "stade félix bollaert lens , france"
Interpretation: On June 24 and June 28, 1998, the matches in this table were World Cup games in France, not in the Netherlands or Romania.

Evidence 3: Do the June 24/28 rows mention Netherlands or Romania anywhere?
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report,
  ( (lower(venue) LIKE '%netherlands%') OR (lower(score) LIKE '%netherlands%') OR (lower(comp) LIKE '%netherlands%') OR (lower(report) LIKE '%netherlands%') ) AS mentions_netherlands,
  ( (lower(venue) LIKE '%romania%') OR (lower(score) LIKE '%romania%') OR (lower(comp) LIKE '%romania%') OR (lower(report) LIKE '%romania%') ) AS mentions_romania
FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
WHERE date IN ('1998 - 06 - 24','1998 - 06 - 28');
Results:
- 1998 - 06 - 24 — venue: Toulouse, France — mentions_netherlands: false — mentions_romania: false
- 1998 - 06 - 28 — venue: Lens, France — mentions_netherlands: false — mentions_romania: false
Interpretation: The dataset’s June 24 and 28 entries are in France and do not reference Netherlands or Romania.

Conclusion
- Within the authoritative dataset available, matches involving the Netherlands or Romania as venues occurred on June 1 and June 3, 1998. The matches on June 24 and June 28, 1998, were World Cup matches in France and do not mention Netherlands or Romania.
- Therefore, the claim that “netherlands and romania have game on june 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998” is not supported by the data and is contradicted by it.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as asserting that matches involving Netherlands and Romania occurred on June 24 and June 28, 1998, respectively (likely national-team fixtures). I verified against the only available 1998 football dataset (which comprehensively logs Paraguay’s 1998 matches, including friendlies in the Netherlands and Romania and World Cup fixtures). Dates in the table use the format with spaces: 'YYYY - MM - DD'.
