Conclusion: Supported by available data. In the TabFact public schema table t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season, the entry for Game 4 shows the date as "april 25".

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate Game 4 in the Spurs 2008–09 season table
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, series
  FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season

Assessment relative to the claim: The dataset shows that Game 4 (for the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs playoff series vs. Dallas) took place on April 25, thereby matching the claim that “game 4 be on april 25.”

Assumptions made:
- Because the claim did not specify a team or season, I interpreted “game 4” to refer to the Game 4 entry available in the accessible data source, which is the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season table in the TabFact database.
