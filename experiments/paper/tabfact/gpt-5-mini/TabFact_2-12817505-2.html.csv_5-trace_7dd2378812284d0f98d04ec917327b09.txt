Claim to verify: “Manchester United have always lost 3 out of 3 times to Portsmouth since 10 September 2005.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season (Manchester United’s 2005–06 season match log)
  - Columns: date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text)

Method:
1) Identify all matches vs Portsmouth in the available Manchester United 2005–06 season table.
2) Parse the text dates and filter for matches on or after 10 September 2005.
3) Check the number of matches and their results to see if Manchester United lost all and if there were three such matches.

Evidence from executed SQL:
- Query 1 (inspect all Portsmouth matches and date format):
  SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a" FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Portsmouth%';

  Results:
  1) date: 3 december 2005 | opponents: portsmouth | h / a: h | result f - a: 3 - 0
  2) date: 11 february 2006 | opponents: portsmouth | h / a: a | result f - a: 3 - 1

- Query 2 (filter to matches on or after 2005-09-10 and show parsed dates):
  SELECT date, to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a" FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Portsmouth%' AND to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') >= DATE '2005-09-10' ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY');

  Results:
  1) date: 3 december 2005 | parsed_date: 2005-12-03 | opponents: portsmouth | h / a: h | result f - a: 3 - 0
  2) date: 11 february 2006 | parsed_date: 2006-02-11 | opponents: portsmouth | h / a: a | result f - a: 3 - 1

Findings:
- Number of matches vs Portsmouth on or after 10 September 2005 in the 2005–06 season: 2 (not 3).
- Results of those matches: Manchester United won 3–0 (home) and 3–1 (away). They did not lose either match.

Conclusion:
- The available data directly contradicts the claim. Since 10 September 2005 (within the 2005–06 season data available), Manchester United did not lose to Portsmouth; they won both meetings. There are not “3 out of 3” losses, nor even three matches in this timeframe within the dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The only accessible dataset contains Manchester United’s 2005–06 season. I treated this as authoritative within its scope, but it does not include other seasons. The claim spans “since 10 September 2005,” which could include later seasons; I cannot assess those here. However, the fact that United won both relevant matches in 2005–06 already contradicts the core assertion that they “always lose 3 out of 3 times.”
- Date strings were parsed using to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY'), which correctly handled the lowercase month names present in the table.
