Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to locate relevant tables about Temple Owls games.
- Queried the only available table covering the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season for any game against Virginia Tech and examined the recorded score.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL (postgres_tabfact4), public schema
  - Table: t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team
    - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence
1) Retrieve the Temple vs. Virginia Tech game(s) in the 2009–10 season
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, team, score, "location attendance", record
  FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team
  WHERE team ILIKE '%Virginia Tech%';
- Result:
  - date: november 27
  - team: virginia tech
  - score: w 61 - 50
  - location attendance: palestra , philadelphia , pa (3750)
  - record: 4 - 1

2) Confirm how many such games appear in this season table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE team ILIKE '%Virginia Tech%';
- Result: 1

Conclusion
- In the available authoritative dataset for the 2009–10 Temple Owls men’s basketball season, the game versus Virginia Tech finished with a score of 61–50 (Temple win), not 66–46. Therefore, the stated score is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Assumed the claim refers to men’s basketball and pertains to the 2009–10 season (the only season available in the data). The column "team" is interpreted as the opponent. The database contents appear limited to the 2009–10 season; no data for other seasons or sports was available to check for a different Temple–Virginia Tech matchup with a 66–46 score.
