Claim interpreted: “4 - 1 be the 1st leg for 2004.” Interpreted as: For the 2004 edition of the Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty, the first leg score was 4–1.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL via postgres_tabfact6)
- Public schema table: public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty with columns: year, winner, runners - up, aggregate, 1st leg, 2nd leg.

Evidence:
1) Retrieve the 2004 record
Executed SQL:
SELECT "year", "winner", "runners - up", "aggregate", "1st leg", "2nd leg"
FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
WHERE "year" = 2004;

Result:
- year: 2004
- winner: san josé de los arroyos
- runners - up: durazno
- aggregate: 4 - 3
- 1st leg: 0 - 2
- 2nd leg: 4 - 1

Analysis:
- The 2004 first leg score is 0 - 2, not 4 - 1.
- The score 4 - 1 corresponds to the second leg in 2004.

Conclusion: The claim that “4 - 1” was the first leg for 2004 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to the Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty, as this is the only available authoritative dataset and it contains year-by-year first and second leg scores.
- “4 - 1 be the 1st leg for 2004” means “the first-leg score in 2004 was 4–1.”
