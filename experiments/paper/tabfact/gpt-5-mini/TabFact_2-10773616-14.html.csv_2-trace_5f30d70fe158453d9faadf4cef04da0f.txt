Claim to verify: “the away team's score at the game when Hawthorn is the home team is 9.11 (65).”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact19 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.t_1954_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check which home teams exist in this table
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT("home team") AS home_team FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
Result:
- collingwood
- carlton
- melbourne
- geelong
- south melbourne
- north melbourne
Observation: “Hawthorn” does not appear as a home team in this dataset.

2) Directly test whether any row has Hawthorn as the home team
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS hawthorn_home_count FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE "home team" = 'Hawthorn';
Result: hawthorn_home_count = 0

3) Case-insensitive check for Hawthorn as a home team (and retrieve any Hawthorn games)
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score"
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE lower("away team") = 'hawthorn' OR lower("home team") = 'hawthorn';
Result:
- date: 31 july 1954; home team: melbourne; away team: hawthorn; home team score: 16.14 (110); away team score: 5.3 (33)
Observation: Hawthorn appears only as the away team here, scoring 5.3 (33).

4) Check if any away team scored exactly 9.11 (65) in this table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "away team score" = '9.11 (65)';
Result: cnt = 0

5) Context: does 9.11 (65) appear at all (perhaps as a home score)?
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score"
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '9.11 (65)';
Result:
- date: 31 july 1954; home team: carlton; away team: richmond; home team score: 9.11 (65); away team score: 6.10 (46)
Observation: 9.11 (65) occurs as a home team score for Carlton, not as an away score and not in a game with Hawthorn as the home team.

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains no game where Hawthorn is the home team (count = 0). Therefore, the statement about “the away team's score at the game when Hawthorn is the home team” cannot be true within this data. Additionally, no away team in this table scored 9.11 (65). The specific score 9.11 (65) appears only as a home score for Carlton vs Richmond on 31 July 1954.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the only available dataset (public.t_1954_vfl_season).
- Treated team name matching literally, also verified case-insensitively.
- Accepted the dataset as authoritative for the games it contains (likely a subset of the 1954 VFL season).
