Summary conclusion:
- The data shows exactly 4 opposing teams with an "against" value of 12 in the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour table. Those teams are Cambridge University, London Counties, Munster, and Wales. Thus, there are 4 teams that scored exactly 12 points against New Zealand, one of which is Cambridge University. If the claim intended “against Cambridge University,” that is not supported by this dataset’s structure (Cambridge University appears as an opponent of New Zealand, not as a team that had opponents scoring against it within this table).

Evidence from the database (with exact executed SQL):

1) Identify how Cambridge University appears in the table and view its row
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "opposing team" FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE "opposing team" ILIKE '%cambridge%';
Result:
- cambridge university

SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE "opposing team" = 'cambridge university';
Result (one row):
- opposing team: cambridge university
- against: 12
- date: 18 october 1978
- venue: grange road , cambridge
- status: tour match

Interpretation from this row: The column "against" records the points scored by the opposing team (here, Cambridge University) against New Zealand.

2) Count and list all teams with "against" = 12
SQL:
SELECT "opposing team" FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE "against" = 12;
Result rows:
- cambridge university
- london counties
- munster
- wales

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_against_12 FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE "against" = 12;
Result:
- count_against_12 = 4

Assessment vs. the claim:
- Supported: There are 4 teams that scored exactly 12 points (the "against" value) in this dataset.
- Clarification: The phrase “against Cambridge University” does not align with how the data is organized. In the table, Cambridge University is one of the teams that scored 12 against New Zealand, not a team that had 12 scored against it by others within this dataset.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity):
- I interpret the claim to refer to the number of opposing teams during the 1978 New Zealand tour that scored exactly 12 points (i.e., rows where "against" = 12). Cambridge University is one of these teams. If the claim literally means teams that scored 12 points against Cambridge University, such a query cannot be answered from this table, which only logs opponents of New Zealand in the 1978 tour.
