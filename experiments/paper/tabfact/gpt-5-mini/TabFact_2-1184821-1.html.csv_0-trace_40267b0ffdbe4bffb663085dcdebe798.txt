Evidence queries and results
1) List all rows to understand structure
SQL:
SELECT * FROM chicagoland_speedway;
Key rows relevant to NASCAR Camping World Truck Series:
- Row 7 (section header):
  record: nascar camping world truck series; date/driver/time/speed / avg speed: all equal to "nascar camping world truck series" (serves as a header row)
- Row 8 (qualifying record for this series):
  record: qualifying; date: july 21 , 2012; driver: justin lofton; time: 31.007; speed / avg speed: -
- Row 9 (race record for this series):
  record: race; date: august 27 , 2010; driver: kyle busch; time: 1:44:31; speed / avg speed: -

2) Direct filter for the series name (confirms presence of a section header row)
SQL:
SELECT record, driver, date, time, "speed / avg speed" FROM chicagoland_speedway WHERE record ILIKE '%NASCAR Camping World Truck Series%';
Result: One row where all fields contain the string "nascar camping world truck series" (serves as the series header).

Conclusion
- Within the Chicagoland Speedway table, the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series section exists and includes:
  - Qualifying record: time 31.007 (driver: Justin Lofton; date: July 21, 2012)
  - Race record (total race time): 1:44:31 (driver: Kyle Busch; date: August 27, 2010)
- The “speed / avg speed” field is not populated for these rows in the dataset (shown as “-”).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the request as asking for the record(s) and time(s) associated with the NASCAR Camping World Truck Series at Chicagoland Speedway, since the only available dataset pertains to Chicagoland Speedway.
- Interpreted “record” entries as the best qualifying lap time and the best (shortest) total race time for that series at this venue, following the table’s structure of header row followed by “qualifying” and “race” rows.
