Claim interpreted: The largest margin by which the (Kentucky) Wildcats outscored an opponent in the available dataset is 36 points.

Data source explored: TabFact database, public schema
- Table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
- Columns: game, date, opponent, result, wildcats points, opponents, record

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Compute the maximum point differential (Wildcats points − Opponents points)
SQL:
SELECT MAX(("wildcats points" - opponents)) AS max_diff FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result:
max_diff = 36

2) Retrieve the game(s) that achieved this maximum margin
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents, ("wildcats points" - opponents) AS differential
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
WHERE ("wildcats points" - opponents) = 36;
Result:
- date: nov 15
  opponent: evansville
  result: win
  wildcats points: 36
  opponents: 0
  differential: 36

Conclusion: The data shows the largest outscoring margin is 36 points (36–0 vs Evansville on Nov 15), supporting the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Wildcat(s)” refers to the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team, as that is the only Wildcats dataset available in the connected data.
