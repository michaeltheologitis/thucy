What I checked
- Available data source: A single table in the postgres_tabfact8 database with Detroit Red Wings 2003–04 season game logs: public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season (columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record).
- Interpreted “visitor score” as the number of goals by the visiting team (the first number in the score field formatted as “visitor_score - home_score”). Interpreted “this season” as the season represented by the table (2003–04).

Step 1: Confirm score format (visitor_score is first number)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
LIMIT 10;

Results (excerpt):
- january 2 | visitor: detroit | score: 4 - 1 | home: carolina
- january 3 | visitor: anaheim | score: 1 - 3 | home: detroit
- january 5 | visitor: nashville | score: 0 - 6 | home: detroit
This shows the first number is the visitor’s goals and the second is the home team’s goals.

Step 2: What is the lowest visitor score across all games in this season?
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN((split_part(score, ' - ', 1))::int) AS min_visitor_score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;

Result:
- min_visitor_score = 0

How many games had that minimum?
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_with_min_visitor_score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE (split_part(score, ' - ', 1))::int = 0;

Result:
- games_with_min_visitor_score = 1

Which game had a visitor score of 0?
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE split_part(score,' - ',1) = '0';

Result:
- january 5 — visitor: nashville; home: detroit; score: 0 - 6

Step 3: Detroit’s visitor scores this season (when Detroit is the visitor)
Minimum visitor score for Detroit as the visitor
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1))::int) AS min_visitor_score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE lower(visitor) = 'detroit';

Result:
- min_visitor_score = 1

List of Detroit-away games with parsed visitor score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, trim(split_part(score, '-', 1))::int AS visitor_score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE lower(visitor) = 'detroit'
ORDER BY date;

Results:
- january 10 | detroit @ boston | 1 - 2 | visitor_score = 1
- january 19 | detroit @ san jose | 1 - 2 | visitor_score = 1
- january 2  | detroit @ carolina | 4 - 1 | visitor_score = 4
- january 21 | detroit @ anaheim | 2 - 2 | visitor_score = 2
- january 22 | detroit @ los angeles | 5 - 4 | visitor_score = 5
- january 24 | detroit @ phoenix | 2 - 5 | visitor_score = 2
- january 26 | detroit @ dallas | 2 - 2 | visitor_score = 2

Step 4: Distribution context (optional check)
Executed SQL:
SELECT (regexp_replace(score, '^\s*([0-9]+).*$','\1'))::int AS visitor_score, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
GROUP BY visitor_score
ORDER BY visitor_score ASC;

Results:
- visitor_score 0: 1 game
- visitor_score 1: 3 games
- visitor_score 2: 5 games
- visitor_score 3: 2 games
- visitor_score 4: 2 games
- visitor_score 5: 1 game
Detroit had visitor_score = 1 in 2 of those 3 games (confirmed by:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS detroit_visitor_score_1 FROM (SELECT lower(visitor) AS visitor, (regexp_replace(score, '^\s*([0-9]+).*$','\1'))::int AS visitor_score FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season) t WHERE visitor = 'detroit' AND visitor_score = 1; → detroit_visitor_score_1 = 2.)

Conclusion
- The lowest visitor score in this season’s dataset is 0 (recorded by Nashville at Detroit).
- Detroit, as the visiting team, did not record the absolute lowest visitor score (0). Their lowest away score was 1, which is the second-lowest value observed this season and occurred in two Detroit away games.
- Therefore, if “one of the lowest” is understood to mean “among the very lowest values observed (0 or 1),” the claim is supported. If it is interpreted strictly as “tied for the lowest,” it is not supported.

Assumptions
- “This season” refers to the season represented by the only available dataset: the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season.
- “Visitor score” is defined as the first number in the score field (visitor goals), which the data format supports.
- Scope is limited to this table; no league-wide comparison across all teams’ seasons is available in the accessible data.
