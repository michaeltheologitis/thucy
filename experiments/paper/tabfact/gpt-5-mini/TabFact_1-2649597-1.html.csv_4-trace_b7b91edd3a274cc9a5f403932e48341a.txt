Claim: "in the year 2000 shane hall dnf half of his race"

Finding: Supported by season-level data for Shane Hall.

Evidence from data
1) Retrieve 2000 season races and DNFs, and compute proportion
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, races, dnf, (CASE WHEN races>0 THEN ROUND(dnf::numeric / races::numeric,4) ELSE NULL END) AS dnf_proportion
FROM public.shane_hall
WHERE year = 2000;

Result:
- year = 2000
- races = 2
- dnf = 1
- dnf_proportion = 0.5000

Interpretation
- In 2000, Shane Hall had 2 races, with 1 DNF, which is exactly 50% of his races. This aligns with the claim that he DNF’d in half of his races that year.

Conclusion
- The data confirms the claim as stated (interpreting "race" to mean "races").

Assumptions
- "race" is interpreted as "races" (plural) and "DNF half" means DNFs accounted for 50% of total races in the 2000 season.
- The public.shane_hall table is treated as the authoritative season summary for Shane Hall for the year 2000.
