Claim to verify: "the toronto blue jay play the angel 3 time in may during the 1991 season"

Data sources discovered and used:
- Database: postgres_tabfact11 (TabFact)
- Table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date [text], opponent [text], score [text], loss [text], attendance [bigint], record [text])

What the data shows:
- The 1991 Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels four times in May: May 24, May 25, May 26, and May 31. This contradicts the claim of three times.
- All games versus the Angels present in this dataset occur in May; the dataset shows four total Angels games in 1991, all in May.

Executed SQL queries and returned results (evidence):
1) Identify May dates vs. Angels and list them
SQL:
SELECT date
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may %' AND lower(opponent) LIKE '%angels%'
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- may 24
- may 25
- may 26
- may 31

2) Count of May games vs. Angels
SQL:
SELECT count(*)
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may %' AND lower(opponent) LIKE '%angels%';
Result:
- count: 4

3) Total games vs. Angels in 1991 (all months in this dataset)
SQL:
SELECT count(*)
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE lower(opponent) LIKE '%angels%';
Result:
- count: 4

4) Month distribution for games vs. Angels
SQL:
SELECT month, games
FROM (
  SELECT split_part(lower(date),' ',1) AS month, count(*) AS games
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE lower(opponent) LIKE '%angels%'
  GROUP BY month
) t
ORDER BY CASE month
  WHEN 'jan' THEN 1 WHEN 'feb' THEN 2 WHEN 'mar' THEN 3 WHEN 'apr' THEN 4 WHEN 'may' THEN 5 WHEN 'jun' THEN 6 WHEN 'jul' THEN 7 WHEN 'aug' THEN 8 WHEN 'sep' THEN 9 WHEN 'oct' THEN 10 WHEN 'nov' THEN 11 WHEN 'dec' THEN 12 ELSE 99 END;
Result:
- month: may, games: 4

Conclusion: The data shows four May games vs the Angels in 1991, not three. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- "angel" is interpreted as the California Angels (opponent stored as "angels").
- Matching was done case-insensitively on both the date’s month token and the opponent name (using lower(...)).
- The date column encodes the month as the first token (e.g., "may 24").
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season is treated as authoritative for the 1991 Blue Jays schedule/results within the accessible data environment.
