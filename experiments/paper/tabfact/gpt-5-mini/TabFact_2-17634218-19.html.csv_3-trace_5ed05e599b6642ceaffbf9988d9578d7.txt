Conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset, the earliest (i.e., “first”) month-year recorded in the column named first is November 1965.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact2, schema public, table public.list_of_sumo_record_holders. Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text). The first and last columns store month-year values as text.

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows to understand first column format
SQL executed:
"SELECT name, total, first, last, \"highest rank\" FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders ORDER BY name LIMIT 20;"
Key returned examples included:
- hasegawa | total: 30 | first: "november 1965" | last: "september 1974" | highest rank: "sekiwake"
- daikirin | total: 22 | first: "november 1966" | last: "september 1970" | highest rank: "ōzeki"
- takamiyama | total: 27 | first: "november 1969" | last: "september 1982" | highest rank: "sekiwake"

2) Find the earliest parsed month-year in first
SQL executed:
"SELECT min(to_date(initcap(trim(first)), 'Month YYYY')) AS min_date FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;"
Result:
- min_date = 1965-11-01 (i.e., November 1965)

3) Retrieve the row(s) that match that earliest date
SQL executed:
"SELECT name, total, first, last, \"highest rank\", to_date(initcap(trim(first)), 'Month YYYY') AS parsed_first FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE to_date(initcap(trim(first)), 'Month YYYY') = DATE '1965-11-01';"
Result:
- name: hasegawa | total: 30 | first: "november 1965" | last: "september 1974" | highest rank: "sekiwake" | parsed_first: 1965-11-01

4) Chronological confirmation of all distinct first values
SQL executed:
"SELECT DISTINCT first, to_date(initcap(trim(first)), 'Month YYYY') AS parsed_date FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders ORDER BY parsed_date;"
Earliest entry shown:
- first: "november 1965" → parsed_date: 1965-11-01
Subsequent entries include: "november 1966", "november 1969", "november 1988", etc.

Assessment
- The data show that the earliest recorded month-year in the first column is November 1965, which matches the claim that “the first record [is] in November 1965.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the first record” to mean the earliest month-year appearing in the first column of public.list_of_sumo_record_holders. The first field stores month-year as text, so I parsed it into a date using to_date(initcap(trim(first)), 'Month YYYY').
