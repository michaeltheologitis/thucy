Summary conclusion
- The power-to-weight figures are supported by the data: VCTP is listed at 24 hp/t (23 hp/ton) and VCA 155 at 18 hp/t (16.5 hp/ton).
- The statement that it is “not 55 km/h (34 mph)” is contradicted by the data source, which lists the VCA 155 top speed as 55 km/h (34 mph).

Data sources consulted
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: tam_tank (columns: vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt — all text)

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Table snapshot to see all rows and context
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
- Key returned rows (abridged to relevant fields):
  • Row 4 (power-to-weight):
    - vctp: 24hp / t (23hp / ton)
    - vca 155: 18hp / t ( 16.5hp / ton)
  • Row 5 (speeds):
    - vca 155: 55 km / h (34 mph)

2) Direct extraction of power-to-weight values (4th row)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT vctp, "vca 155" FROM public.tam_tank OFFSET 3 LIMIT 1;
- Result:
  - VCTP: 24hp / t (23hp / ton)
  - VCA 155: 18hp / t (16.5hp / ton)

3) Direct extraction of speed values (5th row)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT vctp, "vca 155" FROM tam_tank OFFSET 4 LIMIT 1;
- Result:
  - VCA 155: 55 km / h (34 mph)

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “vctp 24hp / t (23hp / ton)” → Supported by Row 4. Verified.
- “vca 155 of 18hp / t (16.5hp / ton)” → Supported by Row 4. Verified.
- “and not 55 km / h (34 mph)” (interpreted as denying that VCA 155 has 55 km/h top speed) → Contradicted by Row 5, which lists 55 km/h (34 mph). Inaccurate.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the statement as referring to the TAM family variants where VCTP and VCA 155 are columns in the tam_tank table.
- Interpreted “and not 55 km/h (34 mph)” as asserting that the VCA 155 does not have a 55 km/h top speed.
- Used the table’s inherent row ordering (OFFSET/LIMIT) to retrieve the 4th (power-to-weight) and 5th (speed) rows, as suggested by the table contents returned by the full SELECT.
