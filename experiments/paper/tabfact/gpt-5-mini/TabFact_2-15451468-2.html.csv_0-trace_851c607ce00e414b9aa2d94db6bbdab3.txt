Claim interpreted: The New Orleans Saints (opponent) were played before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium (per the available NFL schedule data).

What the data shows
- The only relevant dataset available is the 1970 New York Giants season table. It contains game-by-game entries including week number, opponent, and game site.
- This table shows a Week 3 game versus the New Orleans Saints at Tulane Stadium, which is before Week 7.

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Query to find any games at Tulane Stadium:
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance
FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season
WHERE "game site" ILIKE '%Tulane Stadium%'
ORDER BY week;
Result:
- week: 3, date: 1970 - 10 - 04, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 14 - 10, game site: tulane stadium, attendance: 69126

2) Query to list all games against the New Orleans Saints:
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance
FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New Orleans Saints%';
Result:
- week: 3, date: 1970 - 10 - 04, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 14 - 10, game site: tulane stadium, attendance: 69126

3) Query to confirm it occurred before Week 7:
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE week < 7 AND "game site" ILIKE '%Tulane Stadium%';
Result:
- week: 3, date: 1970 - 10 - 04, opponent: new orleans saints, result: l 14 - 10, game site: tulane stadium

Conclusion
- Supported by the available data, the New York Giants played the New Orleans Saints at Tulane Stadium in Week 3 (i.e., before Week 7).

Notes on wording
- The dataset uses "new orleans saints" (plural). The claim's "saint" appears to be a minor naming variation.

Assumptions
- Due to the available data environment, I interpreted the claim within the context of the 1970 New York Giants season table.
- "Play before week 7" is interpreted as a game occurring in Week 1–6.
- "At Tulane Stadium" is matched via the game site field containing "tulane stadium" (case-insensitive).
