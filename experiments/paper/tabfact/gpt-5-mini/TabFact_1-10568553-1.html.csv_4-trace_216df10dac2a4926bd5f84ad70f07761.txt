Claim interpreted: “Anne Street is located in Plymouth County and has no major junctions (no milepost or road intersections).”

Data sources explored
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Available table: public.massachusetts_route_139
  - Columns: county (text), location (text), "street names" (text), milepost (text), "roads intersected" (text), notes (text)

Evidence
1) Locate any entries for “Anne Street”
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected"
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE "street names" ILIKE '%Anne Street%';
Result:
- county: norfolk
- location: weymouth
- street names: anne street
- milepost: (no major junctions)
- roads intersected: (no major junctions)

2) Confirm the county for any “Anne Street” entries
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE "street names" ILIKE '%Anne Street%';
Result:
- norfolk

3) Check for any “Anne” street names specifically within Plymouth County
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names" FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE county = 'Plymouth' AND "street names" ILIKE '%Anne%';
Result:
- No rows returned

4) Check common abbreviation variant (“Anne St”)
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected"
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE "street names" ILIKE '%Anne St%' OR "street names" ILIKE '%Anne St.%';
Result:
- county: norfolk; location: weymouth; street names: anne street; milepost: (no major junctions); roads intersected: (no major junctions)

Assessment of the claim
- Location in Plymouth County: Not supported. The only “Anne Street” entry found for MA Route 139 is in Weymouth, Norfolk County. No entries in Plymouth County match “Anne.”
- “No major junctions” (milepost and roads intersected): Supported. For the “Anne Street” entry, both milepost and roads intersected are recorded as “(no major junctions).”

Conclusion: The claim mixes one incorrect element (county) with a correct element (no major junctions).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Anne Street that appears along Massachusetts Route 139 in the provided dataset.
- The phrase “no major junctions” in the milepost and roads intersected fields indicates the absence of major junctions at that location.
- Case-insensitive substring searches were used for matching street names, including checking a common abbreviation (“St”).
