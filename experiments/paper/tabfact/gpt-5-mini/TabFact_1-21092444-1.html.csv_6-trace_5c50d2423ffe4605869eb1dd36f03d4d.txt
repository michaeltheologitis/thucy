Claim to verify: "the black knight lose to stanford 21 - 10"

What I checked
- The only available authoritative dataset is a table of the 1975 Army Cadets (Black Knights) football season: public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team.
- I searched for the game versus Stanford and retrieved the recorded result and scores.

Evidence from data
- Result found for the Stanford game in the 1975 season table:
  - date: oct 4
  - opponent: stanford
  - result: loss
  - Army Black Knights points: 14
  - opponent points: 67
  - record after the game: 2 - 2

Exact SQL executed
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Stanford%';

Conclusion
- In the available data (1975 season), Army lost to Stanford 67–14, not 21–10. Therefore, the specific score claimed is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The accessible dataset only contains the 1975 Army season. I interpret the claim in the context of this available season data, as no other seasons or related tables are present to check additional years.
