Claim interpreted: “The grid number for the entry with 104 laps and a time/retired of ‘+ 6.18’ is 1.”

Data source explored
- Available DB: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix with columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence and queries
1) Verify that any row has laps = 104
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT laps FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix ORDER BY laps ASC;
- Result (distinct laps): 5, 7, 9, 18, 21, 40, 41, 43, 47, 58, 76, 95, 96, 101, 102, 105 (104 is not present)

- SQL (direct check):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE laps = 104;
- Result: count = 0 (no rows with laps = 104)

2) Locate any row with time / retired containing “+ 6.18” and inspect laps and grid
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired", grid
  FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix
  WHERE "time / retired" LIKE '%+ 6.18%';
- Result:
  • driver: richie ginther; laps: 105; time / retired: + 6.18; grid: 5

3) Confirm no row simultaneously satisfies laps = 104 and time / retired = ‘+ 6.18’
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, "time / retired", grid
  FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix
  WHERE laps = 104
  ORDER BY driver;
- Result: No rows returned (since laps = 104 does not exist at all)

Conclusion
- There is no entry with 104 laps in this table.
- The only entry with time/retired “+ 6.18” has 105 laps and grid = 5, not 1.
- Therefore, the claim that the grid number is 1 for an entry with 104 laps and time/retired ‘+ 6.18’ is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the table public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix and its columns exactly as named (“laps”, “time / retired”, “grid”).
- The substring match for “+ 6.18” is taken literally (plus sign, space, 6.18).
