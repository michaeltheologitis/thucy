Claim to verify: “the combined run on september 1 be the lowest of any game that month.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season(date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

What I checked
- Interpreted the claim against the only available season/game-log table (1997 Toronto Blue Jays). Computed combined runs (sum of both teams’ runs parsed from the score) for all September games in that table and compared September 1 to the minimum for the month.

Evidence and exact SQL used
1) Compute combined runs for all September games and list from lowest to highest
SQL:
SELECT date,
       score,
       CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) AS home_runs,
       CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 1)) AS INTEGER) AS away_runs,
       (CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) +
        CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 1)) AS INTEGER)) AS combined_runs
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%september%'
ORDER BY combined_runs ASC, date;
Key results (date | score | combined_runs):
- september 9 | 2 - 0         | 2
- september 1 | 3 - 0         | 3
- september 19 | 3 - 0        | 3
- september 26 | 3 - 0        | 3
- september 6 | 2 - 1         | 3
… (higher totals continue)

2) Minimum combined runs among September games
SQL:
SELECT MIN(CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) +
               CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 1)) AS INTEGER)) AS min_combined_runs
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%september%';
Result:
- min_combined_runs = 2

3) Combined runs on September 1
SQL:
SELECT date,
       (CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 2)) AS INTEGER) +
        CAST(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(SPLIT_PART(score, '(', 1), '-', 1)) AS INTEGER)) AS combined_runs
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date = 'september 1';
Result:
- september 1 combined_runs = 3

Conclusion
- The lowest combined runs in September (2 runs on september 9, score 2 - 0) is less than the combined runs on september 1 (3 runs, score 3 - 0). Therefore, the combined runs on September 1 were not the lowest of the month in this dataset.

Assumptions made
- The claim pertains to the only available season/game-log table (1997 Toronto Blue Jays) and to September 1997 within it.
- Combined runs = sum of the two numbers in the score; any extra-innings notation in parentheses (e.g., “(11)”) is ignored for parsing.
- The date values are stored in lowercase (e.g., “september 1”), so filtering used ILIKE on “%september%”.
