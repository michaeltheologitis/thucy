Summary
- Claim interpreted: There exists a screening record that started on March 29, 2006 and was completed on May 3, 2006.
- Finding: No record in the authoritative data source matches those exact dates. The closest record shows screening started on 27 March 2006 and completed on 5 May 2006.

Data sources checked
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact9 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table with columns:
  - "screening started" (text)
  - "screening completed" (text)
  - "chapter unfrozen" (text)
  - "chapter opened" (text)
  - "chapter closed" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full scan of relevant columns
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed"
FROM public.my_info_table;
Result (excerpt relevant to 2006):
[ {"screening completed":"22 december 2005","screening started":"25 november 2005"},
  {"screening completed":"3 march 2006","screening started":"6 february 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"28 april 2006","screening started":"9 march 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"23 march 2006","screening started":"16 february 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"22 march 2006","screening started":"8 february 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"5 may 2006","screening started":"27 march 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"2 june 2006","screening started":"3 april 2006"},
  {"screening completed":"30 june 2006","screening started":"18 may 2006"},
  ... ]
Observation: No row shows started = 29 March 2006 and completed = 3 May 2006.

2) Exact text match for the pair (case-sensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening started" = '29 March 2006'
  AND "screening completed" = '3 May 2006';
Result:
match_count = 0

3) Exact text match for the pair (case-insensitive, trimmed)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE trim(lower("screening started")) = lower('29 March 2006')
  AND trim(lower("screening completed")) = lower('3 May 2006');
Result:
match_count = 0

4) Individual date checks (case-insensitive) to see if either date appears at all
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE trim(lower("screening started")) = lower('29 March 2006');
Result: cnt = 0

SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE trim(lower("screening completed")) = lower('3 May 2006');
Result: cnt = 0

5) Loose pattern searches (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening started" ILIKE '%29%march%2006%';
Result: cnt = 0

SQL executed:
SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" ILIKE '%3%may%2006%';
Result: cnt = 0

6) Nearest match (±3 days window around the claimed dates, parsing text as DD Month YYYY)
SQL executed:
SELECT "screening started", "screening completed"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "screening started" ~ '^[0-9]{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$'
  AND "screening completed" ~ '^[0-9]{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}$'
  AND to_date("screening started", 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '2006-03-26' AND DATE '2006-04-01'
  AND to_date("screening completed", 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '2006-04-30' AND DATE '2006-05-06';
Result:
[{"screening completed":"5 may 2006","screening started":"27 march 2006"}]
Observation: The closest record differs by two days earlier for start and two days later for completion compared with the claim.

Conclusion
- The database contains no record with screening started on March 29, 2006 and screening completed on May 3, 2006. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the fields "screening started" and "screening completed" in the authoritative table public.my_info_table.
- Dates are stored as English text in the format "DD Month YYYY" (case-insensitive). Variants like "May 3rd, 2006" would be normalized conceptually to "3 May 2006" for matching.
- If the claim intended approximate dates rather than exact, the nearest match is: started 27 March 2006 and completed 5 May 2006 (shown above).
