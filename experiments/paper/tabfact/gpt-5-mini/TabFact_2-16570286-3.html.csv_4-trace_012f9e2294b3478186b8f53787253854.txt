Scope and data discovery
- Discovered data source: postgres_tabfact32 (TabFact), public schema. Only one table available: t_1948_ashes_series.
- Table schema (public.t_1948_ashes_series):
  - player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the England player with the best (lowest) bowling average in the available dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, average FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england' ORDER BY average ASC LIMIT 1;
- Result: [{"player":"norman yardley","average":22.66}]
- Finding: Norman Yardley has the best (lowest) bowling average among England players in this dataset.

2) Retrieve Alec Bedser’s bowling average from the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, average FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player = 'alec bedser';
- Result: [{"player":"alec bedser","average":38.22}]
- Finding: Alec Bedser’s bowling average in this dataset is 38.22, which is not the best among England players in the table.

3) Full ranking of England players by bowling average (for context)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, average FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE team = 'england' ORDER BY average ASC;
- Result: [
  {"player":"norman yardley","average":22.66},
  {"player":"alec bedser","average":38.22},
  {"player":"jim laker","average":52.44}
]
- Finding: Alec Bedser ranks behind Norman Yardley by bowling average in this dataset.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data (1948 Ashes series table), the claim is not supported: Alec Bedser does not have the best bowling average among England players in this dataset; Norman Yardley does.

Assumptions
- Because only a single table (t_1948_ashes_series) is available, the verification is constrained to that dataset, which appears to cover the 1948 Ashes series. “Best bowling average of any England player” is interpreted within this dataset’s scope (i.e., among England players included in this table).
