Claim to verify: “Keith Gordon wrote 2 episodes of Dexter in Season 3.”

Step 1 — Explore available data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table relevant to this claim: dexter_season_3 (episode-level data for Dexter Season 3, including “directed by” and “written by”).

Schema summary (from tool):
- Table: dexter_season_3
  - Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text)

Step 2 — Evidence collection via executed SQL

A) Did Keith Gordon write any Season 3 episodes?
- Query (executed):
  SELECT count(*) AS ct FROM dexter_season_3 WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%';
  Result: {"ct": 0}

- Query (executed):
  SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by" 
  FROM dexter_season_3 
  WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%'
  ORDER BY "no in season";
  Result: no rows (no matching episodes)

Finding: The data shows zero episodes in Season 3 with Keith Gordon listed as the writer.

B) Context check — Did Keith Gordon direct episodes instead?
- Query (executed):
  SELECT "no in season", title, "directed by" 
  FROM dexter_season_3 
  WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%'
  ORDER BY "no in season";
  Result:
  - No in season 1 — "our father" — directed by: keith gordon
  - No in season 4 — "all in the family" — directed by: keith gordon

- Count query (executed):
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM dexter_season_3 
  WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Keith Gordon%';
  Result: 2

Finding: The data shows Keith Gordon directed two Season 3 episodes, which may be the source of confusion, but he is not credited as writer in this table.

C) Full Season 3 writing credits (for completeness)
- Query (executed):
  SELECT "no in season", title, "written by", "directed by" 
  FROM dexter_season_3
  ORDER BY "no in season" ASC;
  Results (abbrev.):
  1) our father — written by: clyde phillips — directed by: keith gordon
  2) finding freebo — written by: melissa rosenberg — directed by: marcos siega
  3) the lion sleeps tonight — written by: scott buck — directed by: john dahl
  4) all in the family — written by: adam e fierro — directed by: keith gordon
  5) turning biminese — written by: tim schlattmann — directed by: marcos siega
  6) sái se puede — written by: charles h eglee — directed by: ernest dickerson
  7) easy as pie — written by: lauren gussis — directed by: steve shill
  8) the damage a man can do — written by: scott buck — directed by: marcos siega
  10) go your own way — written by: tim schlattmann — directed by: john dahl
  11) i had a dream — written by: charles h eglee and lauren gussis — directed by: marcos siega

Additional table checks:
- Query (executed): SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM dexter_season_3; Result: 10
- Query (executed): SELECT "no in season" FROM dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season"; Result: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,11

Conclusion based on data
- The database shows Keith Gordon wrote 0 episodes of Dexter Season 3. He did direct 2 episodes (Our Father and All in the Family). Therefore, the claim that “Keith Gordon wrote 2 episodes of Dexter in Season 3” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “write 2 episode” as “has writer credit on two episodes” and searched the "written by" column case-insensitively for “Keith Gordon”.
- Relied on the dexter_season_3 table as the authoritative source for Season 3 credits, per the instruction to treat accessible data as reliable and authoritative.
