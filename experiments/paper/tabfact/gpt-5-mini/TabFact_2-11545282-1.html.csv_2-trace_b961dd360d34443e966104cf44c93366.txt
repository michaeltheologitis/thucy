Claim to verify: "after 2000 england , the united state , brazil , and puerto rico each contribute 1 player"

Data source explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster with columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team

Quick look at the data (to understand formats)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster LIMIT 40;
Key rows returned (9 total rows in table):
- john amaechi | england | 2001 - 03
- louis amundson | united states | 2007
- rafael araãjo | brazil | 2006 - 2007
- carlos arroyo | puerto rico | 2002 - 05
... (plus U.S. players from pre-2000 spans)

Core check: Count players after 2000 by nationality (England, United States, Brazil, Puerto Rico)
Method: Parse the textual year span into start_year and end_year, handling formats "YYYY", "YYYY - YY" (with century logic), and "YYYY - YYYY". Count distinct players whose end_year > 2000.

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT lower(nationality) as nationality,
       COUNT(DISTINCT player) as cnt
FROM (
  SELECT player, nationality,
    trim("years for jazz") as y,
    CASE 
      WHEN trim("years for jazz") ~ '^\d{4}$' THEN CAST(trim("years for jazz") AS int)
      WHEN trim("years for jazz") ~ '^\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{2,4}$' THEN CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',1),'\s','', 'g') AS int)
      ELSE NULL END as start_year,
    CASE
      WHEN trim("years for jazz") ~ '^\d{4}$' THEN CAST(trim("years for jazz") AS int)
      WHEN trim("years for jazz") ~ '^\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{2,4}$' THEN
         (CASE WHEN length(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',2),'\s','', 'g'))=2 THEN
            ((CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',1),'\s','', 'g') AS int)
               - (CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',1),'\s','', 'g') AS int) % 100)
              )
              + (CASE WHEN CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',2),'\s','', 'g') AS int)
                         < (CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',1),'\s','', 'g') AS int) % 100)
                      THEN 100 ELSE 0 END)
              + CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',2),'\s','', 'g') AS int)
            )
          ELSE CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(trim("years for jazz"),'-',2),'\s','', 'g') AS int) END)
      ELSE NULL END as end_year
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE lower(nationality) IN ('england','united states','brazil','puerto rico')
) sub
WHERE end_year IS NOT NULL AND end_year > 2000
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY nationality;

Results:
- brazil: 1
- england: 1
- puerto rico: 1
- united states: 1

Supporting detail: Which players are counted (with parsed years)
Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT player, nationality, years_for_jazz, start_year, end_year
FROM (
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz" AS years_for_jazz,
    CASE
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*$' THEN CAST(trim("years for jazz") AS integer)
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{2}\s*$' THEN CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '^\s*(\d{4})') AS integer)
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{4}\s*$' THEN CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '^\s*(\d{4})') AS integer)
      ELSE NULL
    END AS start_year,
    CASE
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*$' THEN CAST(trim("years for jazz") AS integer)
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{2}\s*$' THEN (
        (CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '^\s*(\d{4})') AS integer) - (CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '^\s*(\d{4})') AS integer) % 100))
        + CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '-\s*(\d{2})\s*$') AS integer)

      )
      WHEN "years for jazz" ~ '^\s*\d{4}\s*-\s*\d{4}\s*$' THEN CAST(substring("years for jazz" from '-\s*(\d{4})\s*$') AS integer)
      ELSE NULL
    END AS end_year
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE lower(nationality) IN ('england','united states','brazil','puerto rico')
) t
WHERE end_year > 2000
ORDER BY end_year, start_year;

Returned rows:
- john amaechi | england | 2001 - 03 | 2001 | 2003
- carlos arroyo | puerto rico | 2002 - 05 | 2002 | 2005
- rafael araãjo | brazil | 2006 - 2007 | 2006 | 2007
- louis amundson | united states | 2007 | 2007 | 2007

Conclusion
- The data show that after 2000, each of the specified nationalities—England, United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico—contributed exactly 1 player to the Utah Jazz (within the available roster table). Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence from this dataset.

Assumptions
- "After 2000" interpreted as any player whose parsed Jazz tenure extends into 2001 or later (end_year > 2000).
- The claim was grounded in the available table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster; thus, the scope of verification is limited to this dataset.
- Nationalities were matched exactly in lowercase to: 'england', 'united states', 'brazil', 'puerto rico'. Minor typographical differences in the claim (e.g., "the united state") were mapped to the data's 'united states'.
