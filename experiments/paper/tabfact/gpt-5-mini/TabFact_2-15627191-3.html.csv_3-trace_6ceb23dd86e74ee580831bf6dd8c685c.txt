Claim to verify: “Neither the 2010 nor the 2011 Kids' Choice Award nominate Cole Sprouse for the Favorite TV Actor category.”

Data source exploration:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact1 (TabFact), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.the_suite_life_on_deck with columns: year, award, category, recipient, result

Step 1: Confirm that the table contains Kids’ Choice Awards entries and the “favorite tv actor” category for 2010 and 2011.
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT award, category FROM public.the_suite_life_on_deck ORDER BY award, category;
Key results (subset relevant to this claim):
- award: 2010 kids' choice awards | category: favorite tv actor
- award: 2011 kids' choice awards | category: favorite tv actor

Step 2: Retrieve the recipients and outcomes for the Favorite TV Actor category in 2010 and 2011.
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, recipient, result
FROM public.the_suite_life_on_deck
WHERE year IN (2010,2011)
  AND lower(category) LIKE '%favorite tv actor%'
ORDER BY year, recipient;
Results:
2010 Kids' Choice Awards — Favorite TV Actor
- Cole Sprouse — nominated
- Dylan Sprouse — won

2011 Kids' Choice Awards — Favorite TV Actor
- Cole Sprouse — nominated
- Dylan Sprouse — won

Conclusion:
- The data shows Cole Sprouse was nominated for Favorite TV Actor in both 2010 and 2011 Kids’ Choice Awards. This directly contradicts the claim that he was not nominated in either year.

Assumptions:
- The “award” values labeled “2010 kids’ choice awards” and “2011 kids’ choice awards” refer to Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards for those years.
- The “result” value “nominated” indicates being an official nominee for the category.
