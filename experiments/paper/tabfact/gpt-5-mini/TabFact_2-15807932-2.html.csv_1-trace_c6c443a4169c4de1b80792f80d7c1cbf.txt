Claim: "south korea earn no gold medal in the competition."

Data source exploration:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact6 (TabFact), public schema.
- Relevant table: t_1967_world_judo_championships (columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total).

Evidence:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE nation ILIKE '%korea%';

- Result:
  { rank: 3, nation: "south korea", gold: 0, silver: 1, bronze: 2, total: 3 }

Analysis:
- The row for South Korea in the 1967 World Judo Championships shows gold = 0. Therefore, within this competition, South Korea earned no gold medals.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the available competition table.

Assumptions:
- "the competition" refers to the 1967 World Judo Championships (the only competition dataset available in the connected data source).
- Nation matching used a case-insensitive search for "korea" to ensure we captured the South Korea entry, which appears as "south korea" in the table.
