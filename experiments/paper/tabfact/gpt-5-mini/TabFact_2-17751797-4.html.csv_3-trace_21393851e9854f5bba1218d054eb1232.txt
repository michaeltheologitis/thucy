Claim interpreted: The score was 1 - 0 when the home team was Shrewsbury Town (within the available FA Cup 1990–91 dataset).

Data sources explored
- Available relational source: postgres_tabfact12 (TabFact public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup with columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date".

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve all matches with home team = Shrewsbury Town (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", "score", "date", "tie no" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'Shrewsbury Town';
Result:
- home team: shrewsbury town; away team: wimbledon; score: 1 - 0; date: 26 / 01 / 1991; tie no: 6

2) Count such matches (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'Shrewsbury Town';
Result:
- match_count = 1

3) Distinct score values for those matches (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "score" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'Shrewsbury Town' ORDER BY "score";
Result:
- 1 - 0

Conclusion
- The dataset shows one match where the home team is Shrewsbury Town, and its score is 1 - 0. This supports the claim as stated in the context of the available data.

Assumptions
- Context is the 1990–91 FA Cup dataset represented by public.t_1990_91_fa_cup.
- Team name matching is case-insensitive but otherwise exact (no partial matches).
