Claim: “there be a 74.64 point difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (112.28).”

What I checked
- Computed the maximum and minimum of the two provided scores and their difference using SQL literals (no tables).
- Verified whether the computed difference equals 74.64.

Evidence and executed SQL
- Query result (single row): max_score = 186.92; min_score = 112.28; difference = 74.64; equals_74_64 = true
- Executed SQL:
SELECT 
  greatest(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric) AS max_score,
  least(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric) AS min_score,
  (greatest(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric) - least(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric)) AS difference,
  ((greatest(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric) - least(186.92::numeric, 112.28::numeric)) = 74.64::numeric) AS equals_74_64;

Conclusion
- The computed difference between 186.92 and 112.28 is 74.64, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “Highest score” refers to 186.92 and “lowest score” refers to 112.28 as given, with no other context required.
- Exact numeric arithmetic (numeric type) reflects the intended precision of the values.
