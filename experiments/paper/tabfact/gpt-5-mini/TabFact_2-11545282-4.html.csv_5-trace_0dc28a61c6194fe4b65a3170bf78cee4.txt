Claim to verify: “the jazz have 2 player , both guard , with the last name dawkins but their time on the team do not overlap.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster

Schema details used
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence
1) Identify all Jazz players with last name “Dawkins,” and retrieve their positions and Jazz tenures
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%dawkins%';
- Result rows (player — position — years for jazz):
  - darryl dawkins — center — 1987 - 88
  - paul dawkins — guard — 1979 - 80

Assessment of claim components
- “the jazz have 2 player … with the last name dawkins” — Supported. Two players are listed: Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins.
- “both guard” — Contradicted. Paul Dawkins is listed as a guard, but Darryl Dawkins is listed as a center.
- “their time on the team do not overlap” — Supported. Paul Dawkins: 1979–80; Darryl Dawkins: 1987–88. These seasons do not overlap.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes true and false elements: there are indeed two Dawkins on the Jazz and their tenures do not overlap, but they are not both guards (one is a center).

Assumptions
- “the jazz” refers to the Utah Jazz franchise as represented by the utah_jazz_all_time_roster table.
- Player positions and tenure ranges are taken as-is from the position and years for jazz columns.
- Last name matching used a case-insensitive substring search (ILIKE '%dawkins%').
