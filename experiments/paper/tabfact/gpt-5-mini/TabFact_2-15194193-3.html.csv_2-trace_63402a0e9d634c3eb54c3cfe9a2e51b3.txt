Summary conclusion
- The data show Alberto Pagani recorded a total of 2 wins in 1971, and no other year has 2 (or more) wins. Therefore, 1971 is the only year in which he won twice in the same year.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.alberto_pagani

Schema details (from tool)
- public.alberto_pagani columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)

Evidence 1: Full per-year, per-class/team rows
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, class, team, points, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani ORDER BY year ASC;
- Key results (wins > 0 years):
  • 1969 — class 500cc (linto): wins = 1
  • 1971 — class 500cc (linto): wins = 1; class 500cc (mv agusta): wins = 1 (total across 1971 = 2)
  • 1972 — class 500cc (mv agusta): wins = 1
- All other rows show wins = 0

Evidence 2: Aggregated wins by year
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, SUM(wins) AS total_wins,
         array_agg(DISTINCT class) AS classes,
         array_agg(DISTINCT team) AS teams
  FROM public.alberto_pagani
  GROUP BY year
  ORDER BY year;
- Results (year | total_wins):
  • 1959 | 0
  • 1960 | 0
  • 1961 | 0
  • 1962 | 0
  • 1963 | 0
  • 1964 | 0
  • 1965 | 0
  • 1966 | 0
  • 1967 | 0
  • 1968 | 0
  • 1969 | 1
  • 1970 | 0
  • 1971 | 2
  • 1972 | 1

Conclusion
- Only the year 1971 sums to 2 wins; all other years are 0 or 1. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The table public.alberto_pagani comprehensively reflects Alberto Pagani’s Grand Prix results by year/class/team, and wins can be summed per year to represent total annual wins.
