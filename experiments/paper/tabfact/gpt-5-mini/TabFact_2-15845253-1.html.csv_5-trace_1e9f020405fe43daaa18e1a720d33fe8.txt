Claim to verify: “9 of the viral disease replicate in the nucleus.”

Data source explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact18
- Schema: public
- Table: viral_disease (columns: family, baltimore group, envelopment, virion shape, replication site)

Evidence gathered:
1) Count of entries that replicate in the nucleus
- Result: 9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS nucleus_count FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" ILIKE '%nucleus%';

2) Distinct values and counts for the replication site column
- Results:
  - cytoplasm: 14
  - nucleus: 9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "replication site", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM viral_disease GROUP BY "replication site" ORDER BY cnt DESC;

3) Total number of rows in the table (for context)
- Result: 23
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM viral_disease;

Conclusion:
- The data show exactly 9 rows in viral_disease with replication site containing “nucleus,” and the distinct value breakdown confirms 9 entries labeled “nucleus.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the number of entries (viral diseases) in the available viral_disease table whose replication site is the nucleus. Matching was performed case-insensitively using ILIKE '%nucleus%'.
