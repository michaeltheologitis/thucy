Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: t_2002_u_s_open_golf(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text)

Evidence from data:
- The table entry for Tiger Woods in the 2002 U.S. Open golf dataset shows his score as “67 + 68 + 70 = 205” with “to par” = “- 5”. This indicates a 54-hole total of 205.

Executed SQL (supporting evidence):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Tiger Woods%';

Result:
- place: 1
- player: tiger woods
- country: united states
- score: 67 + 68 + 70 = 205
- to par: - 5

Conclusion:
- The claim that “tiger wood score be 205” is supported by the available data for the 2002 U.S. Open (54-hole total shown in this table).

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referencing the 2002 U.S. Open golf data in the accessible TabFact database, where the listed score reflects the 54-hole total, not the final 72-hole tournament score.
