Claim interpreted: “Tyler Farrar was the winner of Stage 3.”

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact10 (TabFact), schema public
  - Table: t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a with columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), "general classification" (text), "points classification" (text), "mountains classification" (text), "combination classification" (text), "team classification" (text)

Evidence
1) Who won Stage 3?
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, winner FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE stage = 3;
Result:
- Stage 3 — winner: philippe gilbert

2) Did Tyler Farrar win any stages in this race?
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, winner FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE winner ILIKE '%Tyler Farrar%' ORDER BY stage;
Results:
- stage: 5, winner: tyler farrar
- stage: 21, winner: tyler farrar

Conclusion
- The data shows Philippe Gilbert won Stage 3 of the 2010 Vuelta a España, not Tyler Farrar. Tyler Farrar won Stages 5 and 21. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Because the only available dataset concerns the 2010 Vuelta a España, I interpret the claim as referring to Stage 3 of the 2010 Vuelta a España.
