Conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset for the TV series "Cities of the Underworld," episode number 202 has the original airdate of "february 4 , 2008."

Evidence from data:
- Table: public.cities_of_the_underworld
- Matching row shows: episode no = 202, original airdate = "february 4 , 2008", episode title = "vietnam", production no = 16.
- A count query confirms exactly one row with episode no = 202.

Executed SQL and results:
1) Preview to understand table contents
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld LIMIT 10;
Key returned rows (subset):
- Row 2: "production no": 16, "episode no": 202, "original airdate": "february 4 , 2008", "episode title": "vietnam", "host": "don wildman"

2) Targeted lookup of episode 202
SQL:
