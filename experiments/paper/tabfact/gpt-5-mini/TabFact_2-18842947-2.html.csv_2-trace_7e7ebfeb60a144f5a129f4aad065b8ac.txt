Conclusion: Verified (in the 1976 NFL season covered by the available data). The Detroit Lions lost both of their matchups against the Minnesota Vikings, meaning the Vikings defeated the Lions in both games that season.

Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact16, Schema: public
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Evidence:
1) List of 1976 games vs. Minnesota Vikings and their outcomes
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Minnesota Vikings%';
- Results:
  • Week 3 — date: september 26 , 1976 — opponent: minnesota vikings — result: l 10 - 9
  • Week 9 — date: november 7 , 1976 — opponent: minnesota vikings — result: l 31 - 23

2) Count of games vs. Vikings in 1976 (to confirm there were exactly two)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Vikings%';
- Result:
  • count: 2

3) Sanity check on result semantics (that 'l' indicates a Lions loss, hence a Vikings win in those matchups)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE result ILIKE 'w%' ORDER BY week LIMIT 5;
- Sample Results (confirming 'w' denotes a Lions win):
  • 2 | atlanta falcons | w 24 - 10
  • 5 | new england patriots | w 30 - 10
  • 7 | seattle seahawks | w 41 - 14
  • 8 | green bay packers | w 27 - 6
  • 11 | chicago bears | w 14 - 10
These rows demonstrate the table uses 'w' for Lions wins and, by contrast, 'l' for Lions losses. Therefore, the two Vikings games marked with 'l' are Lions losses and Vikings wins.

Assessment:
- The Detroit Lions played the Minnesota Vikings twice in 1976 and lost both games (10–9 and 31–23). This supports the claim that the Minnesota Vikings defeated the Lions in both games they played (in that season).

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the two divisional matchups in a single NFL season. The only accessible data source covers the Detroit Lions’ 1976 season; thus, verification is specific to 1976.
- Opponent matching used case-insensitive searches on the opponent field (ILIKE).
