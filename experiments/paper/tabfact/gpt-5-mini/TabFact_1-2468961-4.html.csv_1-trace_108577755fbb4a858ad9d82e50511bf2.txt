Summary
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (public schema) containing a table named list_of_step_by_step_episodes, which appears to catalog episodes of the TV series “Step by Step”.
- Relevant schema fields: “no in series” (overall episode number) and “title” (episode title).

Schema evidence
- Table: public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
- Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Evidence query 1 (title lookup)
- SQL: SELECT "title" FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 56;
- Result: title = sister act

Evidence query 2 (full row for context)
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes WHERE "no in series" = 56;
- Result:
  - no in series: 56
  - no in season: 10
  - title: sister act
  - directed by: patrick duffy
  - written by: rj colleary
  - original air date: november 26 , 1993
  - production code: 455461

Assessment
- The data shows that the overall 56th episode has the title “sister act”. This matches the claim exactly.

Assumptions
- “The series” refers to the series represented by the available table (Step by Step).
- “56th episode in the series” corresponds to overall episode number = 56 (column “no in series”).
