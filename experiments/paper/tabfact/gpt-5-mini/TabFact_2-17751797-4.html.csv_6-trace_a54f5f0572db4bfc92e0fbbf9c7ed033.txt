Claim interpreted: “2 - 3 be the score when the home team be Liverpool after 30/01/1991.” Interpreted as: After 30 Jan 1991, any match where Liverpool were the home team had a final score of 2–3.

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact) database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup with columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text).

Key evidence from the data
1) List all FA Cup 1990–91 rows involving Liverpool (to see available matches and date format)
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Liverpool%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Liverpool%' 
ORDER BY "date" ASC;
Result:
- home team: liverpool | score: 2 - 2 | away team: brighton & hove albion | date: 26 / 01 / 1991
- home team: brighton & hove albion | score: 2 - 3 | away team: liverpool | date: 30 / 01 / 1991
Observation: Only two Liverpool matches are in this table. The only 2–3 scoreline has Liverpool as the away team on 30/01/1991, not after, and not at home.

2) Check explicitly for any home=Liverpool matches after 1991-01-30
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower("home team") LIKE '%liverpool%'
  AND to_date(translate("date", ' ', ''), 'DD/MM/YYYY') > DATE '1991-01-30';
Result:
- cnt = 0
Interpretation: No matches where Liverpool were the home team after 30 Jan 1991 in this dataset.

3) Check for a home=Liverpool match with score exactly '2 - 3' after 30/01/1991
SQL executed:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower("home team") = 'liverpool'
  AND "score" = '2 - 3'
  AND to_date(replace("date", ' ', ''), 'DD/MM/YYYY') > to_date('30/01/1991', 'DD/MM/YYYY');
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion based on the data
- In the 1990–91 FA Cup table, there are no matches after 30/01/1991 where Liverpool were the home team, and there is no instance of a home Liverpool match with a 2–3 scoreline after that date. The only 2–3 involving Liverpool is on 30/01/1991 with Liverpool away at Brighton & Hove Albion.

Verdict: The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- “After 30/01/1991” interpreted as strictly later than 30 January 1991.
- “Home team be Liverpool” matched case-insensitively to handle the table’s lowercase 'liverpool'.
- Verification limited to the 1990–91 FA Cup dataset available in postgres_tabfact15/public.t_1990_91_fa_cup.
