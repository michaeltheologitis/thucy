- Scope of available data: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a. This table contains per-stage information for the 2010 Vuelta a España, including the leader of the team classification after each stage.
- Interpreted claim: “caisse d'epargne have the most team classification win with 11.” Within the available dataset, this is taken to mean: across the stages of the 2010 Vuelta a España, Caisse d’Epargne led the team classification on the most stages, with 11 stage leads.

Data source and schema
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
- Columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), general classification (text), points classification (text), mountains classification (text), combination classification (text), team classification (text)

Evidence
1) Count of stages led in the team classification by team (descending)
SQL executed:
SELECT "team classification" AS team, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
WHERE "team classification" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("team classification") <> ''
GROUP BY "team classification"
ORDER BY cnt DESC, team;

Result:
- caisse d'epargne — 11
- team katusha — 7
- team htc - columbia — 3

2) Top count among all teams
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(cnt) AS top_count FROM (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  WHERE "team classification" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("team classification") <> ''
  GROUP BY "team classification"
) sub;

Result:
- top_count = 11

3) Specific check for Caisse d’Epargne’s count (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS caisse_count
FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
WHERE LOWER("team classification") = 'caisse d''epargne';

Result:
- caisse_count = 11

Conclusion
- In the 2010 Vuelta a España dataset, Caisse d’Epargne led the team classification on 11 stages, the highest total among teams. This directly supports the claim within the scope of the available data.
