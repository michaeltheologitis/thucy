Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table used: public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (columns: year bigint, record text, seed bigint, region text, results text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List of all years and records (to see 2012 and 2013 in context)
SQL:
SELECT year, record FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball ORDER BY year ASC;
Key results:
- 2011 | 28 - 12
- 2012 | 29 - 7
- 2013 | 27 - 9

2) Parse record into wins and losses for each row
SQL:
SELECT year, record, CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '-', 1) AS INTEGER) AS wins, CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS losses FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball ORDER BY year ASC;
Key results (subset):
- 2007 | 28 - 7  | wins=28 | losses=7
- 2011 | 28 - 12 | wins=28 | losses=12
- 2012 | 29 - 7  | wins=29 | losses=7
- 2013 | 27 - 9  | wins=27 | losses=9

3) Identify the year(s) with the maximum number of wins
SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT year, record, CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '-', 1) AS INTEGER) AS wins
  FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
)
SELECT year, record, wins FROM parsed WHERE wins = (SELECT MAX(wins) FROM parsed) ORDER BY year;
Result:
- 2012 | 29 - 7 | wins=29
Interpretation: 2012 is the only year with 29 wins, the maximum in the table.

4) Directly confirm 2012 and 2013 records
SQL:
SELECT year, record, CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '-', 1) AS INTEGER) AS wins, CAST(split_part(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS losses FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year IN (2012, 2013) ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2012 | 29 - 7 | wins=29 | losses=7
- 2013 | 27 - 9 | wins=27 | losses=9

Conclusion
- The data show that 2012 has the best season record in this table with 29 wins and 7 losses.
- The 2013 season record is 27 wins and 9 losses.
Both parts of the claim are supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Highest score” is interpreted as the most wins in the season “record” field (W-L).
- “2013 follow with 27 - 9” is interpreted as stating the 2013 season record, not implying it is the second-best record overall.
