Claim to verify:
- Construction was completed in 1993 on the Flowood site, and in 1997 on the Newsome Brothers / old Reichhold Chemical project.

Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  - Columns: cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted (all text)

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Flowood site
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "construction completed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE name ILIKE '%Flowood%';
- Result:
  name = "flowood site"; construction completed = "09 / 17 / 1993"
- Interpretation: Construction completion date is September 17, 1993 → supports "in 1993".

2) Newsome Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemical project
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "construction completed" FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE name ILIKE '%Newsome%' OR name ILIKE '%Reichhold%';
- Result:
  name = "newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc"; construction completed = "08 / 08 / 1997"
- Interpretation: Construction completion date is August 8, 1997 → supports "in 1997". Note minor name variations ("newsom" vs. "newsome"; "chemicals, inc").

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are supported by the table of Superfund sites in Mississippi: Flowood site completed in 1993, and Newsom(e) Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals completed in 1997.

Assumptions:
- "Flowood site" refers to the row labeled "flowood site" in the table.
- "Newsome brother / old reichold chemical project" refers to the row labeled "newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc"; spelling and formatting differences were treated as equivalent for matching.
