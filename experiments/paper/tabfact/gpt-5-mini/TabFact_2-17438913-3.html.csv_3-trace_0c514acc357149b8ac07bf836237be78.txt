Claim to verify: “chris burke , be the only player to have a free transfer fee.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee)

Step 1: Inspect all rows to understand transfer fee values
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
Key returned rows (subset relevant to fees):
- valenciennes | jean - claude darcheville | fra | free | winter | transfer
- cardiff city | chris burke | sco | free | winter | transfer
(Other rows show fees like “n / a”, numeric amounts, loans, etc.)

Step 2: Find all entries where the transfer fee contains “free”
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%';
Returned rows:
- valenciennes | jean - claude darcheville | fra | free | winter | transfer
- cardiff city | chris burke | sco | free | winter | transfer

Step 3: Count distinct players with a “free” transfer fee and list them
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%';
Result: 2

Executed SQL (names):
SELECT DISTINCT name FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%' ORDER BY name;
Result:
- chris burke
- jean - claude darcheville

Findings:
- Chris Burke does have a transfer listed with a fee marked as “free”.
- He is not the only player in this dataset with a free transfer fee; Jean-Claude Darcheville also has a “free” fee entry.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Chris Burke is the only player to have a free transfer fee is contradicted by the data in the available table.

Assumptions made:
- The claim is evaluated against the discovered dataset (Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season table) as the authoritative source available.
- “Free transfer fee” is operationalized as any record where the transfer fee text contains the substring “free” (case-insensitive).
