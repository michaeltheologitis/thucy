Claim to verify: “brian watt win exactly 1 major tournament.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database for the TabFact dataset. Within the public schema, a relevant table named public.brian_watts was found, which lists performance across golf’s major championships.

Evidence retrieved (with exact executed SQL)
1) List all available rows for Brian Watts across majors:
SQL:
SELECT tournament, wins, "top - 5", "top - 25", events, "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts;
Results (tournament | wins | top - 5 | top - 25 | events | cuts made):
- masters tournament | 0 | 0 | 0 | 2 | 1
- us open | 0 | 0 | 1 | 2 | 1
- the open championship | 0 | 1 | 2 | 7 | 4
- pga championship | 0 | 0 | 0 | 6 | 4
- totals | 0 | 1 | 3 | 17 | 10

2) Compute total major wins across the four men’s golf majors (Masters, US Open, The Open Championship, PGA Championship):
SQL:
SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_major_wins FROM public.brian_watts WHERE tournament IN ('masters tournament','us open','the open championship','pga championship');
Result:
- total_major_wins: 0

Findings
- All four major championships list 0 wins for Brian Watts.
- The summed total of major wins is 0, not 1.

Conclusion
- The claim that “brian watt win exactly 1 major tournament” is contradicted by the data: he has 0 major wins.

Assumptions made
- “brian watt” refers to professional golfer Brian Watts (note the surname in the data is “Watts”).
- “major tournament” refers to the four men’s professional golf majors: Masters Tournament, U.S. Open, The Open Championship, and PGA Championship.
