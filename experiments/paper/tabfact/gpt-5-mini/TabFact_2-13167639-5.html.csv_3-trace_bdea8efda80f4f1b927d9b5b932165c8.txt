Claim assessed: “the match play on 7 january record a attendance greater than 70000.”

Data source explored: TabFact database, public schema, table t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season (columns: date [text], round [text], opponents [text], result f - a [text], attendance [bigint]).

Evidence queries and results:
1) Query to find matches on 7 January
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponents, "result f - a" AS result, attendance, (attendance > 70000) AS attendance_gt_70000
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%7 January%';

Result:
- Date: 7 january 2003 | Opponents: blackburn rovers | Result: 1 - 1 | Attendance: 62740 | Attendance > 70000: false

2) Cross-check: list all January matches to ensure coverage
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponents, "result f - a", attendance
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%jan%' OR date ILIKE '%january%'
ORDER BY date;

Results:
- 7 january 2003 | blackburn rovers | 1 - 1 | 62740
- 22 january 2003 | blackburn rovers | 3 - 1 | 29048

Conclusion:
- The only match on 7 January in this dataset is on 7 January 2003 with attendance 62,740, which is not greater than 70,000. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “the match play on 7 january” refers to the match dated 7 January in the available 2002–03 Manchester United season table. The date column is text; matching was done case-insensitively using ILIKE.
