Claim to verify:
- "bosone's cardinalatial order and title be cardinal - priest of s anastasia and be elevate circa 1116"

Data sources explored:
- TabFact database. Available table: public.papal_election_1119 (columns: elector, nationality, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator).

Evidence retrieved:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT elector, "cardinalatial order and title", elevated, elevator
  FROM public.papal_election_1119
  WHERE (elector ILIKE '%boso%' OR elector ILIKE '%boson%' OR elector ILIKE '%bosone%')
     OR ("cardinalatial order and title" ILIKE '%anastasia%');

- Result row:
  - elector: bosone
  - cardinalatial order and title: cardinal - priest of s anastasia
  - elevated: circa 1116
  - elevator: paschal ii

Assessment:
- The database explicitly lists an elector named "bosone" with the title "cardinal - priest of s anastasia" and an elevation date "circa 1116." This matches the claim exactly.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "bosone" as the elector record named "bosone" in the papal_election_1119 table.
- Used case-insensitive matching for variant spellings and searched by titular church substring ("anastasia").
