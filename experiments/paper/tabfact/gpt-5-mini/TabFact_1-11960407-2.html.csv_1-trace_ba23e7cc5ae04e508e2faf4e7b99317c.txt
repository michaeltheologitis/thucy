Claim to verify: “the result of the game on November 20 in Dallas be W 110 - 101 (OT).”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: postgres_tabfact23
- Schema: public
- Available table: t_2007_08_toronto_raptors_season (game-by-game data for the 2007–08 Toronto Raptors season)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Locate the November 20 game in Dallas within the available season table.

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, score, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2007_08_toronto_raptors_season WHERE date = 'november 20' AND team = 'dallas';

Query result:
- date: november 20
- team: dallas
- score: l 99 - 105 (ot)
- location attendance: american airlines center 20272

Analysis:
- The recorded result for the November 20 game in Dallas is a loss, 99–105, in overtime. This directly contradicts the claim that it was a win, 110–101 (OT).

Conclusion:
- The available authoritative data shows the game outcome was “L 99–105 (OT),” not “W 110–101 (OT).”

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the team/season represented by the available data source (2007–08 Toronto Raptors), as this is the only accessible dataset and it includes a game listed on November 20 at Dallas.
