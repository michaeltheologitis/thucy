Claim interpreted: Glenn Capriola was not selected before round 6 (i.e., he was not a rounds 1–5 pick) in the available draft data.

Evidence from the data:
1) Locate Glenn Capriola in the draft table
- Result: 1 matching row — round 9, pick 24, overall 247, name: glenn capriola, position: running back, college: boston college
- Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
WHERE name ILIKE '%capriola%';

2) Check explicitly for any selection of Glenn Capriola before round 6
- Result: 0 rows (no entries with round < 6)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, round FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%glenn capriola%' AND round < 6;

(Confirmatory count)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%glenn capriola%' AND round < 6;
- Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion: The data shows Glenn Capriola was drafted in round 9, and there are no records of him being selected in rounds 1–5. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- Context is the Indianapolis Colts draft history (the only accessible dataset) and refers to NFL draft rounds.
- “Not selected before round 6” is interpreted as not selected in rounds 1–5.
