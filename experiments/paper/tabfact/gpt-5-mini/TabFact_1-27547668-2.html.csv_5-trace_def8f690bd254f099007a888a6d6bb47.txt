Data sources explored
- Discovered PostgreSQL source: postgres_tabfact25, public schema, with one table: list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes.

Schema inspection
- Tool: Schema query
- Table: list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
- Columns: "Unnamed: 0" bigint, "title" text, "directed by" text, "written by" text, "viewers" bigint, "original airdate" text, "prod code" bigint

Step 1: Inspect airdate format and available rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "original airdate" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes ORDER BY "Unnamed: 0" LIMIT 20;
Findings (10 total rows exist):
- original airdate values include: "january 6 , 2010", "january 13 , 2010", "january 20 , 2010", "february 3 , 2010", "february 10 , 2010", followed by five March dates. Format: lowercase month name, day, year, with an extra space before the comma.

Row count confirmation
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes;
Result: 10 rows.

Step 2: Count episodes by month and focus on January vs. February
Exploratory month-token check
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT split_part("original airdate", ' ', 1) AS first_word, COUNT(*)
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
GROUP BY first_word
ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC;
Result:
- march: 5
- january: 3
- february: 2

Counts by calendar month
Executed SQL:
SELECT INITCAP(lower_month) AS month, cnt AS episode_count
FROM (
  SELECT split_part(lower("original airdate"), ' ', 1) AS lower_month, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  GROUP BY lower_month
) t
ORDER BY CASE lower_month WHEN 'january' THEN 1 WHEN 'february' THEN 2 WHEN 'march' THEN 3 ELSE 99 END;
Result:
- January: 3
- February: 2
- March: 5

Focused comparison (January vs. February)
Executed SQL:
SELECT INITCAP(lower_month) AS month, cnt AS episode_count
FROM (
  SELECT split_part(lower("original airdate"), ' ', 1) AS lower_month, COUNT(*) AS cnt
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  GROUP BY lower_month
) t
WHERE lower_month IN ('january','february')
ORDER BY CASE lower_month WHEN 'january' THEN 1 WHEN 'february' THEN 2 END;
Result:
- January: 3
- February: 2

Conclusion
- The data show 3 episodes aired in January and 2 in February (for the episodes present in this table). The claim states the reverse: 3 in February and 2 in January. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions noted
- The claim is interpreted against the only accessible dataset, which appears to list episodes (likely of "Republic of Doyle").
- Month identification is based on the first token of the "original airdate" text, which is consistently a lowercase month name in this table.
- No specific year/season was provided; results reflect all rows available in this table.
