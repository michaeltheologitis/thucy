Claim to verify: “Season 3 of Dexter aired between September 28 and December 7, 2008.”

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
  - Table: dexter_season_3 (episode-level info including original air dates)

Step 1: List episodes with air dates (evidence of range)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in season", title, "original air date", to_date(initcap(replace("original air date",' ,',',')), 'Month DD, YYYY') AS ad
FROM public.dexter_season_3
ORDER BY ad ASC;
Results (ordered by parsed date):
1) no in season: 1 — title: our father — original air date: september 28 , 2008
2) no in season: 2 — title: finding freebo — original air date: october 5 , 2008
3) no in season: 3 — title: the lion sleeps tonight — original air date: october 12 , 2008
4) no in season: 4 — title: all in the family — original air date: october 19 , 2008
5) no in season: 5 — title: turning biminese — original air date: october 26 , 2008
6) no in season: 6 — title: sá se puede — original air date: november 2 , 2008
7) no in season: 7 — title: easy as pie — original air date: november 9 , 2008
8) no in season: 8 — title: the damage a man can do — original air date: november 16 , 2008
9) no in season: 10 — title: go your own way — original air date: november 30 , 2008
10) no in season: 11 — title: i had a dream — original air date: december 7 , 2008

Step 2: Confirm earliest and latest dates and episode count
Executed SQL (1/2 – inspect raw distinct date strings):
SELECT DISTINCT "original air date" FROM dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "original air date";
Result rows:
- december 7 , 2008
- november 16 , 2008
- november 2 , 2008
- november 30 , 2008
- november 9 , 2008
- october 12 , 2008
- october 19 , 2008
- october 26 , 2008
- october 5 , 2008
- september 28 , 2008

Executed SQL (2/2 – parse to dates, compute min/max, count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episodes,
MIN(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) AS earliest,
MAX(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) AS latest
FROM dexter_season_3;
Result:
- episodes: 10
- earliest: 2008-09-28
- latest: 2008-12-07

Assessment
- The available dataset lists episodes whose parsed air dates span from 2008-09-28 to 2008-12-07. This supports the claim’s date range for the episodes present in the table.
- However, the table contains only 10 entries and skips some episode numbers (e.g., 9, possibly others), suggesting the episode list may be incomplete. Because of this incompleteness, while the earliest and latest dates in the dataset match the claim, we cannot conclusively verify that December 7, 2008 was the final air date for the entire season based solely on this table.

Conclusion
- The dataset confirms that Season 3 episodes (as recorded here) aired between September 28 and December 7, 2008, but the apparent incompleteness prevents confirming the full-season span with certainty.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the season’s overall run (premiere to final episode). The data appears incomplete, so the conclusion is based strictly on the entries available in dexter_season_3.
- Date strings required normalization (spacing and capitalization) to parse consistently; the normalization steps are shown in the executed SQL.
