Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. Summing the agriculture values across all five listed years yields 54.

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact4)
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (columns: year, regional gva, agriculture, industry, services)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm the 5-year list and per-year agriculture values
- SQL:
  SELECT year, agriculture FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (year -> agriculture):
  - 1995 -> 11
  - 2000 -> 10
  - 2003 -> 11
  - 2005 -> 11
  - 2007 -> 11
  (Five years are present.)

2) Compute the total sum across all years
- SQL:
  SELECT SUM(agriculture) AS total_agriculture FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: total_agriculture = 54

Interpretation
- The table contains exactly five years. The agriculture values for those years (11, 10, 11, 11, 11) sum to 54, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to summing the agriculture column across all available years in public.my_info_table, which contains five records.
- Units for the agriculture values are not specified; verification is purely numeric based on stored values.
