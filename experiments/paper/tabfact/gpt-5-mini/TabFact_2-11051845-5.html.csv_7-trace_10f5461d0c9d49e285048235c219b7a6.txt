Claim interpreted: In the available NGC list (the table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000), there are exactly two entries whose object type is spiral galaxy.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one accessible table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000, containing NGC objects numbered 5001–6000 with columns: "ngc number", "object type", "constellation", "right ascension ( j2000 )", "declination ( j2000 )", and "apparent magnitude".

Evidence from the data:
1) Count of entries where object type contains the phrase "spiral galaxy"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_spiral_galaxies
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%spiral galaxy%';
- Result:
  count_spiral_galaxies = 2

2) List of NGC numbers and exact object type values matching the above condition
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type"
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%spiral galaxy%'
  ORDER BY "ngc number";
- Result rows:
  5457 — spiral galaxy
  5474 — spiral galaxy

3) Check for any other object types containing the word "spiral"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "object type", count(*) AS type_count, string_agg(CAST("ngc number" AS text), ', ' ORDER BY "ngc number") AS ngc_numbers
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE lower("object type") LIKE '%spiral%'
  GROUP BY "object type"
  ORDER BY "object type";
- Result:
  object type: spiral galaxy | type_count: 2 | ngc_numbers: 5457, 5474

Conclusion:
- The table contains exactly two NGC entries classified as "spiral galaxy": NGC 5457 and NGC 5474. This supports the claim under the interpreted meaning.

Assumptions made:
- "the list" refers to the available table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (NGC 5001–6000) discovered via the data tools.
- "spiral galaxy" is taken literally from the "object type" column and matched case-insensitively as a substring (so it would also include phrases like "barred spiral galaxy" if present; in this dataset only the exact phrase "spiral galaxy" appears).
