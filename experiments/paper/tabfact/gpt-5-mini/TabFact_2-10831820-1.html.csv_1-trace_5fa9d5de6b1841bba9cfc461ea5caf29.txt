Claim interpreted: “The actor who portrays the character Ariadne Oliver is Hugh Fraser.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes (columns: actor, character, "title / rank", series, years)

Evidence 1: Who plays Ariadne Oliver in this dataset?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT actor, character FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE lower(trim(character)) = 'ariadne oliver';
- Result:
  zoë wanamaker | ariadne oliver

Additional corroboration (broader match on name):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT actor, character FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE lower(character) LIKE '%ariadne%';
- Result:
  {"actor":"zoë wanamaker","character":"ariadne oliver"}

Evidence 2: What character(s) does Hugh Fraser play in this dataset?
- Executed SQL (to confirm actor name format):
  SELECT DISTINCT actor FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE actor ILIKE '%Hugh%';
- Result:
  {"actor":"hugh fraser"}
- Executed SQL (list distinct characters for Hugh Fraser):
  SELECT DISTINCT "character" FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE lower(actor) = 'hugh fraser' ORDER BY "character";
- Result:
  {"character":"arthur hastings"}

Conclusion:
- The table shows Ariadne Oliver is portrayed by Zoë Wanamaker, not Hugh Fraser. Hugh Fraser is associated with the character Arthur Hastings. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Actor of the character Ariadne Oliver” is interpreted within the scope of Agatha Christie’s Poirot TV episodes, as represented by the available dataset. Case-insensitive matching was used to ensure robust name comparison.
