Claim: "the bowler with 13 wicket appear in more match than the bowler with 11 wicket"

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1948_ashes_series
  Columns: player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text)

Evidence queries and results:
1) SQL executed:
SELECT player, team, matches, wickets, average, "best bowling" FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets = 13 ORDER BY matches DESC;
Result:
- player: keith miller | team: australia | matches: 5 | wickets: 13 | average: 23.15 | best bowling: 4 / 125

2) SQL executed:
SELECT player, team, matches, wickets, average, "best bowling" FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets = 11 ORDER BY matches DESC;
Result:
- player: ernie toshack | team: australia | matches: 4 | wickets: 11 | average: 33.09 | best bowling: 5 / 40

Comparison:
- Bowler with 13 wickets (Keith Miller) appeared in 5 matches.
- Bowler with 11 wickets (Ernie Toshack) appeared in 4 matches.
- 5 > 4, so the bowler with 13 wickets appeared in more matches than the bowler with 11 wickets.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "appear in more match" is interpreted as having a higher value in the 'matches' column.
- "the bowler with 13 wicket/11 wicket" refers to the unique players in this table with exactly 13 and 11 wickets, respectively (each group returned exactly one row).
