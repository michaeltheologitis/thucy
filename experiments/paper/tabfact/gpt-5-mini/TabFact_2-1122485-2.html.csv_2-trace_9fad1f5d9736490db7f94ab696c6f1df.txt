Summary
I verified the claim against the available data for the 1971 South African Grand Prix (table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix). The data shows Jackie Stewart on grid position 1, Howden Ganley on grid position 24, and Alex Soler-Roig on grid position 25, with 25 being the maximum grid number in the table.

Data source overview
- Database: postgres_tabfact16
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
- Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Jackie Stewart’s grid position
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'jackie stewart';
- Result: [{"driver":"jackie stewart","grid":1}]

2) Howden Ganley’s grid position
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'howden ganley';
- Result: [{"driver":"howden ganley","grid":24}]

3) Alex Soler-Roig’s grid position
- SQL:
  SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'alex soler - roig';
- Result: [{"driver":"alex soler - roig","grid":25}]

4) Maximum grid number in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(grid) AS max_grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- Result: [{"max_grid":25}]

Assessment
- Jackie Stewart is in 1st grid position: Supported.
- Howden Ganley is in 24th grid position: Supported.
- Alex Soler-Roig is in 25th grid position (the highest/last grid number present): Supported.
- The maximum grid number present is 25: Supported.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1971 South African Grand Prix starting grid represented by the available table.
- “Highest position” is interpreted as the highest grid number (i.e., furthest back on the grid).
- Driver names were matched as stored in the table (lowercase; Alex Soler-Roig appears as "alex soler - roig").
