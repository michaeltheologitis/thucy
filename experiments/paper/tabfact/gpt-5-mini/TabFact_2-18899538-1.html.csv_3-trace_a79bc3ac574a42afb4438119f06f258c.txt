Claim interpreted: “The Home Media Center has no OS X and Windows.” I interpret this as asserting that the entry named “home media center” does not support either OS X or Windows.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact instance), schema: public.
- Relevant table (via schema inspection): comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers with columns: name, license, os x, unix - like, windows, web interface.

Evidence from data
1) Locate the Home Media Center row and check OS X and Windows support
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "os x", "windows" FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name ILIKE '%Home%';
- Result row:
  { name: "home media center", os x: "no", windows: "yes" }

2) Full record for confirmation
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name ILIKE 'home media center';
- Result row (one row):
  - license: gplv2
  - name: home media center
  - os x: no
  - unix - like: no
  - web interface: yes
  - windows: yes

Conclusion
- OS X support: no
- Windows support: yes
- Therefore, the statement that Home Media Center has “no OS X and Windows” is only half-correct: it lacks OS X support but does support Windows.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “the home media center have no os x and window” to mean the product entry named “home media center” does not support either OS X or Windows.
