Claim interpreted: “Under the Influence charted at 56 in the US in 1985 and 1986.”

Data sources discovered:
- postgres_tabfact20 (schema: public)
  - Table: vanity_performer(year bigint, title text, "us" text, "us r&b" text, "us dance" text)

Evidence collected:
1) Locate rows for title 'Under the Influence'
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, title, "us", "us r&b", "us dance" FROM vanity_performer WHERE title ILIKE 'Under the Influence';
- Result:
  [{"title":"under the influence","us":"56","us dance":"6","us r&b":"9","year":1986}]
- Finding: “Under the Influence” appears only in 1986 and shows US = 56 (with R&B = 9, Dance = 6).

2) Check what exists for 1985
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, "us" FROM public.vanity_performer WHERE year = 1985;
- Result:
  - title: mechanical emotion, us: 107
- Finding: The only 1985 entry is “mechanical emotion” with US = 107; no “Under the Influence” entry for 1985.

3) Confirm all 1986 entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM vanity_performer WHERE year = 1986;
- Results (columns: year, title, us, us r&b, us dance):
  1) year: 1986, title: under the influence, us: 56, us r&b: 9, us dance: 6
  2) year: 1986, title: animals, us: -, us r&b: -, us dance: -
- Finding: Confirms “Under the Influence” charted at US = 56 in 1986; no other 1986 entries contradict this.

Conclusion:
- The data shows “Under the Influence” charted at 56 in the US in 1986.
- There is no evidence it charted at 56 in 1985; in 1985 the only entry present is “Mechanical Emotion” (US = 107).

Assumptions made:
- “Under the Influence” refers to the entry in the vanity_performer table, and the "us" column reflects the main US singles chart (e.g., Billboard Hot 100). The table is treated as authoritative per instructions.
