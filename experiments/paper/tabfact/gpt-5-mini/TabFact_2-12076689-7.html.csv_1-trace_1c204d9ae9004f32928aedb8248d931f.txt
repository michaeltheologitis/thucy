Claim interpreted: “All games in the 2006 season were played in September.” I verify this against the available data source for the 2006 season in our environment.

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Step 1 — Inspect sample rows to understand the date format
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 10;
Results (excerpt):
1) date: "september 1"; 2) "september 2"; …; 10) "september 12"
Observation: date strings are stored as lowercase month name + day (no year).

Step 2 — Count total games and how many are in September; list distinct months present
2a) Executed SQL (total games):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season;
Result: total_games = 27

2b) Executed SQL (games starting with “september”):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS september_games FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'september%';
Result: september_games = 26

2c) Executed SQL (distinct month tokens):
SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(date, ' ', 1))) AS month_token FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE date IS NOT NULL AND TRIM(date) <> '' ORDER BY month_token;
Result: month_token = ["october", "september"]

Step 3 — Show the non-September game(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE lower(split_part(date, ' ', 1)) = 'october';
Result:
- date: october 1; opponent: mariners; score: 3 - 2; loss: tejeda (5 - 5); attendance: 28361; record: 80 - 82

Conclusion
- Not all games were played in September. The dataset shows 27 total games, 26 in September and 1 on October 1. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “2006 season” is interpreted as the available 2006 season table for the Texas Rangers (public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season).
- “Game” corresponds to a row in that table.
- “Month of Sep” means dates whose first token (month) equals “september” in the date text.
