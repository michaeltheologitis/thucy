Claim to verify: “the match with the highest attendance be against sheffield united.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL instance (TabFact) with a public schema. The schema contains one relevant table: t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season, which includes columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the maximum attendance recorded in the season table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_att FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season;
Result:
- max_att = 38433

2) Retrieve the match(es) whose attendance equals this maximum to see the opponent.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE attendance = 38433;
Result row:
- date: 1 april 2001; opponent: sheffield united; venue: h; result: 1 - 2; attendance: 38433

Conclusion
- The match with the highest attendance (38,433) in this dataset was against Sheffield United on 1 April 2001 (home), result 1–2.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the matches recorded in the table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (i.e., Sheffield Wednesday F.C.’s 2000–01 season). The table appears to contain all relevant fixtures for that season.
- Attendance maximum is taken over non-null values; venue code “h” denotes home.
