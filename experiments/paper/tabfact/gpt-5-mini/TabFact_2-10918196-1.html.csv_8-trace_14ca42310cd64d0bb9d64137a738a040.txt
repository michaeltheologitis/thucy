Claim to verify: "the new york jet play the miami dolphins before denver bronco during the 1993 season"

Summary conclusion: The data show the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1, and the Miami Dolphins in Weeks 2 and 10 of the 1993 season. Therefore, the Jets did not play the Dolphins before the Broncos; they faced the Broncos first.

Evidence from data

Step 1: Retrieve the 1993 Jets games vs Dolphins/Broncos to see weeks and dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Dolphins%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Broncos%' ORDER BY week ASC;

Result:
- Week 1 | Date: 1993 - 09 - 05 | Opponent: denver broncos | Result: l 26 - 20 | Game site: the meadowlands
- Week 2 | Date: 1993 - 09 - 12 | Opponent: miami dolphins   | Result: w 24 - 14 | Game site: joe robbie stadium
- Week 10 | Date: 1993 - 11 - 07 | Opponent: miami dolphins  | Result: w 27 - 10 | Game site: the meadowlands

Step 2: Confirm earliest weeks and counts for each opponent
2a) Verify exact opponent names in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season ORDER BY opponent;

Returned opponents include: denver broncos; miami dolphins; (plus other teams in 1993 schedule)

2b) Compute earliest week and number of games against each opponent of interest
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, MIN(week) AS earliest_week, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season
WHERE opponent IN ('miami dolphins','denver broncos')
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY opponent;

Result:
- denver broncos | earliest_week = 1 | games = 1
- miami dolphins  | earliest_week = 2 | games = 2

Interpretation
- The Jets’ first game vs Broncos occurred in Week 1 (earlier than any game vs the Dolphins).
- The earliest game vs the Dolphins is Week 2, which is after Week 1. Hence, the Dolphins were not played before the Broncos in 1993.

Answer: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "new york jet" and "denver bronco" are interpreted as the New York Jets and Denver Broncos NFL teams.
- "play" refers to regular-season games in the 1993 season (the available table is for the 1993 New York Jets season).
