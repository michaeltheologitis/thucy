Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact). Relevant table found: public.t_1981_open_championship with columns: place, player, country, score, to par.

What I checked:
- Counted the number of listed players per country in the 1981 Open Championship table, focusing on England, Australia, and the United States.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Full counts by country
SQL executed:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country;
Results:
- argentina: 1
- australia: 2
- england: 5
- japan: 1
- new zealand: 1
- scotland: 1
- united states: 5

2) Targeted counts for England, Australia, United States
SQL executed:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
WHERE country IN ('england','australia','united states')
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country;
Results:
- australia: 2
- england: 5
- united states: 5

Findings:
- England: 5 players
- United States: 5 players
- Australia: 2 players (not 5)

Conclusion:
- The claim that England, Australia, and the United States each have 5 players in the 1981 Open Championship is contradicted by the data. England and the United States each have 5, but Australia has 2.

Assumptions:
- Each row in public.t_1981_open_championship corresponds to one listed player, so COUNT(*) represents the number of players per country.
- Country values are stored in lowercase and matched exactly as returned by the database.
