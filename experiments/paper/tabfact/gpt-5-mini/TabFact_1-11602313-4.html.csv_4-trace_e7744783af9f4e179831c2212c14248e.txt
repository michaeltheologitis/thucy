Data source discovery:
- Used discover_data_sources: Found a PostgreSQL database named TabFact with a public schema.

Schema inspection:
- Used schema_query on TabFact (public): Identified table public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors with a column named socket intended to store CPU socket types.

Evidence retrieval:
- Ran a query to retrieve the socket for the Pentium Dual-Core T2410.

Executed SQL:
SELECT "model number", "socket", "frequency", "fsb" 
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
WHERE "model number" ILIKE '%t2410%';

Query result (single matching row):
- model number: pentium dual - core t2410
- socket: socket p
- frequency: 2 ghz
- fsb: 533 mt / s

Analysis:
- The record explicitly lists the socket as "socket p" for the Pentium Dual-Core T2410. This directly supports the claim that the Pentium Dual-Core T2410 uses a P socket (Socket P).

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data: Pentium Dual-Core T2410 has Socket P.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "p socket" to mean "Socket P" (standard naming for Intel mobile socket of that era).
- Performed a case-insensitive match on the model field to locate the T2410 entry.
- Trusted the TabFact database as authoritative for this verification, as instructed.
