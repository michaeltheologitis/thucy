Summary
- Claim: “6 different country receive the same number of bronze medal.”
- Dataset used: TabFact (postgres_tabfact2), public.t_1988_winter_olympics (nation-level medal counts for the 1988 Winter Olympics).
- Finding: Verified. Exactly six nations have the same bronze medal count of 2.

Data source and structure checked
- Table: public.t_1988_winter_olympics
- Columns: rank (bigint), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distribution of nations by bronze count
SQL:
SELECT bronze, COUNT(*) AS num_nations
FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics
GROUP BY bronze
ORDER BY num_nations DESC, bronze ASC;
Results (relevant rows):
- bronze = 2, num_nations = 6
- bronze = 3, num_nations = 2
- bronze = 5, num_nations = 1
- bronze = 6, num_nations = 1
- bronze = 9, num_nations = 1
Interpretation: There is a bronze count (2) shared by exactly six nations.

2) Nations with bronze = 2
SQL:
SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics
WHERE bronze = 2
ORDER BY rank;
Results:
- rank 4: finland (fin) — gold 4, silver 1, bronze 2, total 7

- rank 6: austria (aut) — gold 3, silver 5, bronze 2, total 10
