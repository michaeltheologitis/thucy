Claim to verify: “collingwood have a home team score that be 3 time higher than that of geelong.”

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (Postgres)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1954_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Step 1 — Confirm relevant rows exist for both teams
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
GROUP BY "home team"
ORDER BY "home team";

Result (excerpt):
- collingwood: 1
- geelong: 1
(Each appears exactly once as a home team in this table.)

Step 2 — Retrieve the home team scores for Collingwood and Geelong
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE lower("home team") IN ('collingwood','geelong');

Results:
- geelong: 13.12 (90)
- collingwood: 12.16 (88)

Step 3 — Parse numeric totals from the score strings
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", (substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)'))::int AS score_total
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") IN ('collingwood','geelong');

Results:
- home team: geelong, home team score: 13.12 (90), score_total: 90
- home team: collingwood, home team score: 12.16 (88), score_total: 88

Step 4 — Compute the ratio Collingwood / Geelong
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='collingwood' THEN COALESCE(NULLIF(split_part(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',1),'') , regexp_replace("home team score",'[^0-9]','','g'))::int ELSE 0 END) AS coll_total,
  SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='geelong' THEN COALESCE(NULLIF(split_part(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',1),'') , regexp_replace("home team score",'[^0-9]','', 'g'))::int ELSE 0 END) AS geel_total,
  ROUND(
    SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='collingwood' THEN COALESCE(NULLIF(split_part(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',1),'') , regexp_replace("home team score",'[^0-9]','', 'g'))::int ELSE 0 END)::numeric
    /
    NULLIF(SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='geelong' THEN COALESCE(NULLIF(split_part(split_part("home team score",'(',2),')',1),'') , regexp_replace("home team score",'[^0-9]','', 'g'))::int ELSE 0 END),0)::numeric, 6) AS ratio
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood','geelong');

Results:
- coll_total = 88
- geel_total = 90
- ratio = 0.977778 (i.e., 88/90 = 44/45)

Conclusion
- Collingwood’s home team score (88) is not three times higher than Geelong’s (90). In fact, it is slightly lower. The data contradicts the claim.

Assumptions
- “Home team score” refers to the total points shown in parentheses in the score string (e.g., 13.12 (90) → 90).
- Verification is performed within the public.t_1954_vfl_season table of the provided database. If a different season or dataset was intended, results could differ.
- “3 times higher” is interpreted as at least threefold (>= 3×). Under the alternative colloquial interpretation (“three times as high” or even “higher by three times,” i.e., 4×), the claim remains false.
