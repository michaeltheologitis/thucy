Claim to verify: “pennsylvania17 be the only district that have someone first elect in the 1980s.”

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
- Relevant columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (bigint), status (text), opponent (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Identify all rows where the incumbent was first elected in the 1980s (1980–1989 inclusive):
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE "first elected" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989 ORDER BY district;
Result:
- district: pennsylvania17 | incumbent: george gekas | party: republican | first elected: 1982
- district: pennsylvania7  | incumbent: curt weldon  | party: republican | first elected: 1986

2) Count how many districts have an incumbent first elected in the 1980s:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_1980s FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE "first elected" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;
Result:
- count_1980s: 2

3) Context: list distinct districts and their incumbents with first elected year to show the full Pennsylvania subset in this table:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT district, incumbent, "first elected" FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 ORDER BY district, incumbent;
Result (district — incumbent — first elected):
- pennsylvania12 — john murtha — 1974
- pennsylvania17 — george gekas — 1982
- pennsylvania18 — rick santorum — 1990
- pennsylvania19 — william f goodling — 1974
- pennsylvania4 — ron klink — 1992
- pennsylvania5 — william f clinger , jr — 1978
- pennsylvania7 — curt weldon — 1986
- pennsylvania9 — bud shuster — 1972

Analysis:
- The dataset shows that both pennsylvania17 (George Gekas, first elected 1982) and pennsylvania7 (Curt Weldon, first elected 1986) have incumbents first elected in the 1980s. Therefore, pennsylvania17 is not the only district with an incumbent first elected in the 1980s.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “first elect in the 1980s” as the incumbent’s “first elected” year being between 1980 and 1989 inclusive.
- Interpreted “pennsylvania17” as the district label used in the table (e.g., “pennsylvania17”).
- Verification is constrained to the available 1994 Pennsylvania House election entries present in the discovered table.
