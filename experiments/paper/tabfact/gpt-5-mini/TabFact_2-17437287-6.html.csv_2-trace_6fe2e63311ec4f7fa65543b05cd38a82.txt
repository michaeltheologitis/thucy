Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that for tie number 2, Sheffield Wednesday are the home team.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact28)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1983_84_fa_cup with columns ["tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"]

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all rows where tie no = '2'
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE "tie no" = '2';
Result:
- tie no: 2; home team: sheffield wednesday; score: 0 - 0; away team: southampton; date: 11 march 1984

2) Check specifically whether any such row has Sheffield Wednesday as the home team
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS sheff_wed_count FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE "tie no" = '2' AND "home team" ILIKE 'Sheffield Wednesday';
Result:
- sheff_wed_count: 1

Conclusion: The data shows that for tie number 2, Sheffield Wednesday were indeed the home team (Sheffield Wednesday 0-0 Southampton on 11 March 1984). This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the available dataset table t_1983_84_fa_cup (1983–84 FA Cup) and to an exact tie number value of '2'.
- Team name comparison was done case-insensitively.
