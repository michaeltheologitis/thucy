Claim assessed: "Gerardo Reinoso was sacked by Firpo on August 25, 2008."

Data discovery and approach:
- Explored the available database (postgres_tabfact21) and identified a relevant table in the public schema: primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008. Column names indicate it tracks managerial changes (team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replaced by, date of appointment, position in table).

Evidence gathered (executed SQL and results):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE team ILIKE '%Firpo%' OR "outgoing manager" ILIKE '%Gerardo Reinoso%';

- Key returned row:
  - team: firpo
  - outgoing manager: gerardo reinoso
  - manner of departure: sacked
  - date of vacancy: 25 august 2008
  - replaced by: oscar benitez
  - date of appointment: 2 september 2008
  - position in table: 7th

Conclusion:
- The table explicitly records that Gerardo Reinoso (outgoing manager of Firpo) was sacked, with a vacancy date of 25 August 2008. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- "Firpo" refers to C.D. Luis Ángel Firpo (El Salvador).
- "be sack" is interpreted as "was sacked" (dismissed as manager).
- Dates are interpreted in day-month-year format as shown in the table ("25 august 2008").
