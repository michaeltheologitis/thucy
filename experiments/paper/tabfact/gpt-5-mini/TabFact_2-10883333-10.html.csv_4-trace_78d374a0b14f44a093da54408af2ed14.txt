Summary
- Interpreting the claim as: within the available 1975 VFL season data, the attendance (“crowd”) at Kardinia Park is lower than at Moorabbin Oval.

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact10 (public schema). Relevant table found: public.t_1975_vfl_season (columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date).

Evidence
1) Identify venue names present
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue IS NOT NULL ORDER BY venue;
Result:
- junction oval
- kardinia park
- mcg
- moorabbin oval
- princes park
- vfl park

2) Compare attendance (crowd) for Kardinia Park vs Moorabbin Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT lower(trim(venue)) AS venue, COUNT(*) AS games, SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS avg_crowd
FROM t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE lower(trim(venue)) IN ('kardinia park','moorabbin oval')
GROUP BY lower(trim(venue));
Results:
- kardinia park: games = 1, total_crowd = 13328, avg_crowd = 13328.0
- moorabbin oval: games = 1, total_crowd = 17811, avg_crowd = 17811.0

Conclusion
- In the available 1975 VFL season dataset, Kardinia Park’s recorded crowd (13,328) is lower than Moorabbin Oval’s (17,811). This supports the claim as stated in this data context.

Assumptions
- “Crowd” is interpreted as match attendance recorded in the t_1975_vfl_season table.
- The comparison is made within this dataset only (1975 VFL season data available here). Each venue appears once in this table, so average equals the single recorded match’s attendance.
- Venue name matching is case-insensitive and trimmed (e.g., 'kardinia park', 'moorabbin oval').
