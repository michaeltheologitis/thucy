Claim: A player from the United States and a player from New Zealand were tied for 3rd place.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf with columns (place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text). This table represents results for the 1973 U.S. Open (golf).

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL (to inspect how places are recorded):
  SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;

- Executed SQL (to retrieve all 3rd-place entries, including ties):
  SELECT place, player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(place) IN ('3','t3') ORDER BY player;

Results returned for 3rd place (including ties):
- place: t3, player: bob charles, country: new zealand
- place: t3, player: jack nicklaus, country: united states
- place: t3, player: johnny miller, country: united states

Conclusion:
- The data shows that three players were tied for 3rd place: Bob Charles (New Zealand), Jack Nicklaus (United States), and Johnny Miller (United States). Therefore, players from both the United States and New Zealand were indeed tied for 3rd place.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1973 U.S. Open golf results, as this is the available dataset. 
- "Tie for 3rd place" corresponds to entries labeled 't3' in the place column.
