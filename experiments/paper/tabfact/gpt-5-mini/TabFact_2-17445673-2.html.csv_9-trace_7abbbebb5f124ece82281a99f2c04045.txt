Claim to verify: “the match with the longest time be win against david ross.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8). Only one table available in public schema: public.tim_lajcik, which contains MMA match results with columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time.
  - Evidence (schema inspection): The public schema lists only table tim_lajcik with the above columns.

Relevant data and findings
1) Full table contents (to understand opponents, times, and outcomes)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.tim_lajcik;
- Key rows (abbrev.): includes a row with opponent = “david ross”, res = “win”, round = 1, time = “5:36”; and other rows with times such as 9:49 (vs eugene jackson), 6:58 (vs mark tullius), and several entries at 5:00 across rounds 2–3.

2) Interpretation A — Longest “time” value within a single round (parse mm:ss and take the maximum time field)
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time,
      (CAST(trim(split_part(time, ':', 1)) AS integer) * 60 +
       CAST(trim(regexp_replace(split_part(time, ':', 2), '\\D.*$', '')) AS integer)) AS time_seconds
    FROM public.tim_lajcik
    WHERE time ~ '^\s*\d+:\d{2}'
  )
  SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time, time_seconds
  FROM parsed
  WHERE time_seconds = (SELECT MAX(time_seconds) FROM parsed)
  ORDER BY time_seconds DESC;
- Result: opponent = eugene jackson, res = win, round = 1, time = 9:49 (time_seconds = 589). This is not David Ross.

3) Interpretation B — Longest total fight duration assuming 5-minute rounds: elapsed_seconds = (round − 1)*5*60 + time_seconds
- Executed SQL (with preliminary check of time formats and then computation):
  -- Check time values
  SELECT time, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.tim_lajcik GROUP BY time ORDER BY cnt DESC LIMIT 50;
  -- Compute elapsed and select max
  WITH calc AS (
    SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time,
      ((round - 1) * 5 * 60) + (split_part(time, ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(time, ':', 2)::int) AS elapsed_seconds
    FROM public.tim_lajcik
  )
  SELECT opponent, res, event, round, time, elapsed_seconds
  FROM calc
  WHERE elapsed_seconds = (SELECT MAX(elapsed_seconds) FROM calc);
- Result: Two fights tie for maximum elapsed_seconds = 900 (15:00):
  • opponent = osami shibuya, res = win, round = 3, time = 5:00
  • opponent = ron waterman, res = draw, round = 3, time = 5:00
  Neither opponent is David Ross.

4) Specific check for David Ross row
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT res, event, round, time FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE lower(opponent) = 'david ross';
- Result: res = win; event = ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2; round = 1; time = 5:36.

Conclusion
- Under both interpretations, the match with the longest time is not a win against David Ross.
  • Longest “time” within a round: vs Eugene Jackson (9:49), not David Ross.
  • Longest total duration (assuming 5-minute rounds): 15:00 vs Osami Shibuya (win) and Ron Waterman (draw), not David Ross.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and interpretation notes
- Interpreted “longest time” in two reasonable ways: (A) maximum time field (mm:ss) within the final round; (B) maximum total elapsed time assuming standard 5-minute rounds. Both yield a result not involving David Ross.
- Case-insensitive match used for opponent name.
- Treated the accessible TabFact data as authoritative per instructions.
