Claim interpreted: “Brian Watt [was] not in the top 25 at the Masters Tournament 1 time.” This could mean either (a) he had exactly one non–top-25 finish at the Masters, or (b) he had exactly one top-25 finish at the Masters. I verify against the available data.

Evidence from data
- Data source discovered: TabFact (PostgreSQL, public schema). Relevant table: public.brian_watts with columns: tournament, wins, top - 5, top - 25, events, cuts made.

Executed SQL and results
1) Retrieve all rows for context:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.brian_watts;
Result excerpt for Masters:
- tournament: masters tournament
- top - 25: 0
- events: 2
- cuts made: 1

2) Confirm exact tournament name and compute non–top-25 finishes:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM public.brian_watts WHERE tournament ILIKE '%masters%';
Result:
- masters tournament

SQL:
SELECT tournament, events, "top - 25", (events - "top - 25") AS not_top_25_count
FROM public.brian_watts
WHERE tournament = 'masters tournament';
Result:
- tournament: masters tournament
- events: 2
- top - 25: 0
- not_top_25_count: 2

Assessment
- Top-25 finishes at the Masters: 0 (not 1).
- Non–top-25 finishes at the Masters: 2 (not 1).
Therefore, regardless of interpretation, the claim that this happened “1 time” is not supported by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate per the available database table for Brian Watts.

Assumptions
- “Master tournament” refers to the Masters Tournament (men’s golf major). The table uses the label “masters tournament,” which I matched via ILIKE.
- The name in the table is “brian_watts,” which I interpret as the professional golfer Brian Watts. The table appears to summarize his major championship results by tournament.
