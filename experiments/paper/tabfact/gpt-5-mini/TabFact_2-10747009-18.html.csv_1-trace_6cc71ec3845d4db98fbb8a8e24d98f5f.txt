Claim assessed: "western oval have footscray as it's home team"

Summary conclusion: In the available TabFact database (which contains a table of the 1927 VFL season), the venue listed as "western oval" appears with "footscray" as the home team. This supports the claim within the scope of the available data.

Data sources consulted:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: t_1927_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date")

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Identify venues containing the word "Western":
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM t_1927_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Western%';
Result:
- western oval

2) For that venue, list distinct home teams and the number of matches hosted:
SQL executed:
SELECT venue, "home team", COUNT(*) AS matches_hosted FROM t_1927_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Western%' GROUP BY venue, "home team" ORDER BY venue, matches_hosted DESC, "home team";
Result:
- venue: western oval, home team: footscray, matches_hosted: 1

Interpretation:
- In the 1927 VFL season data, the only venue matching “Western” is “western oval”, and the only home team recorded there is “footscray”. This is consistent with the claim that Western Oval has Footscray as its home team, at least for the matches recorded in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The available data covers only the 1927 VFL season; no other seasons or competitions were accessible. The conclusion is therefore bounded to that dataset.
- Venue names in the dataset appear in lowercase ("western oval"); I treated this as equivalent to “Western Oval”.
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the observed relationship in the dataset rather than asserting an exclusive or current home-ground status beyond 1927.
