Claim to verify: “the episode summary for episode 5 premier on june 29 , 2012 be that rita is made into an actress.”

What I checked
- Identified the available TV-series dataset (public.made_tv_series) and examined entries around June 29, 2012 and episode 5 in 2012.

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Check how dates are stored and whether June 29, 2012 exists in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "premier date" 
  FROM public.made_tv_series
  WHERE "premier date" LIKE '%2012%';
- Returned (excerpt):
  - june 18 , 2012
  - june 19 , 2012
  - june 20 , 2012
  - june 22 , 2012
  - june 25 , 2012
  - june 26 , 2012
  - june 29 , 2012
  (and others)

2) Retrieve the row for the June 29, 2012 premiere
- SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "premier date", "episode summary"
  FROM public.made_tv_series
  WHERE lower("premier date") LIKE '%june 29%';
- Result:
  - season: 13
  - episode: 8
  - premier date: june 29 , 2012
  - episode summary: amber is made into a recording artist

3) Retrieve the row for episode 5 in 2012
- SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "premier date", "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE episode = 5 AND "premier date" LIKE '%2012%';
- Result:
  - season: 13
  - episode: 5
  - premier date: june 25 , 2012
  - episode summary: rita is made into an actress

Assessment of the claim
- “episode 5 … rita is made into an actress” — Supported. The episode 5 entry shows that summary.
- “premier on june 29 , 2012” — Not supported for episode 5. Episode 5 premiered on June 25, 2012. June 29, 2012 corresponds to episode 8 with a different summary (“amber is made into a recording artist”).

Conclusion
- The summary content for episode 5 is correct, but the premiere date given in the claim is incorrect. Therefore, the overall claim is only partially supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Premier dates are stored as text; I used case-insensitive matching to align with the stored format (e.g., “june 29 , 2012”).
- The public.made_tv_series table is treated as authoritative for episode numbers, dates, and summaries.
