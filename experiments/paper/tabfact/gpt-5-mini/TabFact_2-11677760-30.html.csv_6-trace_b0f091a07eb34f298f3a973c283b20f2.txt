Claim to verify: "player shabazz muhammad stand 6 - 11 in height and be from jersey city , nj"

Data source explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact21 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Table: usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team (columns: player, height, school, hometown, college)

Evidence:
1) Retrieve the record for Shabazz Muhammad
SQL executed:
SELECT player, height, school, hometown, college
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
WHERE player ILIKE '%Shabazz Muhammad%';
Result:
- player: shabazz muhammad
- height: 6 - 6
- school: bishop gorman high school
- hometown: las vegas , nv
- college: ucla

2) Check if any Shabazz Muhammad row has height "6 - 11"
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
WHERE player ILIKE 'Shabazz Muhammad'
  AND height ~ '^\s*6\s*-\s*11\s*"?\s*$';
Result:
- cnt: 0
Interpretation: No record for Shabazz Muhammad lists a height of 6 - 11.

3) Search for any player listed as from Jersey City (to test the hometown portion of the claim)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, height, school, hometown, college
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
WHERE lower(hometown) LIKE '%jersey city%';
Result (example row found):
- player: myles mack
- height: 5 - 9
- school: st anthony high school
- hometown: jersey city , nj
- college: rutgers
Interpretation: The table does contain players from Jersey City, NJ, but Shabazz Muhammad is not one of them.

Assessment:
- Height: Data shows Shabazz Muhammad is listed as 6 - 6, not 6 - 11.
- Hometown: Data shows his hometown is las vegas , nv, not jersey city , nj.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- "Player shabazz muhammad" refers to the basketball player record in the USA Today All-USA high school basketball team table.
- "Height 6 - 11" and hometown "jersey city , nj" are to be compared against the table’s height and hometown fields, which use the same formatting style as shown above.
