Claim to verify: “More viewers in the US watched the second episode of Dexter’s third season than the fourth episode.”

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9)
- Table: public.dexter_season_3 (columns include: "no in series", "no in season", "title", "original air date", "us viewers (millions)")

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve raw viewership values for episodes 2 and 4
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in season", "title", "us viewers (millions)" FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE "no in season" IN (2,4) ORDER BY "no in season";
Results:
- no in season: 2, title: finding freebo, us viewers (millions): 0.79
- no in season: 4, title: all in the family, us viewers (millions): 0.86

2) Parse viewership to numeric and compare
Executed SQL:
WITH ep AS (
  SELECT "no in season", "title", regexp_replace("us viewers (millions)", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g')::numeric AS viewers
  FROM public.dexter_season_3
  WHERE "no in season" IN (2,4)
)
SELECT
  json_agg(json_build_object('no in season', "no in season", 'title', "title", 'viewers', viewers) ORDER BY "no in season") AS episodes,
  (SELECT max(viewers)-min(viewers) FROM ep) AS difference_millions,
  (SELECT title FROM ep ORDER BY viewers DESC LIMIT 1) AS highest_title,
  (SELECT viewers FROM ep ORDER BY viewers DESC LIMIT 1) AS highest_viewers,
  (SELECT title FROM ep ORDER BY viewers ASC LIMIT 1) AS lowest_title,
  (SELECT viewers FROM ep ORDER BY viewers ASC LIMIT 1) AS lowest_viewers
FROM ep;
Results:
- Episode 2 (finding freebo): 0.79 million
- Episode 4 (all in the family): 0.86 million
- Difference: 0.07 million (70,000) more viewers for Episode 4

Finding
- Episode 4 had higher US viewership (0.86M) than Episode 2 (0.79M).

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: fewer US viewers watched the second episode than the fourth.

Assumptions
- “Second episode” and “fourth episode” are mapped to rows where "no in season" = 2 and 4, respectively.
- The "us viewers (millions)" field is taken as the authoritative measure of US viewership and was parsed to numeric by stripping non-numeric characters if present.
