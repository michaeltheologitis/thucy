Claim to verify:
“Nadia al-moutawaa was the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and won silver in another year.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: equestrian_at_the_asian_games(year bigint, location text, gold text, silver text, bronze text)

Step-by-step verification and evidence
1) Inspect all records and check for any entries containing the name “Nadia” in gold or silver
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games;

Key rows observed:
- 1982 | new delhi | gold: “nadia al - moutawaa” | silver: “jamila al - moutawaa” | bronze: “bariaa salem al - sabbah”

Filter for “Nadia” (case-insensitive) in gold or silver
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze, 
       (gold ~* '(nad(i|y)a|nadiya)') AS gold_matches,
       (silver ~* '(nad(i|y)a|nadiya)') AS silver_matches
FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games
WHERE (gold ~* '(nad(i|y)a|nadiya)') OR (silver ~* '(nad(i|y)a|nadiya)');

Result:
- 1982 | new delhi | gold = “nadia al - moutawaa” (gold_matches = true) | silver = “jamila al - moutawaa” (silver_matches = false)

2) Confirm that 1982 is the earliest year and identify its gold medalist
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
Result: [{"min_year":1982}]

Executed SQL:
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze 
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE year = 1982;
Result: [{"year":1982,"location":"new delhi","gold":"nadia al - moutawaa","silver":"jamila al - moutawaa","bronze":"bariaa salem al - sabbah"}]

Interpretation:
- 1982 is the earliest year in this dataset, and the gold medalist that year is “nadia al - moutawaa.” This supports the claim that she was the first person (in the dataset’s coverage) to win Asian Games equestrian gold.

3) Check if “nadia al - moutawaa” appears as a silver medalist in any other year
Executed SQL (exact, case-insensitive match):
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze 
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE lower(trim(silver)) = 'nadia al - moutawaa';
Result: null (no rows)

Executed SQL (broader substring check):
SELECT year, location, gold, silver, bronze 
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE lower(silver) LIKE '%nadia%';
Result: null (no rows)

Interpretation:
- There is no evidence in this table that Nadia al - moutawaa won a silver medal in another year.

Conclusion
- Supported: Nadia al - moutawaa is recorded as the gold medalist in 1982, the earliest year in the dataset, making her the first person to win equestrian gold at the Asian Games (per this data).
- Not supported: There is no record of her winning a silver medal in another year.

Therefore, the overall claim is only partially accurate.

Assumptions
- The table equestrian_at_the_asian_games comprehensively lists annual/edition champions for the relevant equestrian event(s) at the Asian Games beginning with 1982; thus, the earliest gold listed corresponds to the “first” winner.
- Name matching used case-insensitive comparisons and included a substring search to catch minor formatting differences.
