Claim to verify: “the surface for october 10 , 2004 be hard.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: postgres_tabfact6 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.ji_nov_k with columns [date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)]

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate 2004 entries and inspect the row for the specified date
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE date LIKE '%2004%'
ORDER BY date
LIMIT 50;

Result:
- Row: date = 'october 10 , 2004'; tournament = 'tokyo , japan'; surface = 'hard'; opponent = 'taylor dent'; score = '5 - 7 , 6 - 1 , 6 - 3'
(Another 2004 row returned for November 3, 2004, shown for completeness.)

2) Directly confirm the surface for the exact date string
Executed SQL:
SELECT surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE date = 'october 10 , 2004';

Result:
- surface = 'hard'

Conclusion
- The data explicitly shows that for the entry dated “october 10 , 2004,” the surface is “hard.” This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “surface” as the court surface for the tennis match record in table public.ji_nov_k (which appears to contain match facts for Jiří Novák).
- Assumed the date string is exactly as stored in the dataset ('october 10 , 2004' with lowercase and a space before the comma).
