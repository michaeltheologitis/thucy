Claim to verify: “Italy receive 2 more gold medal than Canada do but tie with the United State and West Germany.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered one accessible database: postgres_tabfact0 (TabFact), schema public.
- Schema inspection shows one relevant table: public.t_1988_winter_olympics with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total.

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Medal counts for the four nations mentioned (Italy, Canada, United States, West Germany):
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation IN ('italy (ita)','canada (can)','united states (usa)','west germany (frg)') ORDER BY gold DESC;
Result rows:
- 8 | west germany (frg) | 2 | 4 | 2 | 8
- 9 | united states (usa) | 2 | 1 | 3 | 6
- 10 | italy (ita) | 2 | 1 | 2 | 5
- 13 | canada (can) | 0 | 2 | 3 | 5
Interpretation: Italy has 2 golds; Canada has 0; United States has 2; West Germany has 2.

2) Nations with exactly 2 gold medals (to confirm the tie group):
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE gold = 2 ORDER BY nation;
Rows returned:
- italy (ita) — gold 2, silver 1, bronze 2, total 5
- united states (usa) — gold 2, silver 1, bronze 3, total 6
- west germany (frg) — gold 2, silver 4, bronze 2, total 8
Interpretation: Italy ties on gold medal count with the United States and West Germany.

3) Explicit computation of the gold-medal difference Italy minus Canada:
SQL executed (three steps):
- SELECT nation, gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Italy%';
  → {"nation": "italy (ita)", "gold": 2}
- SELECT nation, gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Canada%';
  → {"nation": "canada (can)", "gold": 0}
- SELECT
    ( (SELECT gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Italy%') - (SELECT gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Canada%') ) AS italy_minus_canada,
    abs( (SELECT gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Italy%') - (SELECT gold FROM t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation ILIKE '%Canada%') ) AS absolute_difference;
  → {"italy_minus_canada": 2, "absolute_difference": 2}
Interpretation: Italy has exactly 2 more gold medals than Canada.

Conclusion:
- Italy has 2 golds, Canada has 0 → Italy has 2 more gold medals than Canada.
- Italy, United States, and West Germany each have 2 golds → Italy ties with the United States and West Germany on gold medals.
The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the medal table in public.t_1988_winter_olympics (1988 Winter Olympics) because that is the authoritative dataset available.
- Normalized names: “United State” interpreted as “United States (usa)”; “West Germany” matches “west germany (frg)”.
- “Tie” is interpreted with respect to gold medal counts only (not considering silver/bronze).
