Claim to verify: “shane hall run a total of 198 race between the year of 1996 - 2008”.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.shane_hall (columns include: year, races, wins, poles, top 5, top 10, dnf, finish, start, winnings, season rank, team (s))

Step 1 — Inspect available yearly data for Shane Hall:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, races FROM shane_hall ORDER BY year ASC;
Results:
1995 | 2
1996 | 14
1997 | 28
1998 | 31
1999 | 25
2000 | 2
2001 | 33
2002 | 24
2003 | 5
2004 | 9
2005 | 7
2006 | 9
2008 | 1

Step 2 — Retrieve per-year races within 1996–2008 inclusive:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, races FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1996 AND 2008 ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1996: 14
- 1997: 28
- 1998: 31
- 1999: 25
- 2000: 2
- 2001: 33
- 2002: 24
- 2003: 5
- 2004: 9
- 2005: 7
- 2006: 9
- 2008: 1
(Note: No row for 2007, implying 0 races recorded for that year.)

Step 3 — Compute total races for 1996–2008 inclusive:
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1996 AND 2008;
Result:
- total_races: 188

Conclusion: The data shows Shane Hall ran 188 races between 1996 and 2008 inclusive, not 198. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “between the year of 1996 - 2008” as inclusive of both 1996 and 2008.
- Years with no row in the table (e.g., 2007) contribute 0 to the total.
- Treated the TabFact/public.shane_hall dataset as authoritative for Shane Hall’s race counts.
