Data sources explored
- Discovered source: TabFact PostgreSQL instance (public schema)
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): public.branimir_suba_i with columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)

Verification approach
- Search the table for matches in 2012, then specifically confirm the entry for August 15, 2012, checking score and result fields.

Evidence
1) Query to list 2012 entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE date LIKE '%2012%' ORDER BY date;
Result (rows returned: 1):
- date: august 15 , 2012
  venue: baku , azerbaijan
  score: 3 - 0
  result: win
  competition: friendly

2) Targeted query for the specific date
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i
WHERE (lower(date) LIKE '%august%15%' OR lower(date) LIKE '%15%august%')
  AND lower(date) LIKE '%2012%';
Result (one row):
- date: august 15 , 2012
- venue: baku , azerbaijan
- score: 3 - 0
- result: win
- competition: friendly

Assessment
- The data shows a match on august 15 , 2012 with score 3 - 0 and result win. This fully supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Game” refers to the match records contained in public.branimir_suba_i.
- Matching is case-insensitive and tolerant of spacing/punctuation as stored (e.g., “august 15 , 2012”).
