Claim interpreted: “The scores for Air Force–Navy have all been decided up until 2018.” I evaluate this against the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy table (records service-academy game scores) for seasons through 2018.

Finding: Not all Air Force–Navy scores are decided/recorded as final by 2018 in the data. Specifically, 2014, 2016, and 2018 are not recorded as decided scores (2016 and 2018 are ‘tbd’; 2014 shows a date/location placeholder rather than a score).

Evidence from data (exact executed SQL and results):

1) List seasons ≤ 2018 with the “air force - navy score”
SQL:
SELECT season, "air force - navy score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season <= 2018 ORDER BY season;
Key rows demonstrating undecided/missing scores:
- 2014 — 4 oct 2014 at air force
- 2016 — tbd
- 2018 — tbd
(Other seasons show decided-looking scores, e.g., “16 - 13 (ot)”, “14 - 6”, etc.)

2) Count of seasons ≤ 2018 and count of missing/undecided scores (NULL/empty/“tbd”/etc.)
SQL (total rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season <= 2018;
Result: total_rows = 44

SQL (missing/undecided values treated as NULL, empty string, '-', '—', 'n/a', 'tbd', 'vacated', 'forfeited', or containing 'tie'):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_count FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season <= 2018 AND ("air force - navy score" IS NULL OR trim("air force - navy score") = '' OR lower(trim("air force - navy score")) IN ('-', '—', 'n/a', 'tbd', 'vacated', 'forfeited') OR lower("air force - navy score") LIKE '%tie%');
Result: missing_count = 2 (2016, 2018 = ‘tbd’)

3) Pattern check: rows not matching a decided-score pattern (digits-dash-digits)
SQL (count decided-looking):
SELECT count(*) AS decided_count FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season <= 2018 AND "air force - navy score" ~ '^\d+\s*-\s*\d+(\s+.*)?$';
Result: decided_count = 41

SQL (list non-matching):
SELECT season, "trophy winner", "air force - navy score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season <= 2018 AND NOT ("air force - navy score" ~ '^\d+\s*-\s*\d+(\s+.*)?$') ORDER BY season;
Results:
- 2014 — trophy winner: tbd — air force - navy score: 4 oct 2014 at air force
- 2016 — trophy winner: tbd — air force - navy score: tbd
- 2018 — trophy winner: tbd — air force - navy score: tbd

Conclusion: The data show at least three seasons at or before 2018 where the Air Force–Navy score is not a decided/recorded final score (2014, 2016, 2018). Therefore, the claim that all were decided up until 2018 is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “Decided” means a recorded final numeric score (e.g., “21 - 17”), allowing optional trailing notes like “(ot)”. Values like “tbd” or a date/location line are treated as not decided.
- “Up until 2018” interpreted as up to and including the 2018 season; even if interpreted as up to but not including 2018, 2014 and 2016 still contradict the claim.
