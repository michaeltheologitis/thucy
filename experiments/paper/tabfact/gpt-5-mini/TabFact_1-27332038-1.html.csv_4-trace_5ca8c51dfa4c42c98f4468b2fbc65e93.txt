Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected schema to ground the verification in actual data.
- Queried the Modern Family Season 2 episodes table for the episode titled “halloween” and compared the returned production code and series number to the claim.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: modern_family_season_2
  Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve episode titled “halloween” with production code and series number
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "title", "production code", "no in series" FROM public.modern_family_season_2 WHERE "title" ILIKE '%halloween%';
- Result:
  title: halloween
  production code: 2arg09
  no in series: 30

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “halloween have production code 2arg09 and be number 47 in the series.”
  - Production code = 2arg09: Supported by the data (matches exactly).
  - Number in series = 47: Contradicted by the data (database shows 30).

Conclusion
- The claim is a mix of true and false elements: the production code is correct, but the series number is not.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “halloween” as the episode title stored in the available dataset (Modern Family Season 2). The title is stored in lowercase as “halloween,” matched case-insensitively.
