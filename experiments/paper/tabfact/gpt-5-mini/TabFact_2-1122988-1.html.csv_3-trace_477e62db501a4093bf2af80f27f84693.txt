What was checked
- Claim interpreted as: “The least laps for Christian Danner when the grid is 5 is 43,” checked against the available race table for the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix.
- Dataset available: one table covering the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix with columns [driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid].

Evidence from data
1) Locate Christian Danner’s row(s)
SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired", grid
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
WHERE driver ILIKE '%Danner%';
Result:
- driver: christian danner | constructor: zakspeed | laps: 3 | time / retired: engine | grid: 23

2) Compute minimum laps for Christian Danner when grid = 5
SQL:
SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
WHERE lower(driver) = 'christian danner' AND grid = 5;
Result: min_laps = NULL (no matching rows; Danner did not start from grid 5 in this table)

3) Check who started from grid = 5 and how many laps they completed
SQL:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired", grid
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
WHERE grid = 5;
Result:
- driver: michele alboreto | constructor: ferrari | laps: 43 | time / retired: engine | grid: 5

Assessment
- There is no record of Christian Danner with grid = 5 in the available dataset; thus a “least laps” value for Danner at grid 5 cannot be 43 (it is undefined in this data). 
- The value 43 laps corresponds to Michele Alboreto (not Danner) starting from grid 5 in this race.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the available table.

Assumptions
- “Least lap” was interpreted as the minimum value in the “laps” column (laps completed) within the provided table.
- Name matching was done case-insensitively due to lowercase storage of names.
- Verification is constrained to the single available dataset (1987 Hungarian Grand Prix).
