Conclusion: Verified by data in the available Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season table. Three games at the US Airways Center share the same recorded attendance (18,422); a fourth US Airways Center game has no attendance listed.

Key evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect all rows to see venue/attendance formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season ORDER BY game;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- game=75, date=april 1, team=houston, location attendance="us airways center 18422"
- game=76, date=april 3, team=sacramento, location attendance="us airways center 18422"
- game=81, date=april 13, team=memphis, location attendance="us airways center 18422"
- game=82, date=april 15, team=golden state, location attendance="us airways center" (no number)

2) Count how many US Airways Center games share each attendance value (excluding missing attendance)
Executed SQL:
SELECT substring("location attendance" FROM '([0-9]+)$') AS attendance, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE 'us airways center%' AND substring("location attendance" FROM '([0-9]+)$') IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY attendance
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result:
- attendance: 18422 — cnt: 3

3) List the specific games at the US Airways Center with attendance 18422
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%US Airways Center%' AND "location attendance" ILIKE '%18422%';
Result:
- game: 75, date: april 1, team: houston, location attendance: us airways center 18422
- game: 76, date: april 3, team: sacramento, location attendance: us airways center 18422
- game: 81, date: april 13, team: memphis, location attendance: us airways center 18422

4) Total number of rows at US Airways Center (context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_us_airways
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%US Airways Center%';
Result:
- count_us_airways: 4

Assessment:
- Of the four US Airways Center entries in this dataset, three have the identical attendance value 18,422, and one lacks an attendance number. This supports the claim that three of the games at the US Airways Center have the same attendance.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to games as represented in the available table public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.
- Venue matching was case-insensitive, treating any value starting with/containing "us airways center" as the same venue.
- Attendance was parsed as the trailing numeric token in the "location attendance" text; rows without a trailing number were considered missing and excluded from “same attendance” comparisons.
