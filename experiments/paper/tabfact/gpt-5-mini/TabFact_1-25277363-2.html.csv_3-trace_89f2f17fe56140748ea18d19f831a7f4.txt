Summary of verification steps:
1) Discovered available data sources.
- Tool: Discover Data Sources
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public containing table full_house_season_7.

2) Inspected schema of the available table.
- Tool: Schema Query
- Result: Table public.full_house_season_7 with columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text).

3) Queried for any episode titled "Fast Friend(s)" and its original air date.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "title", "original air date" FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Fast Friend%';
- Query result:
  • title: fast friends
  • original air date: october 12 , 1993

Assessment of the claim: "fast friend originally air on october11 , 1992"
- Title: The database shows the episode title as "fast friends" (plural), not "fast friend" (singular).
- Air date: The database shows the original air date as October 12, 1993, not October 11, 1992.

Conclusion: Both the title (pluralization) and the air date (day, month/day, and year) differ from the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "fast friend" as referring to the Full House Season 7 episode titled "fast friends," given the available dataset only contains Full House Season 7 episodes.
