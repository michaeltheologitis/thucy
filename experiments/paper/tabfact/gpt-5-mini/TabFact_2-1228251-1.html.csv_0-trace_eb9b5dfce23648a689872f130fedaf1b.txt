Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with a single table in the public schema.

Step 2: Inspect schema
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Findings:
  - Database: TabFact (public)
  - Table: bruce_halford
  - Columns: year (bigint), entrant (text), chassis (text), engine (text), points (bigint)
  - No keys or FKs defined

Step 3: Verify the claim against data
Claim interpreted: The engine “climax straight - 4” is associated with the chassis Lotus 16, Cooper T45, and Cooper T51 in the available data.

Evidence queries and results:
1) Identify how the engine text appears (to handle spacing/case correctly)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT engine FROM public.bruce_halford WHERE engine ILIKE '%climax%';
Result:
[{"engine":"climax straight - 4"}]

2) Retrieve distinct chassis where the engine matches “Climax Straight-4” (case-insensitive, allowing optional spaces around hyphen)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT chassis FROM public.bruce_halford WHERE engine ~* 'climax\s*straight\s*-?\s*4';
Result:
[{"chassis":"cooper t45"},{"chassis":"cooper t51"},{"chassis":"lotus 16"}]

Assessment:
- The database shows that the engine labeled “climax straight - 4” is indeed associated with the chassis: Lotus 16, Cooper T45, and Cooper T51. This directly supports the user’s statement.

Assumptions:
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the associations present in the available TabFact.bruce_halford table (i.e., that within this dataset, entries with engine “climax straight - 4” include those chassis). I did not interpret the claim as asserting exclusivity beyond this dataset.
