Scope and interpretation
- Interpreted claim: “The Wildcats kept the opposing team scoreless in 4 games.” I looked for authoritative data about a team named “Wildcats” available in the connected data sources and found a table for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team. I verified whether that team recorded 4 shutouts (opponents scored 0) during that season.

Data discovery
- Available source discovered: PostgreSQL instance for the TabFact dataset (public schema) with table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

Relevant schema
- Table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), wildcats points (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

Evidence
1) Count of games with opponents scoring 0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS zero_opponent_games_count FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE "opponents" = 0;
- Result:
zero_opponent_games_count = 4

2) List of those games
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "game", "date", "opponent", "result", "wildcats points", "opponents", "record" FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE "opponents" = 0 ORDER BY "game";
- Result rows:
  • game: 2 | date: sept 27 | opponent: cincinnati | result: win | wildcats points: 20 | opponents: 0 | record: 1 - 1
  • game: 4 | date: oct 11 | opponent: 9 georgia | result: win | wildcats points: 26 | opponents: 0 | record: 3 - 1 , 20
  • game: 5 | date: oct 18 | opponent: 10 vanderbilt | result: win | wildcats points: 14 | opponents: 0 | record: 4 - 1 , 14
  • game: 9 | date: nov 15 | opponent: evansville | result: win | wildcats points: 36 | opponents: 0 | record: 7 - 2

Conclusion
- The connected data shows the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team shut out their opponents in 4 games, which matches the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions
- “Wildcat” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team, specifically the 1947 season, because this is the only accessible Wildcats dataset discovered.
- “Keep the opposing team scoreless” is interpreted as games where the “opponents” points column equals 0 (shutouts).
