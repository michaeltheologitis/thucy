Interpretation of the claim: I interpret “there be more than one be station” as asserting that there is more than one Bell Media station in the available dataset of media stations (Kelowna).

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner)

Evidence gathered:
1) Retrieved all rows to understand the dataset
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT * FROM media_in_kelowna;

2) Counted Bell Media-owned stations (case-insensitive match on owner field)
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT count(*) AS bell_count FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(owner) LIKE '%bell media%';
   - Result: bell_count = 2

3) Listed the Bell Media-owned stations for verification
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT "call sign" AS call_sign, branding FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(owner) LIKE '%bell media%' ORDER BY "call sign";
   - Results:
     1) call_sign = chsu - fm, branding = 99.9 sun fm
     2) call_sign = cilk - fm, branding = 101.5 ez rock

Conclusion:
- There are 2 Bell Media stations in the dataset, which is more than one. Under this interpretation, the claim holds true.

Assumptions made:
- “be station” refers to a Bell Media-owned station.
- Scope is limited to the TabFact public media_in_kelowna table (media stations in Kelowna).
