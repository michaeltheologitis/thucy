Claim to verify: “the bobcat have a record of 3 win and 7 loss.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public, containing one table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season. Columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record.

What I checked
- I interpreted “bobcat” as the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA) and searched the season table available. I looked for any row where the season record equals 3 wins and 7 losses (accounting for dash variants and spacing) and also performed broader searches. I also profiled the table to understand its coverage.

Evidence (exact SQL and results)
1) Count rows in the table
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result:
[{"total_rows":10}]

2) Distinct record values present (format inspection)
SQL:
SELECT record, count(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season GROUP BY record ORDER BY cnt DESC, record LIMIT 50;
Result:
[{"cnt":1,"record":"24 - 23"},{"cnt":1,"record":"24 - 24"},{"cnt":1,"record":"24 - 25"},{"cnt":1,"record":"25 - 25"},{"cnt":1,"record":"26 - 25"},{"cnt":1,"record":"26 - 26"},{"cnt":1,"record":"27 - 26"},{"cnt":1,"record":"27 - 27"},{"cnt":1,"record":"27 - 28"},{"cnt":1,"record":"27 - 29"}]

3) Check for an exact 3-7 record, normalizing dash types but not removing spaces
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE translate(trim(record), '–—', '--') = '3-7';
Result:
match_count = 0

4) Robust equality check for 3 wins and 7 losses (remove spaces and normalize dashes)
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE regexp_replace(regexp_replace(record, '\\s', '', 'g'), '[–—]', '-', 'g') = '3-7';
Result:
No rows returned

5) Broader containment search for any normalized record containing the sequence 3-7
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, record, regexp_replace(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g') AS normalized_record
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE regexp_replace(regexp_replace(record, E'–', '-', 'g'), '[^0-9-]', '', 'g') LIKE '%3-7%';
Result:
No rows returned

6) Verify coverage by parsing records and checking minimum wins/losses, plus earliest game number
SQL (rows matching numeric W-L pattern):
SELECT count(*) AS parsed_rows FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE record ~ '^\\s*\\d+\\s*-\\s*\\d+\\s*$';
Result:
[{"parsed_rows":10}]

SQL (minimum wins and losses parsed from record):
SELECT MIN( (trim(split_part(record,'-',1)))::int ) AS min_wins, MIN( (trim(split_part(record,'-',2)))::int ) AS min_losses FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE record ~ '^\\s*\\d+\\s*-\\s*\\d+\\s*$';
Result:
[{"min_losses":23,"min_wins":24}]

SQL (earliest game number present):
SELECT MIN(game) AS earliest_game FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result:
[{"earliest_game":47}]

Findings
- Within the available Charlotte Bobcats season data (10 rows covering games from at least game 47 onward), there is no evidence that the team ever had a record of 3 wins and 7 losses. The smallest record present is 24 - 23, far from 3 - 7.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative data, the claim is not supported.

Assumptions
- “Bobcat” refers to the Charlotte Bobcats (NBA). The only accessible dataset pertains to their 2009–10 season and contains a mid-season slice (earliest game #47). I treat this dataset as authoritative within its scope, per instructions.
