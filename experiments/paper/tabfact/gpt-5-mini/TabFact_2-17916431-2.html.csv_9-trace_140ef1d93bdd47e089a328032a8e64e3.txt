Claim to verify: “Bradford City go against Port Vale 2 times according to the chart, on 13 September 2008 and 28 March 2009.”

What I checked
- Located a season table for Bradford City’s 2008–09 fixtures/results.
- Queried for all matches where the opponent is Port Vale and reviewed the dates.
- Counted the number of such matches.

Evidence from the database
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact22), schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (columns: game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance)

Evidence query 1 (list the Port Vale matches)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Port Vale%'
ORDER BY game;

Returned rows:
1) game: 5, date: 6 september 2008, opponent: port vale, venue: away, result: 2 - 0, attendance: 7273
2) game: 39, date: 21 march 2009, opponent: port vale, venue: home, result: 0 - 1, attendance: 12436

Evidence query 2 (confirm the count of Port Vale matches)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
WHERE lower(opponent) = lower('Port Vale');

Result:
match_count: 2

Findings
- Bradford City played Port Vale twice in the 2008–09 season (verified by count = 2).
- The actual dates in the table are 6 September 2008 (away) and 21 March 2009 (home).
- The claimed dates (13 September 2008 and 28 March 2009) do not match the data.

Conclusion
- The number of meetings (two) is correct, but both dates in the claim are incorrect. Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- The referenced “chart” corresponds to the public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season table in the available database.
- Opponent matching was done case-insensitively to account for casing in the data.
