Claim interpreted: Katee Shean and Joshua Allen danced to “Filet from Le Rêve,” and that routine was choreographed by Tyce DiOrio.

Findings:
- True: Katee Shean and Joshua Allen did perform a routine to “Filet from Le Rêve.”
- False: That “Filet from Le Rêve” routine was not choreographed by Tyce DiOrio; it was choreographed by Jason Gilkison.
- Related context: Tyce DiOrio did choreograph a different routine for Katee and Joshua—specifically a contemporary piece to “All By Myself” by Celine Dion.

Supporting data (from TabFact public PostgreSQL database):
1) Locate the canonical couple name value in the table
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT couple FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 WHERE couple ILIKE '%Katee%';

2) Retrieve all performances for that couple
SQL executed:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE couple = 'katee shean joshua allen';

Returned rows relevant to the claim:
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: paso doble | music: filet from le rêve | choreographer(s): jason gilkison | results: safe
- couple: katee shean joshua allen | style: contemporary | music: all by myself - celine dion | choreographer(s): tyce diorio | results: safe

Conclusion: The choreographer attribution in the claim is incorrect. The “Filet from Le Rêve” paso doble was by Jason Gilkison, not Tyce DiOrio.

Assumptions:
- “be choreograph by tyce diorio” is interpreted as asserting that Tyce DiOrio choreographed the “Filet from Le Rêve” routine.
- Name spellings and accents follow the database (e.g., “le rêve,” lowercase couple identifier).
