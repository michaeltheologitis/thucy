Claim interpreted: The match in South Dakota, United States had Brian Dunn as the opponent and had 3 rounds.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact28 (public schema)
- Table identified: public.brad_gumm

Table schema (public.brad_gumm):
- res (text)
- record (text)
- opponent (text)
- method (text)
- event (text)
- round (bigint)
- location (text)

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location
FROM public.brad_gumm
WHERE trim(opponent) ILIKE 'Brian Dunn' OR trim(opponent) ILIKE '%Brian Dunn%';

- Result:

  - record: 5 - 1 - 1
  - opponent: brian dunn
  - method: submission (rear naked choke)
  - event: msf - total destruction
  - round: 2
  - location: south dakota , united states

Findings mapped to the claim:
- Opponent is Brian Dunn: Supported (opponent = brian dunn).
- Location is South Dakota, United States: Supported (location = "south dakota , united states").
- The match had 3 rounds: Not supported by the data. The dataset’s round field for this bout is 2, indicating the fight ended in round 2.

Conclusion: The claim is partly incorrect. While the opponent and location are correct, the number of rounds is not—this bout ended in round 2, not 3.

Assumptions and notes:
- Interpreted the user’s claim within the context of the available dataset (Brad Gumm’s bout records). The fight referenced is Brad Gumm vs. Brian Dunn at “MSF - Total Destruction.”
- The round field is taken as the round in which the bout concluded, which is the convention in such records. No column for scheduled rounds is present in the dataset.
