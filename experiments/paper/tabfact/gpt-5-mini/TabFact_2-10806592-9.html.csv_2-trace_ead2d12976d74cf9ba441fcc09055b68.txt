Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (public schema) with table public.t_1938_vfl_season (1938 VFL season). Columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date" (dates stored as text; scores stored as strings like “16.25 (121)”).

Evidence
1) List all matches recorded on 18 June (broad text match)
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date"
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%18%' AND date ILIKE '%June%';
Results (rows):
- geelong | 11.23 (89) | hawthorn | 6.13 (49) | corio oval | 7000 | 18 june 1938
- fitzroy | 16.12 (108) | south melbourne | 8.8 (56) | brunswick street oval | 12000 | 18 june 1938
- st kilda | 14.12 (96) | melbourne | 16.16 (112) | junction oval | 14000 | 18 june 1938

- north melbourne | 11.5 (71) | carlton | 16.25 (121) | arden street oval | 13000 | 18 june 1938

2) Confirm the same set precisely by date
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season WHERE lower(date) = '18 june 1938';
Results: Same six rows as above.

3) Compute the highest-scoring team on that date (parse numeric points from parentheses)
SQL executed:
SELECT team, points, opponent, venue, date FROM (
  SELECT date, venue, "home team" as team, CAST(trim(both '()' FROM split_part("home team score",' ',2)) AS integer) as points, "away team" as opponent
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE lower(date) = '18 june 1938'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT date, venue, "away team" as team, CAST(trim(both '()' FROM split_part("away team score",' ',2)) AS integer) as points, "home team" as opponent
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE lower(date) = '18 june 1938'
) t
ORDER BY points DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- team: carlton, points: 121, opponent: north melbourne, venue: arden street oval, date: 18 june 1938
