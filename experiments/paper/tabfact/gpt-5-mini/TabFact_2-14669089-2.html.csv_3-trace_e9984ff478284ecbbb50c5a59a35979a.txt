Claim to verify: “At 459 feet, the Schiesinger [Schlesinger] Building is the fourth largest [tallest] building in Johannesburg.”

Data source discovered
- Database: postgres_tabfact20 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa (name text, city text, years as tallest text, metres double precision, feet bigint, floors bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Johannesburg buildings by height (feet), ranked
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, city, metres, feet, floors, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY feet DESC) AS johannesburg_rank
  FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
  WHERE city ILIKE '%johannesburg%'
  ORDER BY feet DESC;
- Result (abridged):
  1) Carlton Centre — 732 ft / 223 m (rank 1)
  2) Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1 , Trust Bank Building — 459 ft / 140 m (rank 2)
  3) Standard Bank Building — 455 ft / 138.8 m (rank 3)
  4) Schlesinger Building — 361 ft / 110 m (rank 4)
  5) Chamber of Mines Building — 262 ft / 80 m (rank 5)

2) Direct lookup of Schlesinger Building details
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, city, metres, feet, floors
  FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
  WHERE name ILIKE '%schles%';
- Result: schlesinger building — Johannesburg — 361 ft / 110 m

3) Confirm Schlesinger’s rank by height within Johannesburg
- SQL executed:
  WITH ranks AS (
    SELECT *, rank() OVER (PARTITION BY city ORDER BY feet DESC) AS rank_by_height
    FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
    WHERE city ILIKE 'johannesburg'
  )
  SELECT *
  FROM ranks
  WHERE name ILIKE '%schlesinger%';
- Result: rank_by_height = 4; feet = 361; metres = 110; floors = 21

4) Cross-check by number of floors (optional confirmation)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, floors, feet, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY floors DESC) AS floor_rank
  FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
  WHERE city ILIKE 'Johannesburg'
  ORDER BY floors DESC, name;
- Result (abridged):
  1) Carlton Centre — 50 floors (732 ft)
  2) Standard Bank Building — 34 floors (455 ft)
  3) Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1 , Trust Bank Building — 31 floors (459 ft)
  4) Schlesinger Building — 21 floors (361 ft)
  5) Chamber of Mines Building — 18 floors (262 ft)

Assessment
- Height: The claim states 459 feet for the Schlesinger Building. Data shows the Schlesinger Building is 361 feet (110 m). The 459-foot figure corresponds to the Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1 / Trust Bank Building, not Schlesinger.
- Rank within Johannesburg: The Schlesinger Building is the 4th tallest in Johannesburg in this dataset, which aligns with the “fourth largest [tallest]” portion of the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes accurate and inaccurate elements: correct rank (4th), incorrect height (it is 361 ft, not 459 ft). Therefore, the overall claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “largest” to mean tallest by height in feet.
- Treated “Schiesinger” as a misspelling of “Schlesinger.”
- Used case-insensitive matching for city = Johannesburg and building name.
- Relied on the table list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa as the authoritative dataset for this verification.
