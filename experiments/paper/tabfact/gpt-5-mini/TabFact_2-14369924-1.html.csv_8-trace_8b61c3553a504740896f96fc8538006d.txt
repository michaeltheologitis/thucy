Claim to verify: “the erp w and the class for w230av in gadsden , alabama be the same erp w and class for w290ag in griffin , georgia.”

Conclusion: The station class matches for both, but the ERP (W) does not. Therefore, the overall claim (both ERP and class are the same) is not supported.

Evidence from data
- Source: Database TabFact (postgres_tabfact11), schema public, table wyfk (columns: "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "fcc info").

Executed SQL and results:
1) Search by city of license (case-insensitive) to capture possible lowercase call signs:
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "fcc info"
FROM wyfk
WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%gadsden%'
   OR "city of license" ILIKE '%griffin%';

Results:
- call sign: w230av; frequency mhz: 93.9 fm; city of license: gadsden , alabama; erp w: 10; class: d; fcc info: fcc
- call sign: w290ag; frequency mhz: 105.9 fm; city of license: griffin , georgia; erp w: 27; class: d; fcc info: fcc

Interpretation of results:
- W230AV (Gadsden, Alabama): ERP = 10 W, Class = d
- W290AG (Griffin, Georgia): ERP = 27 W, Class = d
- ERP comparison: 10 W vs 27 W → not the same
- Class comparison: d vs d → the same

Optional discovery steps (no matching rows, shown for completeness):
- Direct call sign match attempts returned no rows when using exact uppercase spelling; this is consistent with the data storing call signs in lowercase.
  a) SELECT "call sign", "erp w", "class", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'W230AV';
  b) SELECT "call sign", "erp w", "class", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'W290AG';

Answer: The classes match (both d), but the ERP values differ (10 W vs 27 W). Thus, the claim that both ERP and class are the same is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “erp w” is interpreted as effective radiated power in watts.
- Station class values are taken directly from the "class" field (both listed as "d").
- The database table wyfk is treated as authoritative for this verification and stores call signs in lowercase, which is why city-based search was used to retrieve the correct rows.
