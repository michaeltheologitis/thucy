Interpretation of the request
- I interpreted your request as: “List players whose round is strictly greater than 4 and whose nationality is either Canada or the United States.”
- Data source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema). Relevant table: public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season.

Schema grounding
- Table public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season columns used: round (bigint), player (text), nationality (text), nhl team (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total rows and distinct nationalities
- Purpose: Confirm how the countries are represented textually in the data.
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season;
Result:
- total_rows: 10

SQL executed:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY cnt DESC, nationality;
Results:
- canada — 7
- united states — 2
- sweden — 1

2) Round column characteristics
- Purpose: Ensure round is numeric and determine valid filtering for round > 4.
SQL executed:
SELECT round, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season GROUP BY round ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Results:
- 5 — 2
- 4 — 2
- 2 — 2
- 7 — 2
- 3 — 1
- 1 — 1

SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season' AND column_name='round';
Result:
- column_name: round, data_type: bigint

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, SUM(CASE WHEN round IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season;
Result:
- total_rows: 10, null_count: 0

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_gt_4 FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season WHERE round > 4;
Result:
- count_gt_4: 4

3) Final selection: players in round > 4 and nationality in Canada or United States
SQL executed:
SELECT player, round, nationality, "nhl team" 
FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season
WHERE round > 4
  AND lower(nationality) IN ('canada', 'united states');
Results:
- linden rowat (g), round: 5, nationality: canada, nhl team: los angeles kings
- joshua turnbull (c), round: 5, nationality: united states, nhl team: los angeles kings
- josh kidd (d), round: 7, nationality: canada, nhl team: los angeles kings
- matt fillier (lw), round: 7, nationality: canada, nhl team: los angeles kings

Conclusion
- The players listed above satisfy both conditions: round strictly greater than 4 and nationality either Canada or United States, as verified directly from the table.

Assumptions
- “Round higher than 4” interpreted as round > 4 (strictly greater than 4).
- “Be from” interpreted via the nationality column values.
- Country matching was case-insensitive but used the exact strings found in the data: “canada” and “united states”.
