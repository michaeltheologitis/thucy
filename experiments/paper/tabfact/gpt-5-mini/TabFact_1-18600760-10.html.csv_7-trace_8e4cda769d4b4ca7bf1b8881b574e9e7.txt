Claim to verify: “the geo id for dickey county be 3804740620.”

Summary conclusion: The value 3804740620 does not correspond to Dickey County. In the available data, 3804740620 is the GEOID for the “janke” township in Logan County, ND. For Dickey County, the county-level code indicated by the GEOID prefix in this dataset is 38021 (not 38047).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):

1) Identify how counties are named in the table
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota ORDER BY county;
- Result includes: dickey, logan, …

2) Inspect rows for county = 'dickey'
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county = 'dickey' LIMIT 20;
- Result (key fields):
  township: james river valley; county: dickey; geo id: 3802140540; ansi code: 1036767
  (Shows a Dickey County township with GEOID starting with 38021.)

3) Check the specific GEOID 3804740620
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE "geo id" = 3804740620;
- Result (key fields):
  township: janke; county: logan; geo id: 3804740620; ansi code: 1037193
  (This GEOID belongs to a township in Logan County.)

4) Derive the county FIPS/GEOID prefix used for Dickey from township GEOIDs
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING(("geo id")::text FROM 1 FOR 5) AS prefix
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE lower(county) = 'dickey'
ORDER BY prefix;
- Result: 38021
  (Indicates Dickey County’s 5-digit county prefix is 38021.)

5) Confirm the county implied by 3804740620 via its prefix
- SQL:
SELECT county, left(CAST("geo id" AS text), 5) AS first5_digits FROM public."list_of_townships_in_north_dakota" WHERE "geo id" = 3804740620;
- Result: county = logan; first5_digits = 38047
  (Prefix 38047 corresponds to Logan County.)

6) Cross-check Logan’s prefix directly
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT LEFT(CAST("geo id" AS text),5) AS first5
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE lower(county) = 'logan'
ORDER BY first5;
- Result: 38047

Assessment:
- The supplied value (3804740620) clearly maps to a township in Logan County (prefix 38047), not to Dickey County.
- The Dickey County prefix indicated by this dataset is 38021, aligning with the known 5-digit county FIPS/GEOID for Dickey County, ND.

Answer:
- The claim is incorrect. 3804740620 is not the GEOID for Dickey County; it is the GEOID of the Janke township in Logan County. The county-level code for Dickey County is 38021.

Assumptions:
- The table contains township (county subdivision) GEOIDs; the first five digits of these GEOIDs represent the state+county code (i.e., the county FIPS/GEOID). This is consistent with census GEOID construction for county subdivisions.
- “Geo id for Dickey County” is interpreted as the county-level GEOID/FIPS (5-digit), not a township-level GEOID.
