Claim interpreted: “South Korea get 2 gold award in total.” I verified this against the available authoritative data source (TabFact PostgreSQL, public schema), which contains a medal table for the 1967 World Judo Championships.

Evidence from data
- Data source: TabFact (PostgreSQL) → public.t_1967_world_judo_championships
- Query objective: Retrieve South Korea’s medal counts (gold, silver, bronze, total), allowing for naming variants and excluding North Korea.

Executed SQL (as returned by the tool):
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships
WHERE (
  LOWER(nation) LIKE '%korea%' AND LOWER(nation) NOT LIKE '%north%'
) OR LOWER(nation) = 'kor'
LIMIT 10;

Result returned:
[ { "nation": "south korea", "gold": 0, "silver": 1, "bronze": 2, "total": 3 } ]

Findings
- In the 1967 World Judo Championships table, South Korea has 0 gold medals, not 2. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Scope: I used the only available dataset exposed by the tools (the 1967 World Judo Championships medal table). If the claim intended a different event or a broader timeframe, that information is not present in the accessible data.
- Naming: I matched common variants for South Korea (e.g., containing “korea” but excluding “north”; also allowing “KOR”). No other matching entries appeared beyond “south korea.”
