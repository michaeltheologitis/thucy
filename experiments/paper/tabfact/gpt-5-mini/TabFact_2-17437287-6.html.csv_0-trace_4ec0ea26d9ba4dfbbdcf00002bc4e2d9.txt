Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to ground the verification in actual data.
- Queried the 1983–84 FA Cup matches table for a record where Birmingham City were the home team on 10 March 1984 and retrieved the recorded score.

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact26), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_84_fa_cup with columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text).

Evidence query and result
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date"
  FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup
  WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'Birmingham City'
    AND "date" ~* '10[^0-9A-Za-z]*mar(ch)?[^0-9A-Za-z]*1984';

- Query result:
  {"home team":"birmingham city", "score":"1 - 3", "away team":"watford", "date":"10 march 1984"}

Conclusion
- The data shows that on 10 March 1984, Birmingham City (home) played Watford (away) and the recorded score was 1 - 3. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- The date field is stored as text with varying capitalization, so a case-insensitive regex was used to match "10 March 1984".
- The match in question is contained within the 1983/84 FA Cup dataset available in this database, which we treat as authoritative per instructions.
