Claim to verify: "steve stricker of scotland have lower score than phil mickelson of united state"

Data sources discovered:
- One PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf (appears to store the 2006 U.S. Open golf leaderboard: place, player, country, score, to par).

Evidence query and results:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player,country,place,score,"to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Stricker%' OR player ILIKE '%Mickelson%';

- Returned rows:
  - player: steve stricker | country: united states | place: 1 | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | to par: - 1
  - player: phil mickelson | country: united states | place: t7 | score: 70 + 73 = 143 | to par: + 3

Assessment:
- Nationality:
  - The claim says "Steve Stricker of Scotland"; the data shows Steve Stricker’s country as "united states". This part of the claim is contradicted by the data.
  - The claim says "Phil Mickelson of United States"; the data shows "united states", which supports this part.
- Score comparison:
  - Steve Stricker’s total score listed: 139 (to par: -1).
  - Phil Mickelson’s total score listed: 143 (to par: +3).
  - Therefore, in this dataset (2006 U.S. Open), Steve Stricker has a lower score than Phil Mickelson. This supports the comparative part of the claim.

Conclusion: The nationality for Steve Stricker is incorrect, but the claim that he had a lower score than Phil Mickelson (in the 2006 U.S. Open table) is correct.

Assumptions made:
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the available dataset (2006 U.S. Open golf results) since this is the only accessible source.
- "Lower score" refers to the aggregate total shown in the score field (e.g., 139 vs 143) and is consistent with the "to par" values.
- Player matching used a case-insensitive search (ILIKE) to account for name casing in the table.
