Claim interpreted: “Grid position 1 has 105 laps and a ‘time / retired’ value of ‘+ 6.18’.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: postgres_tabfact16 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix with columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), "time / retired" (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence
1) What does the row with grid = 1 show?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" FROM t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 1;
- Result:
  - driver: graham hill | constructor: brm | laps: 5 | time / retired: distributor
- Finding: Grid 1 did not complete 105 laps, nor is its "time / retired" value "+ 6.18".

2) Who has 105 laps and what is their "time / retired" value?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, grid, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE laps = 105;
- Results:
  - lorenzo bandini | ferrari | grid: 7 | time / retired: 2:06:18.23
  - richie ginther | brm     | grid: 5 | time / retired: + 6.18
- Finding: The “+ 6.18” value belongs to the driver who started from grid 5 (Richie Ginther), not grid 1.

3) Direct check of grid = 5 (to confirm the +6.18 association)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" FROM t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 5;
- Result:
  - driver: richie ginther | constructor: brm | laps: 105 | time / retired: + 6.18

4) Additional checks for completeness (no matching rows)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 1 AND laps = 105;
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 1 AND "time / retired" LIKE '+ 6.18%';
- Result: No rows matched either condition.

Conclusion
- The data shows that grid position 1 corresponds to Graham Hill, who retired after 5 laps due to a distributor issue. The “+ 6.18” margin is associated with Richie Ginther from grid 5, who completed 105 laps. Therefore, the claim that grid 1 has 105 laps and a “time / retired” of “+ 6.18” is not supported.

Assumptions made
- “1 grid” is interpreted as grid position = 1.
- “105 lap” refers to laps = 105 in the laps column.
- “time / retire of + 6.18” refers to the exact value in the "time / retired" column being "+ 6.18".
