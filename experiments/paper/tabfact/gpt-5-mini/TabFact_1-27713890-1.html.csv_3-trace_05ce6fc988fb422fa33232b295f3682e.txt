Claim interpreted: “October 1, 1998 is the date that ‘The One with All the Resolutions’ originally aired.”

Findings grounded in data:
- The episode titled “The One with All the Resolutions” appears in the Friends season 5 dataset with an original air date of January 7, 1999 (not October 1, 1998).
- October 1, 1998 corresponds to a different episode: “the one with all the kissing.”

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Identify the episode and its original air date
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", "title", "original air date" 
FROM public.friends_season_5 
WHERE "title" ILIKE '%All the Resolutions%';

Result row:
{ "no in series": 108, "no in season": 11, "title": "the one with all the resolutions", "original air date": "january 7 , 1999" }

2) Check which episode aired in October 1998 (and specifically around October 1)
SQL:
SELECT "title", "no in season", "original air date"
FROM public.friends_season_5
WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%october%'
  AND "original air date" ILIKE '%1998%';

Result rows:
- the one with all the kissing — 2 — october 1 , 1998
- the one hundredth the one with the triplets — 3 — october 8 , 1998
- the one where phoebe hates pbs — 4 — october 15 , 1998
- the one with the kips — 5 — october 29 , 1998

Conclusion: The data shows “The One with All the Resolutions” originally aired on January 7, 1999. October 1, 1998 is the air date for “the one with all the kissing,” not “the one with all the resolutions.”

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Friends TV series episode titled “The One with All the Resolutions.”
- The TabFact public.friends_season_5 table is taken as authoritative. Dates are stored as text (lowercase, with a space before commas), so case-insensitive and substring matching were used where appropriate.
