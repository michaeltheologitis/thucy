Claim to verify: “the highest score for a winning team be 18 and the lowest score be 11.5.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available source: PostgreSQL TabFact database with table public.solheim_cup (contains year, venue, "winning team", score, "usa captain", "europe captain").
- Schema review confirmed: score is stored as text (e.g., "15–13", with possible half-points like "14½–13½").

Method
- Parse the left-hand number in the score text as the winning team’s score, normalizing en dash to hyphen and converting the half character (½) to .5, then cast to numeric to compute minima and maxima.

Evidence (executed SQL and returned results)
1) Inspect parsed winning scores for all rows
SQL executed:
SELECT year, "winning team", score,
       (replace(replace(split_part(replace(score, E'–', '-'), '-', 1), '½', '.5'), ' ', ''))::numeric AS win_score
FROM public.solheim_cup
ORDER BY year;

Returned rows (excerpt showing parsed win_score):
- year=1990, winning team=united states, score=11½ - 4½, win_score=11.5
- year=1992, winning team=europe, score=11½ - 6½, win_score=11.5
- year=1994, winning team=united states, score=13 - 7, win_score=13
- year=1996, winning team=united states, score=17 - 11, win_score=17
- year=1998, winning team=united states, score=16 - 12, win_score=16
- year=2000, winning team=europe, score=14½ - 11½, win_score=14.5
- year=2002, winning team=united states, score=15½ - 12½, win_score=15.5
- year=2003, winning team=europe, score=17½ - 10½, win_score=17.5
- year=2005, winning team=united states, score=15½ - 12½, win_score=15.5
- year=2007, winning team=united states, score=16 - 12, win_score=16
- year=2009, winning team=united states, score=16 - 12, win_score=16
- year=2011, winning team=europe, score=15 - 13, win_score=15
- year=2013, winning team=europe, score=18 - 10, win_score=18

2) Compute extrema of winning scores
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(win_score) AS max_winning_score, MIN(win_score) AS min_winning_score
FROM (
  SELECT (replace(replace(split_part(replace(score, E'–', '-'), '-', 1), '½', '.5'), ' ', ''))::numeric AS win_score
  FROM public.solheim_cup
) t;

Returned:
- max_winning_score = 18
- min_winning_score = 11.5

3) List rows achieving the extremes
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT year, "winning team", score,
         (replace(replace(split_part(replace(score, E'–', '-'), '-', 1), '½', '.5'), ' ', ''))::numeric AS win_score
  FROM public.solheim_cup
)
SELECT year, "winning team", score, win_score
FROM parsed
WHERE win_score = (SELECT MAX(win_score) FROM parsed)
   OR win_score = (SELECT MIN(win_score) FROM parsed)
ORDER BY win_score DESC, year;

Returned rows:
- year=2013, winning team=europe, score=18 - 10, win_score=18
- year=1990, winning team=united states, score=11½ - 4½, win_score=11.5
- year=1992, winning team=europe, score=11½ - 6½, win_score=11.5

Findings
- Highest winning team score in the dataset: 18.0 (Europe, 2013).
- Lowest winning team score in the dataset: 11.5 (United States, 1990; Europe, 1992).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data: highest = 18 and lowest = 11.5 for winning team scores in public.solheim_cup.

Assumptions
- “Winning team score” is the left-hand value in the score text field.
- Score text may contain an en dash (–) and the half character (½); both were normalized as shown in the SQL before numeric casting.
- The claim refers to the Solheim Cup results contained in the only available dataset (public.solheim_cup).
