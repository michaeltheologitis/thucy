Claim interpreted: Among players who scored over par (to-par > 0), a majority are from the United States.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money)

Key checks and evidence
1) Inspect distinct raw values of the to-par field
- Purpose: Understand formatting to normalize to numeric values.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "to par" FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY "to par" NULLS LAST LIMIT 100;
- Result examples: "- 1", "- 2", "+ 1", "+ 2", "+ 3", "e"

2) Distinct to-par values with normalization (E/e→0; remove spaces; handle unicode minus and leading +) and counts
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "to par" AS original,
       COUNT(*) AS count,
       CASE
         WHEN lower(regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace("to par", '−', '-'), chr(160), ''), ' ', ''), '^\+', '')) = 'e' THEN 0
         ELSE CASE WHEN regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace("to par", '−', '-'), chr(160), ''), ' ', ''), '^\+', '') ~ '^[-]?\d+$'
                   THEN CAST(regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace("to par", '−', '-'), chr(160), ''), ' ', ''), '^\+', '') AS integer)
                   ELSE NULL END
       END AS normalized_value
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY "to par"
ORDER BY normalized_value NULLS LAST, original;
- Result summary: values present were −2 (1 row), −1 (3), 0 via e (1), +1 (2), +2 (1), +3 (4)

3) Count players with over-par scores (normalized to-par > 0)
- Executed SQL:
WITH normalized AS (
  SELECT *,
    CASE
      WHEN lower(trim("to par")) = 'e' THEN 0
      ELSE
        CASE WHEN regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
             THEN CAST(regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') AS numeric)
             ELSE NULL
        END
    END AS to_par_num
  FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
)
SELECT count(*) AS total_over_par FROM normalized WHERE to_par_num > 0;
- Result: total_over_par = 7

4) Breakdown of over-par players by country
- Executed SQL:
WITH normalized AS (
  SELECT *,
    CASE
      WHEN lower(trim("to par")) = 'e' THEN 0
      ELSE
        CASE WHEN regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
             THEN CAST(regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') AS numeric)
             ELSE NULL
        END
    END AS to_par_num
  FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
)
SELECT country, count(*) AS count
FROM normalized
WHERE to_par_num > 0
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY count DESC, country;
- Result: united states = 5, japan = 1, spain = 1

5) United States share among over-par players
- Executed SQL:
WITH normalized AS (
  SELECT *,
    CASE
      WHEN lower(trim("to par")) = 'e' THEN 0
      ELSE
        CASE WHEN regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') ~ '^[+-]?[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$'
             THEN CAST(regexp_replace(replace(replace(replace(trim("to par"), '−','-'),'–','-'),' ',''), '^\+', '') AS numeric)
             ELSE NULL
        END
    END AS to_par_num
  FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
)
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(country) = 'united states' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS us_count,
  COUNT(*) AS total_over_par,
  100.0 * SUM(CASE WHEN lower(country) = 'united states' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(*),0) AS us_percentage
FROM normalized
WHERE to_par_num > 0;
- Result: us_count = 5; total_over_par = 7; us_percentage ≈ 71.43%

6) Listing of over-par players for transparency
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country, "to par" AS raw_to_par,
  CASE WHEN lower(trim("to par")) IN ('e') THEN 0 ELSE CAST(replace("to par",' ', '') AS INTEGER) END AS to_par_num
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE (CASE WHEN lower(trim("to par")) IN ('e') THEN 0 ELSE CAST(replace("to par",' ', '') AS INTEGER) END) > 0
ORDER BY to_par_num DESC, player;
- Result rows:
  - hubert green — united states — "+ 3" — 3
  - josé maría olazábal — spain — "+ 3" — 3
  - paul azinger — united states — "+ 3" — 3
  - tom kite — united states — "+ 3" — 3
  - peter jacobsen — united states — "+ 2" — 2
  - masashi ozaki — japan — "+ 1" — 1
  - scott simpson — united states — "+ 1" — 1

Conclusion
- Supported by the data in public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf: Among players who scored over par, 5 of 7 (71.43%) are from the United States. This constitutes a majority.

Assumptions
- Scope: The claim was evaluated on the available dataset t_1989_u_s_open_golf (1989 U.S. Open Golf). No other tournaments or years were accessible via the provided tools.
- Definition: “Score over par” means normalized to-par > 0. Value 'E'/'e' denotes even (0). Spaces between sign and digits were removed; leading '+' removed; any Unicode minus/en-dash normalized to '-'.
- Country matching: Case-insensitive exact match on the string "united states" for United States.
