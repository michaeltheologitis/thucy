Summary
- Claim interpreted: For the Tour du Haut Var (within the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup), the series leader is David Le Lay (FRA) and he is also the winner.
- Finding: The Tour du Haut Var entry shows winner Davide Rebellin (ITA) and series leader Rinaldo Nocentini (ITA). David Le Lay is not the series leader for that event and is not its winner.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact12)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup
- Columns: date (text), event (text), winner (text), team (text), series leader (text)

Evidence 1: Tour du Haut Var entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT event, winner, "series leader" FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE event ILIKE 'Tour du Haut Var';
Result:
- event: tour du haut var
- winner: davide rebellin ( ita )
- series leader: rinaldo nocentini ( ita )
Interpretation: For Tour du Haut Var, the winner is Davide Rebellin and the series leader is Rinaldo Nocentini, not David Le Lay.

Evidence 2: Where David Le Lay is series leader
Executed SQL (pre-check for exact stored form of the name):
SELECT DISTINCT "series leader" FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup;
Executed SQL (events with David Le Lay as series leader):
SELECT event, date, winner, "series leader"
FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup
WHERE "series leader" = 'david lelay ( fra )'
ORDER BY date;
Results:
1) event: trophée des grimpeurs | date: may 4 | winner: david lelay ( fra ) | series leader: david lelay ( fra )
2) event: grand prix de plumelec - morbihan | date: may 31 | winner: thomas voeckler ( fra ) | series leader: david lelay ( fra )
Interpretation: David Le Lay is series leader for some events (and winner of Trophée des Grimpeurs), but not for the Tour du Haut Var.

Conclusion
- The claim that series leader David Le Lay (FRA) is also the winner for the Tour du Haut Var is contradicted by the data. The Tour du Haut Var winner is Davide Rebellin (ITA) and the series leader is Rinaldo Nocentini (ITA).

Assumptions
- I interpret the claim as referring to the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup entry for Tour du Haut Var in the available dataset and to the stored name format 'david lelay ( fra )'.
