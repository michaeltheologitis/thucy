Summary
- I explored the available data sources and located a dedicated table for the 1981 Open Championship: public.t_1981_open_championship, which includes player, country, score, and related fields.

Key Evidence from SQL Queries
1) Count of distinct players by country
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS num_players
FROM t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY num_players DESC, country;

Result (country — number of distinct players):
- england — 5
- united states — 5
- australia — 2
- argentina — 1
- japan — 1
- new zealand — 1
- scotland — 1

2) Verification of table population
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1981_open_championship;
Result: 16

3) Distinct players listed for England and the United States
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY country, player;

Relevant rows returned:
- England: david jagger; howard clark; mark james; nick job; tony jacklin
- United States: arnold palmer; ben crenshaw; bill rogers; hal sutton (a); johnny miller

Conclusion
- The data show England has 5 distinct players and the United States has 5 distinct players in the 1981 Open Championship table. This directly supports the claim that both countries have the same number of players, with 5 each.

Assumptions
- “united state” in the claim refers to “United States.”
- “number of player” is interpreted as the count of distinct player names per country recorded in the table t_1981_open_championship.
- Country names are compared as stored (lowercase) in the dataset.
