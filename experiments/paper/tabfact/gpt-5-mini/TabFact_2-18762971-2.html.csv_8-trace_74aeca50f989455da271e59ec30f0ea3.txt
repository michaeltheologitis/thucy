Claim being checked: The matches on April 14, 2001 and February 24, 2001 were both victories.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: TabFact PostgreSQL (public schema). Relevant table found: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season.
- Table columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Step 1: Inspect date formatting and row availability
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season LIMIT 5;
Returned sample (5 rows):
1) "13 august 2000", wolverhampton wanderers, a, "1 - 1", 19086
2) "19 august 2000", huddersfield town, h, "2 - 3", 22704
3) "26 august 2000", grimsby town, a, "1 - 0", 7755
4) "28 august 2000", blackburn rovers, h, "1 - 1", 15646
5) "9 september 2000", wimbledon, h, "0 - 5", 15856
Observation: dates are stored as lowercase text in the form "D mmmm yyyy" (e.g., "14 april 2001").

Step 2: Locate the two specific dates
Executed SQL (broad search to confirm matches near those dates):
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
WHERE date ~ '24.*2001' OR date ~ '14.*2001'
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- {date: "14 april 2001", opponent: "crystal palace", venue: "h", result: "4 - 1"}
- {date: "24 february 2001", opponent: "preston north end", venue: "a", result: "0 - 2"}
- {date: "24 march 2001", opponent: "birmingham city", venue: "a", result: "2 - 1"}

Executed SQL (exact match on the two dates):
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
WHERE lower(date) IN ('24 february 2001','14 april 2001')
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- {date: "14 april 2001", opponent: "crystal palace", venue: "h", result: "4 - 1"}
- {date: "24 february 2001", opponent: "preston north end", venue: "a", result: "0 - 2"}

Interpretation of results:
- April 14, 2001 vs Crystal Palace (home): Result 4 - 1. This is a victory for Sheffield Wednesday.
- February 24, 2001 vs Preston North End (away): Result 0 - 2. This is a defeat for Sheffield Wednesday.

Conclusion: The statement that both matches were victories is not supported. One was a win (April 14), the other was a loss (February 24).

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to Sheffield Wednesday F.C.'s 2000–01 season (consistent with the table title) and defines "victory" from Sheffield Wednesday’s perspective.
- Date strings were matched exactly in lowercase as stored in the table.
