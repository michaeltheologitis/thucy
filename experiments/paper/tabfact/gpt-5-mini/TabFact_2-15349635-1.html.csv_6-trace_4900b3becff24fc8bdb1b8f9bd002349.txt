Claim interpreted: The second-place team has fewer points than the first-place team and they are separated by a 2-goal difference.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema) with table t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- Table columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text).

Evidence from data:
1) Check positions 1 and 2 values
Executed SQL:
SELECT position, team, points, played, "against", difference
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
WHERE position IN (1,2)
ORDER BY position;

Result:
- position 1: team = flamengo, points = 13, played = 8, against = 12, difference = 8
- position 2: team = fluminense, points = 13, played = 8, against = 15, difference = 10

2) Compute whether second has fewer points and the goal-difference gap
Executed SQL (step 1 of computation):
SELECT position, team, points, (regexp_replace(difference, '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'))::int AS gd
FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football
WHERE position IN (1,2)
ORDER BY position;

Returned:
- position=1, team=flamengo, points=13, gd=8
- position=2, team=fluminense, points=13, gd=10

Executed SQL (final computation):
SELECT first.team AS first_team, first.points AS first_points, first.gd AS first_gd,
       second.team AS second_team, second.points AS second_points, second.gd AS second_gd,
       (second.points < first.points) AS has_second_fewer_points,
       (first.gd - second.gd) AS gd_gap
FROM (SELECT team, points, (regexp_replace(difference, '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'))::int AS gd
      FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 1) first
CROSS JOIN (SELECT team, points, (regexp_replace(difference, '[^0-9-]', '', 'g'))::int AS gd
            FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 2) second;

Computed output:
- first_team: flamengo, first_points: 13, first_gd: 8
- second_team: fluminense, second_points: 13, second_gd: 10
- has_second_fewer_points: false
- gd_gap: -2 (absolute gap = 2; second has higher GD by 2)

Assessment:
- "Second team have less point than the first": Not supported. Both have 13 points.
- "Separated by a 2 goal difference": Supported if interpreted as the absolute difference between their goal differences. GDs are 8 and 10, a gap of 2.

Conclusion: The claim mixes one false and one true component; overall it does not hold as stated.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "second team" and "first" as positions 2 and 1 in t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- Treated the column "difference" as goal difference (GD), parsed to integer.
- Interpreted "separate by a 2 goal difference" as the absolute difference between their GD values equals 2.
- Used the only available standings table (1940 in Brazilian football) as the context due to lack of other accessible data sources.
