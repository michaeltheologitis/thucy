Claim to verify: “steve stricker have a score lower than phil mickelson.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: t_2006_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par). This table appears to contain player results for the 2006 U.S. Open golf event.

Evidence from data
- The table contains entries for both Steve Stricker and Phil Mickelson. We compared their scores and to-par values.

Executed SQL queries and results
1) Lookup rows for Steve Stricker and Phil Mickelson
SQL:
SELECT player, place, score, "to par"
FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Stricker%' OR player ILIKE '%Mickelson%';

Results:
- player: steve stricker | place: 1  | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | to par: - 1
- player: phil mickelson | place: t7 | score: 70 + 73 = 143 | to par: + 3

2) Parse numeric totals for score and to-par for direct comparison
SQL:
SELECT player, place, score, "to par",
CASE
 WHEN split_part(score,'=',2) ~ '^\s*[-+]?\d+(\.\d+)?\s*$' THEN trim(split_part(score,'=',2))::numeric
 WHEN score ~ '^\s*[-+]?\d+(\.\d+)?\s*$' THEN trim(score)::numeric
 WHEN score = 'E' THEN 0::numeric
 ELSE NULL END AS score_num,
CASE WHEN replace(trim("to par"),' ','') ~ '^[-+]?\d+(\.\d+)?$' THEN replace(trim("to par"),' ','')::numeric WHEN "to par" = 'E' THEN 0::numeric ELSE NULL END AS to_par_num
FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Stricker%' OR player ILIKE '%Mickelson%';

Parsed results:
- Steve Stricker: score_num = 139, to_par_num = -1
- Phil Mickelson: score_num = 143, to_par_num = 3

Conclusion
- In the 2006 U.S. Open (as represented by this dataset), Steve Stricker’s total strokes (139) are lower than Phil Mickelson’s (143), and his to-par (−1) is lower than Mickelson’s (+3). This supports the claim in this context.

Assumptions
- “Score lower than” is interpreted within the only available golf dataset (the 2006 U.S. Open table) and refers to lower total strokes; to-par values are provided as corroboration.
- Name matching used case-insensitive contains logic for “Stricker” and “Mickelson.”
