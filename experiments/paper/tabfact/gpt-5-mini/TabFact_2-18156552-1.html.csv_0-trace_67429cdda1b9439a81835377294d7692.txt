Summary of verification:
- Claim: "ngc 1796 have the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 follow by ngc 1705 with 12.8"
- Finding: In the available Dorado Group dataset, NGC 1796 has the highest apparent magnitude (12.9), and NGC 1705 is next (12.8) when ordering by apparent magnitude descending (largest numeric value first).

Evidence from data
Data source discovery:
- Accessible source: TabFact/Postgres connector (postgres_tabfact9), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.dorado_group with columns: name (text), type (text), ra ( j2000 ) (text), dec ( j2000 ) (text), redshift (km / s ) (text), apparent magnitude (double precision).

Executed SQL and results:
1) Ordered apparent magnitudes (largest first)
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" DESC NULLS LAST;
Results (top to bottom):
- name: ngc 1796, apparent magnitude: 12.9
- name: ngc 1705, apparent magnitude: 12.8
- name: ngc 2082, apparent magnitude: 12.6
- name: ngc 1688, apparent magnitude: 12.6
- name: ic 2056, apparent magnitude: 12.5
- name: ngc 1596, apparent magnitude: 12.1
- name: ngc 1515, apparent magnitude: 12.1
- name: ngc 1546, apparent magnitude: 11.8
- name: ngc 1533, apparent magnitude: 11.7
- name: ngc 1947, apparent magnitude: 11.7
- name: ngc 1543, apparent magnitude: 11.5
- name: ngc 1617, apparent magnitude: 11.4
- name: ngc 1574, apparent magnitude: 11.4
- name: ngc 1559, apparent magnitude: 11.0
- name: ngc 1549, apparent magnitude: 10.7
- name: ngc 1566, apparent magnitude: 10.3
- name: ngc 1672, apparent magnitude: 10.3
- name: ngc 1553, apparent magnitude: 10.3

2) Row count (for context)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM public.dorado_group;
Result:
- total_count: 18

Conclusion:
- Within the public.dorado_group dataset, NGC 1796 has the numerically largest apparent magnitude (12.9), and NGC 1705 is second (12.8). This directly supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions:
- "Largest apparent magnitude" is interpreted as the numerically largest magnitude value, not brightness. Verification is confined to the public.dorado_group table in the available data source.
