Claim interpreted: The teams in positions 1 and 2 have different point totals, with the 2nd place team trailing by 2 points.

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact26, public schema) with a single table: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.

Step 2: Inspect schema to ground the analysis
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Target: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
- Schema summary:
  - Columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text)
  - No primary key reported.
  - Relevant fields for the claim: position, team, points.

Step 3: Retrieve points for positions 1 and 2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT position, team, points FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position IN (1,2) ORDER BY position;
- Result:
  [{"position":1,"team":"flamengo","points":13},{"position":2,"team":"fluminense","points":13}]

Step 4: Compute the points gap (leader minus second place)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT t1.points - t2.points AS points_difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football t1 JOIN public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football t2 ON true WHERE t1.position = 1 AND t2.position = 2;
- Result:
  [{"points_difference":0}]

Findings:
- Position 1 (flamengo) has 13 points.
- Position 2 (fluminense) has 13 points.
- The gap between 1st and 2nd is 0 points, not 2; they have the same points.

Conclusion:
- The claim is not supported. The top two teams do not have different point totals, and the second-place team is not behind by 2 points.

Assumptions:
- "First 2 position" refers to rows where position = 1 and position = 2 in public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- The standings context for verification is the dataset available (Brazilian football, 1940), as no other data sources were accessible.
