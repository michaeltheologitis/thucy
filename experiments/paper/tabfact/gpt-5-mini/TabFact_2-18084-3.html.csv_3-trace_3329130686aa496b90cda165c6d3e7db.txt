Claim to verify: “bob beamon [is] the athlete who set his long jump record the longest time ago.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Accessible data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” (postgres_tabfact5), schema public.
- Relevant table (from schema inspection): long_jump(mark text, wind double precision, athlete text, nationality text, venue text, date text).

Verification approach:
- Parse the date strings stored in long_jump and identify which athlete’s performance is the earliest by date.
- Compare earliest date across all rows in the table to determine if it belongs to Bob Beamon.

Executed SQL evidence and results:
1) Inspect date formats in the table (to select an appropriate parsing method):
SQL:
SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM long_jump GROUP BY date ORDER BY cnt DESC, date LIMIT 200;
Result (abridged):
- august 30 , 1991 — 2
- april 2 , 1994 — 1
- july 18 , 1988 — 1
- july 18 , 1995 — 1
- june 2 , 2007 — 1
- june 7 , 2009 — 1
- may 22 , 1987 — 1
- may 24 , 2008 — 1
- october 18 , 1968 — 1

2) Identify the earliest parsed date and the associated athlete:
SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT athlete, mark, date AS raw_date,
         to_date(replace(date, ' , ', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')::date AS parsed_date
  FROM long_jump
)
SELECT athlete, mark, raw_date AS date, parsed_date,
       ( (SELECT MAX(parsed_date) FROM parsed) - parsed_date ) AS days_since
FROM parsed
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- athlete: bob beamon
- mark: 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a
- date: october 18 , 1968
- parsed_date: 1968-10-18
- days_since (relative to latest date in table): 14842

3) Confirm the latest parsed date used as the reference in (2):
SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT athlete, mark, date AS raw_date,
         to_date(replace(date, ' , ', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')::date AS parsed_date
  FROM long_jump
)
SELECT athlete, mark, raw_date AS date, parsed_date
FROM parsed
ORDER BY parsed_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- athlete: dwight phillips
- date: june 7 , 2009
- parsed_date: 2009-06-07

Conclusion:
- Within the authoritative long_jump table, the earliest recorded performance date is 1968-10-18 and belongs to Bob Beamon. Therefore, he is indeed the athlete in this dataset who set his long jump mark the longest time ago.

Answer: Verified.

Assumptions:
- “his long jump record” is interpreted as the long jump mark entries recorded in the long_jump table (i.e., notable top marks/records contained in this dataset), and “longest time ago” means the earliest date among all rows in that table.
- Date strings are consistently parsed using the observed format pattern and normalization shown in the queries above.
