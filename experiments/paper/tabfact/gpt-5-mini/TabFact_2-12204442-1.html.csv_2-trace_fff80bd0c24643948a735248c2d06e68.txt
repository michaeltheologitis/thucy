Claim interpreted: “king island's attraction open in 1999.” I interpret this as asserting that the Drop Tower: Scream Zone attraction at Kings Island opened in 1999.

Data source discovery:
- Connected asset: PostgreSQL instance “postgres_tabfact19 (TabFact)”. Only one visible table: public.drop_tower_scream_zone.

Schema inspected:
- Table public.drop_tower_scream_zone columns: park (text), tower height (text), drop height (text), speed (text), model (text), opened (text), height requirement (text).

Evidence queries and results:
1) Purpose: Locate any entry for Kings Island and see the opening year.
   SQL executed:
   SELECT park, opened FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE park ILIKE '%kings%' OR park ILIKE '%king island%';
   Result:
   - park: kings island — opened: 1999
   - park: kings dominion — opened: march 22 , 2003

2) Purpose: Retrieve the full record for the Kings Island entry to confirm the attraction context and opening year.
   SQL executed:
   SELECT * FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE park ILIKE '%Kings%';
   Result (full record as stored):
   {"drop height":"264feet", "height requirement":"inches (cm)", "model":"gyro drop", "opened":"1999", "park":"kings island", "speed":"67 mph", "tower height":"315feet"}

Analysis:
- The Kings Island entry in the drop_tower_scream_zone table clearly shows the attraction (a gyro drop tower) with opened = 1999. This directly supports the claim that Kings Island’s drop tower attraction opened in 1999.

Conclusion: The data confirms the claim as stated (allowing for minor spelling variation “king” vs “kings”).

Assumptions made:
- “king island” refers to the U.S. amusement park “Kings Island,” not the Australian island. The table in question specifically catalogs the Drop Tower: Scream Zone installations, making this interpretation appropriate.
- “attraction” refers to the drop tower ride at that park.
