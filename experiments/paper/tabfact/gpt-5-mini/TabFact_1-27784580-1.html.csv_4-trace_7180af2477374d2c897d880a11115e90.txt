3) Compute the rating for “suki to ietara iinoni”, the minimum rating across all episodes, and their difference (percentage points)
SQL 1 (episode-specific rating):
SELECT "ratings" AS rating_text,
CASE WHEN regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') = '' THEN NULL ELSE (regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'))::numeric END AS rating_numeric
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE lower("romanized title") = 'suki to ietara iinoni';
Result: rating_text = '17.4%', rating_numeric = 17.4

SQL 2 (minimum rating overall):
SELECT MIN(CASE WHEN regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') = '' THEN NULL ELSE (regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'))::numeric END) AS min_rating_numeric
FROM tsuki_no_koibito;
Result: min_rating_numeric = 13.4

SQL 3 (verification in one query):
SELECT
(specific.rating_numeric) AS episode_rating,
min_all.min_rating_numeric AS min_rating,
(specific.rating_numeric - min_all.min_rating_numeric) AS difference
FROM
(SELECT CASE WHEN regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') = '' THEN NULL ELSE (regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'))::numeric END AS rating_numeric
 FROM tsuki_no_koibito
 WHERE lower("romanized title") = 'suki to ietara iinoni'
 LIMIT 1) AS specific,
(SELECT MIN(CASE WHEN regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g') = '' THEN NULL ELSE (regexp_replace("ratings", '[^0-9.]', '', 'g'))::numeric END) AS min_rating_numeric FROM tsuki_no_koibito) AS min_all;
Result: episode_rating = 17.4, min_rating = 13.4, difference = 4.0

Assessment relative to the claim
- “suki to ietara iinoni” rating: 17.4%
- Lowest rating among titles: 13.4%
- Difference: 4.0 percentage points. This supports the claim that it is 4% higher.

Assumptions

- “Title” refers to an episode title in the tsuki_no_koibito table, which stores episode-level ratings.
- Case-insensitive match used for the romanized title.
