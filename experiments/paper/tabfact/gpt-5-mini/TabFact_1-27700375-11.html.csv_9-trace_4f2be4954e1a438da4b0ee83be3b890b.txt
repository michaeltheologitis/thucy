Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact15 (TabFact)
- Table: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
- Relevant columns: game, date, team, location attendance (contains venue text and attendance number)

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Quick inspection to understand the location/attendance field
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 50;
Returned (excerpt):
- {game:75, date:april 1, team:philadelphia, location attendance:wells fargo center 16695}
- {game:76, date:april 3, team:miami, location attendance:prudential center 18711}
- {game:77, date:april 5, team:minnesota, location attendance:prudential center 13461}
- {game:79, date:april 8, team:new york, location attendance:prudential center 18023}
- {game:81, date:april 11, team:charlotte, location attendance:prudential center 13853}

2) Parse numeric attendance and rank all games by attendance
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" AS location_attendance,
  NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]+', '', 'g'), '')::integer AS attendance_num,
  (LOWER("location attendance") LIKE '%prudential%') AS is_prudential
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
ORDER BY attendance_num DESC
LIMIT 10;
Key results (by attendance descending):
- game 76 vs miami at prudential center: attendance 18,711 (highest)
- game 79 vs new york at prudential center: attendance 18,023
- game 77 vs minnesota at prudential center: attendance 13,461

3) Specifically among Prudential Center games, order by attendance
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance",
       regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS digits,
       NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '') AS digits2,
       CASE WHEN NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '') IS NULL THEN NULL ELSE CAST(NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '') AS integer) END AS attendance_num
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE '%prudential%'
ORDER BY attendance_num DESC NULLS LAST;
Returned:
- vs miami: prudential center 18711 (highest at Prudential)
- vs new york: prudential center 18023
- vs charlotte: prudential center 13853
- vs minnesota: prudential center 13461

Conclusion
- The most highly attended game (overall and at Prudential Center) was against Miami, not Minnesota. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset: the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season table (t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season).
- "Most highly attended" was taken to mean the maximum recorded attendance in this table. Venue matching was done by substring "prudential" within the "location attendance" field.
