Interpretation of the claim: Interpreting the question as the claim: “Triston Grant played the same position as the other player drafted in his round.” Using the available Flyers 2004–05 season draft dataset, we check Triston Grant’s round and position, then compare with the other player(s) drafted in that same round by the Flyers.

Evidence from data
1) Identify Triston Grant’s round and position
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, round, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE player ILIKE 'Triston Grant';
- Result:
  • player: triston grant
  • round: 9
  • position: left wing

2) List all players drafted in round 9 and their positions
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE "round" = 9;
- Results:
  • triston grant — left wing
  • john carter — center

Analysis
- Triston Grant (round 9) is listed as a left wing.
- The other player drafted in round 9 (John Carter) is listed as a center.
- Therefore, Triston Grant did not play the same position as the other player drafted in his round.

Conclusion
- The claim that Triston Grant played the same position as the other player drafted in his round is not supported by the data; it is contradicted.

Assumptions
- The table public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season represents the Flyers’ draft picks for that season, with “round” indicating draft round and “player”/“position” reflecting the drafted players and their listed positions.
- “Other player drafted in his round” refers to the other Flyers pick in round 9 within this dataset.
