Data sources explored
- Postgres database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table discovered: public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team (columns: game, date, opponent, result, black knights points, opponents, record)

Evidence
1) Direct lookup of the Villanova game
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Villanova';

Result:
- game: 3
- date: sept 27
- opponent: villanova
- result: loss
- black knights points: 0
- opponents: 10
- record: 2 - 1

Interpretation: On Sept 27 (game 3), Army played Villanova and lost 0–10. The record shown for that row is 2 - 1.

2) Record progression around that date
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE game BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY game;

Results (ordered by game):
- Game 1 | sept 13 | holy cross | win | 44–7 | record: 1 - 0
- Game 2 | sept 20 | lehigh     | win | 54–32 | record: 2 - 0
- Game 3 | sept 27 | villanova  | loss | 0–10 | record: 2 - 1
- Game 4 | oct 4   | stanford   | loss | 14–67 | record: 2 - 2
- Game 5 | oct 11  | duke       | loss | 10–21 | record: 2 - 3

Conclusion
- The data confirms that on Sept 27 (1975 season), Army lost to Villanova and their record became 2 - 1 immediately after that game. The claim is supported.

Assumptions
- “Black Knight” refers to the Army Black Knights football team (the table name uses “Army Cadets,” but the columns reference “black knights points,” and Army’s nickname transitioned historically). The date is represented as text “sept 27” in the dataset and corresponds to the 1975 season indicated by the table name.
