Overview
- Claim: "In 1980 they finish with a record of 18 - 12 and receive the 11 seed."

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data: PostgreSQL database "TabFact" with public schema containing table: vcu_rams_men_s_basketball.
- Table schema (vcu_rams_men_s_basketball):
  - year (bigint)
  - record (text)
  - seed (bigint)
  - region (text)
  - results (text)

Evidence from data
1) Season record, seed, and tournament details for 1980
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, record, seed, region, results
  FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
  WHERE year = 1980;
- Result:
  - year: 1980
  - record: 18 - 12
  - seed: 12
  - region: east
  - results: l 72 - 86

Assessment of the claim
- "Finish with a record of 18 - 12" — Supported by data (record = 18 - 12).
- "Receive the 11 seed" — Contradicted by data (seed = 12, not 11).

Conclusion
- The claim mixes one correct element (record) with one incorrect element (seed). Therefore, the overall claim is not fully accurate.

Assumptions
- "They" is interpreted as the VCU Rams men's basketball team, based on the available data source (vcu_rams_men_s_basketball table).
