Summary of verification
- Claim: "the attendance in week 12 be higher than the attendance in week 6 and 13"

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact" (public schema).
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season with columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint). No PK/FK constraints reported.

Evidence and executed SQL
- Objective: Retrieve attendance for weeks 6, 12, and 13.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE week IN (6, 12, 13) ORDER BY week;
- Results:
  - Week 6: attendance 71009
  - Week 12: attendance 66875
  - Week 13: attendance 43475

Evaluation
- Week 12 (66875) vs Week 6 (71009): 66875 < 71009 → not higher.
- Week 12 (66875) vs Week 13 (43475): 66875 > 43475 → higher.
- Therefore, week 12 attendance is higher than week 13 but not higher than week 6. The claim that it is higher than both week 6 and week 13 is not fully supported.

Conclusion
- The claim is only partially true: week 12 > week 13, but week 12 is not > week 6.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season) as it is the only accessible table with week and attendance fields.
- “Attendance” is interpreted as the numeric values in the attendance column for each given week.
- Weeks are uniquely identified by the numeric values in the week column.
