Claim to verify: “In 2012, the Oakland Raiders lose to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15 - 0.”

Data sources consulted
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact2)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry (columns: year, date, winner, result, loser, location) — a table of Chiefs–Raiders game results.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Direct check for the claimed event (Chiefs 15–0 over Raiders at Arrowhead in 2012)
SQL:
SELECT count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry
WHERE year = 2012
  AND winner ILIKE '%Chiefs%'
  AND loser ILIKE '%Raiders%'
  AND result ~ '15\s*-\s*0'
  AND location ILIKE '%Arrowhead%';
Result:
match_count = 0
Interpretation: No 2012 entry matches a Chiefs 15–0 win over the Raiders at Arrowhead.

2) List all 2012 Chiefs–Raiders games to locate any 15–0 result
SQL:
SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser, location
FROM public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry
WHERE year = 2012
  AND ((winner ILIKE '%Chiefs%' AND loser ILIKE '%Raiders%')
       OR (winner ILIKE '%Raiders%' AND loser ILIKE '%Chiefs%'));
Results:
- date: october 28, location: arrowhead stadium, winner: oakland raiders, result: 26 - 16, loser: kansas city chiefs, year: 2012
- date: december 16, location: oco coliseum, winner: oakland raiders, result: 15 - 0, loser: kansas city chiefs, year: 2012
Interpretation: In 2012, the Raiders beat the Chiefs 26–16 at Arrowhead. The 15–0 game was in Oakland (O.co Coliseum), with the Raiders defeating the Chiefs.

Conclusion
- The claim is false. There was no 2012 game where the Chiefs shut out the Raiders 15–0 at Arrowhead. Instead:
  - At Arrowhead (Oct 28, 2012): Raiders 26–16 Chiefs (Raiders won).
  - The 15–0 score occurred at O.co Coliseum (Dec 16, 2012): Raiders 15–0 Chiefs (Raiders won).

Assumptions
- Case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) was used for team names and location.
- Score pattern matched with a regex allowing spaces around the hyphen.
- The public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry table is treated as authoritative for Chiefs–Raiders results.
