Claim interpretation: The phrase appears to assert that “Natalia Strelkova is not the woman who lost the skating championship.” I interpret “lose the skating championship” as finishing last at the event reflected in the available dataset (1979 World Figure Skating Championships – Ladies).

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships (columns: rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places)

Key evidence from the data
1) Full table contents (to see overall placements, winner, and last place)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
Result excerpt (rank | name | nation | points):
- 1 | linda fratianne | united states | 186.92
- …
- 13 | natalia strelkova | soviet union | 164.94
- …
- 31 | gloria mas | spain | 112.28

2) Natalia Strelkova’s placement
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Strelkova%';
Result:
- rank: 13 | name: natalia strelkova | nation: soviet union | sp + fs: 16 | points: 164.94 | places: 134

3) Winner (rank = 1)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = 1;
Result:
- rank: 1 | name: linda fratianne | nation: united states | sp + fs: 1 | points: 186.92 | places: 11

4) Last-place finisher (max rank)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships);
Result:
- rank: 31 | name: gloria mas | nation: spain | sp + fs: 31 | points: 112.28 | places: 279

Assessment
- Natalia Strelkova placed 13th, which is not last. Therefore, under the interpretation that “lose the skating championship” means finishing last at this championship, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Lose the skating championship” is interpreted as finishing last rather than simply “not winning.”
- The relevant event is the Ladies’ competition at the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships, which is the event represented by the available table.
