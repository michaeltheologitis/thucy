Summary
- I verified the claim against the TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema) using the table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs. This table records Superleague Formula entries by football club, including continent and seasons.

Checks and Evidence
1) Is FC Basel 1893 one of the two football clubs in Asia?
- Evidence A — List Asian clubs and their seasons
  SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "football club", seasons
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE continent = 'asia'
  ORDER BY "football club";
  Result:
  - football club: beijing guoan, seasons: 2008 2010
  - football club: team japan, seasons: 2011

- Evidence B — Count distinct Asian clubs
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "football club") AS asia_club_count
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE continent = 'asia';
  Result:
  - asia_club_count: 2

- Evidence C — FC Basel 1893 continent and seasons
  SQL:
  SELECT "football club", continent, seasons
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE "football club" ILIKE 'FC Basel 1893';
  Result:
  - football club: fc basel 1893, continent: europe, seasons: 2008 2009 2010

Conclusion for this part: Although the dataset shows there are exactly 2 Asian clubs (Beijing Guoan and Team Japan), FC Basel 1893 is listed under continent = Europe, not Asia. So the statement that FC Basel 1893 is one of the two Asian clubs is not supported and is contradicted by the data.

2) Did FC Basel 1893 participate in the 2008 and 2010 seasons?
- Evidence — Presence of 2008 and 2010 in FC Basel 1893’s seasons
  SQL:
  SELECT seasons,
         (seasons LIKE '%2008%') AS has_2008,
         (seasons LIKE '%2010%') AS has_2010
  FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs
  WHERE "football club" ILIKE 'FC Basel 1893';
  Result:
  - seasons: 2008 2009 2010
  - has_2008: true
  - has_2010: true

Conclusion for this part: FC Basel 1893 participated in both 2008 and 2010 (and also 2009) seasons in this dataset.

Overall Conclusion
- The claim mixes a false part (FC Basel 1893 being one of the two Asian clubs) with a true part (participation in the 2008 and 2010 seasons). Therefore, the overall claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (Superleague Formula football-club-associated teams) because this is the authoritative data source accessible. Seasons refer to Superleague Formula seasons, not UEFA or other competitions.
- Matching for club name used case-insensitive comparison (ILIKE) due to lowercased values in the dataset.
- The seasons column stores season years as text; substring checks were used to confirm inclusion of years 2008 and 2010.
