Summary
- Data source discovered: TabFact (PostgreSQL), public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season with columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "tv time" (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence
1) Retrieve attendance for weeks 3 and 4
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "tv time", attendance
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season
WHERE week IN (3,4)
ORDER BY week;

Result:
- week = 3, date = september 14 , 1997, opponent = atlanta falcons, result = w 36 - 31, tv time = nbc 10:00 am, attendance = 47922
- week = 4, date = september 21 , 1997, opponent = new york jets, result = l 23 - 22, tv time = nbc 10:00 am, attendance = 72586

2) Direct boolean comparison (week 4 > week 3?)
Executed SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN w4.attendance > w3.attendance THEN true ELSE false END AS week4_greater_than_week3
FROM (SELECT attendance FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week = 3) w3
CROSS JOIN (SELECT attendance FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week = 4) w4;

Result:
- week4_greater_than_week3 = true

3) Check row counts per week (to confirm uniqueness)
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season
WHERE week IN (3,4)
GROUP BY week
ORDER BY week;

Result:
- week 3: cnt = 1
- week 4: cnt = 1

Conclusion
- Attendance in week 4 (72,586) is higher than in week 3 (47,922). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the identified table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the dataset available (1997 Oakland Raiders season) and compares the attendance column across weeks.
- Each relevant week appears once in the table (validated by the row count query).
