Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Magg’s Magnificent Mild received a Bronze award two times at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.”

Summary conclusion: The data show no Bronze awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition for Maggs Magnificent Mild between 1995 and 2005. The beer did earn a Bronze medal in 2005 at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition (regional, not national). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

- Supporting context (Bronze awards in 1995–2005 regardless of competition):
SQL executed:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE prize ILIKE '%bronze%'
  AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005
ORDER BY year
LIMIT 100;
- Result:

Conclusion based on evidence:
- There are zero instances of Maggs Magnificent Mild receiving a Bronze award at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005. The beer did receive a Bronze at a regional SIBA competition in 2005 and non-Bronze awards at the SIBA National in 2003 (Gold) and 2006 (Silver). The claim that it received two Bronze awards at the SIBA National in the specified period is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The table public.west_berkshire_brewery comprehensively represents West Berkshire Brewery’s awards history for the period in question.
- Competition matching used case-insensitive substring on “SIBA National Beer Competition.” If alternative naming not containing that substring were used, it could be missed; however, returned rows explicitly include “siba national beer competition,” indicating consistent naming in this dataset.
- Beer name normalization: the dataset stores the beer as “maggs magnificent mild” (no apostrophe). Searches accounted for this by using flexible, case-insensitive matching.
