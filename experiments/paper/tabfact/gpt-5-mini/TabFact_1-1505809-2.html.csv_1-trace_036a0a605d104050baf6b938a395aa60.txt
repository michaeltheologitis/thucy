Summary
- Claim: "skip jean - michel ménard have a shot pct of 80% and 8 blank end"
- Conclusion: Supported by the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier dataset in the TabFact database.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data sources: TabFact (postgres_tabfact28) with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier, which contains columns for skip (player/role), shot pct, and blank ends.
  - Columns of interest: skip (text), shot pct (text), blank ends (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve the shot percentage and blank ends for the team skipped by Jean‑Michel Ménard from the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "skip", "shot pct", "blank ends" 
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "skip" ILIKE '%Jean%';

Result row:
- skip: "jean - michel mãnard"
- shot pct: "80%"
- blank ends: 8

Assessment
- The row for the skip recorded as "jean - michel mãnard" matches Jean‑Michel Ménard (minor differences in punctuation/diacritics). The values align with the claim: shot pct = 80% and blank ends = 8.
- Minor wording difference in the claim (“blank end” vs. “blank ends”) is not material.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier event (as per the available dataset t_2005_tim_hortons_brier).
- The name variant "jean - michel mãnard" in the table corresponds to Jean‑Michel Ménard.
- "blank end" in the claim refers to the "blank ends" statistic in the table.
