Claim interpreted: “The Nuggets lost all 6 games played at the Pepsi Center during this span.”

Data source explored
- Database: postgres_tabfact28 (TabFact)
- Relevant table: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season (Denver Nuggets game log subset for 2009–10)
  - Key columns used: date (text), team (opponent), score (starts with ‘w’ or ‘l’), location attendance (arena name + attendance), record (running record)

Evidence
1) How many games at Pepsi Center, and what were the results?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS total_pepsi_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%';
  Result: total_pepsi_games = 6

- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS pepsi_losses FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%' AND lower(score) LIKE 'l%';
  Result: pepsi_losses = 0

- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS pepsi_wins FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%' AND lower(score) LIKE 'w%';
  Result: pepsi_wins = 6

2) Which games were these?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, team, score, record, "location attendance" 
  FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season 
  WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Pepsi Center%' 
  ORDER BY ctid;
  Returned rows:
  - november 1 — vs grizzlies — Score: w 133 - 123 (ot) — Record: 3 - 0 — Location: pepsi center 15823
  - november 13 — vs lakers — Score: w 105 - 79 (ot) — Record: 7 - 3 — Location: pepsi center 19141
  - november 17 — vs raptors — Score: w 130 - 112 (ot) — Record: 8 - 3 — Location: pepsi center 16446
  - november 21 — vs bulls — Score: w 112 - 93 (ot) — Record: 9 - 4 — Location: pepsi center 19359
  - november 24 — vs nets — Score: w 101 - 87 (ot) — Record: 10 - 4 — Location: pepsi center 18743
  - november 27 — vs knicks — Score: w 128 - 125 (ot) — Record: 12 - 4 — Location: pepsi center 19155

3) Date span of the Pepsi Center games in this dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MIN(date) AS first_date, MAX(date) AS last_date
  FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
  WHERE LOWER("location attendance") LIKE '%pepsi center%';
  Result: first_date = "november 1", last_date = "november 27"

Conclusion
- The data shows 6 games at the Pepsi Center in this span, and the Nuggets won all 6 (0 losses). Therefore, the claim that they “lost all 6” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “This span” is interpreted as the period represented by the available table subset (November 2009 entries in the 2009–10 season dataset).
- Game outcomes are determined by the first character of the score field (‘w’ for win, ‘l’ for loss).
- Home games at Denver’s arena are identified by location attendance containing “Pepsi Center.”
