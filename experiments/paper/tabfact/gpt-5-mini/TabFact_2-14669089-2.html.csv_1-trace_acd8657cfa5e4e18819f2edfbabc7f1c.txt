Scope of verification
- Data source: PostgreSQL database tabfact18, schema public.
- Table used: public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa (columns: name, city, years as tallest, metres, feet, floors).
- Interpretation of the claim: "There is no building with less than 196 feet" refers to the feet column (strictly < 196) within this table.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Minimum height in feet
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(feet) AS min_feet FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa;
Result: min_feet = 196

2) Count of buildings with feet < 196
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_lt_196 FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE feet < 196;
Result: count_lt_196 = 0

3) List any buildings with feet < 196
SQL executed:
SELECT name, city, feet FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE feet < 196 ORDER BY feet ASC, name;
Result: no rows returned

4) Check for unknown heights (NULL feet)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_null_feet FROM public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE feet IS NULL;
Result: count_null_feet = 0

Conclusion
- The minimum feet value is 196.
- There are zero records with feet strictly less than 196, and no NULL heights.
- Therefore, within this dataset, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- The claim is evaluated against the available dataset (public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa) rather than all buildings globally.
- "Less than 196 feet" is interpreted strictly as < 196, not ≤ 196.
- The feet column represents total building height in feet for each listed building.
