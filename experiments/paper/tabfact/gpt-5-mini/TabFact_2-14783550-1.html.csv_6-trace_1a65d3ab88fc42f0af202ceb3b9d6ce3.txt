Claim to verify: "china have win 40 more gold medal than iran for wushu at the asian game"

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact8)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
- Columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Step 2 — Retrieve the relevant data
Query A — Get gold medal counts for China and Iran
Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, gold FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games WHERE nation ILIKE 'china%' OR nation ILIKE 'iran%';
Results:
- nation: "china (chn)", gold: 43
- nation: "iran (iri)", gold: 4

Query B — Compute the difference (China minus Iran)
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(gold) FILTER (WHERE nation ILIKE 'china%') AS china_gold,
  SUM(gold) FILTER (WHERE nation ILIKE 'iran%') AS iran_gold,
  SUM(gold) FILTER (WHERE nation ILIKE 'china%') - SUM(gold) FILTER (WHERE nation ILIKE 'iran%') AS china_minus_iran
FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games;
Results:
- china_gold: 43
- iran_gold: 4
- china_minus_iran: 39

Findings
- China has 43 Wushu gold medals at the Asian Games in this dataset.
- Iran has 4 Wushu gold medals.
- The difference is 39, not 40.

Conclusion
- The statement that China has won 40 more Wushu gold medals than Iran at the Asian Games is not supported by the data; the correct difference is 39.

Assumptions
- Nation labels in the table are matched by case-insensitive prefixes: "china (chn)" for China and "iran (iri)" for Iran.
- The table aggregates total Wushu medals for each nation across Asian Games and is treated as authoritative for this verification.
