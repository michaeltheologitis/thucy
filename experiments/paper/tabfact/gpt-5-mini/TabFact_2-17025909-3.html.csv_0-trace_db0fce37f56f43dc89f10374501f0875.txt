Claim to verify: "the nation of croatia win 3 medal all together , 2 of which be silver"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact20 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships (columns: rank text, nation text, gold bigint, silver bigint, bronze bigint, total bigint)

Evidence:
1) Retrieve Croatia’s medal counts
- Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE nation ILIKE '%croatia%';
- Result row:
{"nation":"croatia","gold":0,"silver":2,"bronze":1,"total":3}

2) Direct confirmation that total=3 and silver=2 for Croatia
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT count(*) FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE lower(nation)='croatia' AND total=3 AND silver=2;
- Result: count = 1

- Executed SQL (row retrieval):
SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE lower(nation)='croatia' AND total=3 AND silver=2;
- Result row:
{ rank: "8", nation: "croatia", gold: 0, silver: 2, bronze: 1, total: 3 }

Assessment:
- The data shows Croatia has a total of 3 medals, with 2 silver medals (and 1 bronze, 0 gold) in the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships. This precisely matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted with respect to the available dataset (2003 World Taekwondo Championships), as no other event context was provided or available in the connected data sources.
- Nation name matching is case-insensitive (table stores it as "croatia").
