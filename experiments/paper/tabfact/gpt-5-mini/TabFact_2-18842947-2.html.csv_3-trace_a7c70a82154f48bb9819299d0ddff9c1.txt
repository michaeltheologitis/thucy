Summary
- Claim interpreted: The Detroit Lions’ highest (most) points scored in a single game (within the available season data) is 41.
- Data source discovered: postgres_tabfact17 (TabFact), schema public, table t_1976_detroit_lions_season.

Data exploration and evidence
1) Inspect result field format
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week;
Key returned rows (as observed by the tool):
- week 1: l 10 - 3
- week 2: w 24 - 10
- week 3: l 10 - 9
- week 4: l 24 - 14
- week 5: w 30 - 10
- week 6: l 20 - 7
- week 7: w 41 - 14
- week 8: w 27 - 6
- week 9: l 31 - 23
- week 10: l 17 - 16
- week 11: w 14 - 10
- week 12: w 27 - 14
- week 13: l 24 - 10
- week 14: l 20 - 17
Interpretation: The string begins with W/L followed by the Lions’ score and the opponent score (e.g., "w 41 - 14").

2) Compute the maximum Lions points in a single game
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(substring(result FROM '^[A-Za-z]\s*([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER)) AS max_points FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result returned:
- max_points: 41

Conclusion
- The data shows the Detroit Lions’ highest single-game point total in the 1976 season is 41 points. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- "lion" refers to the Detroit Lions NFL team.
- Scope is the 1976 season, which is the only Lions-related dataset available in the connected data source.
- "most point score" means the maximum points scored by the Lions in any one game that season.
- The result field’s first integer after W/L represents the Lions’ points in that game, consistent across rows.
