Claim: “the person who have an all - time rank of 53 , have 258 apps”

Data sources discovered:
- postgres_tabfact12 (schema: public) with table public.football_records_in_italy
  Columns: rank (bigint), all - time rank (text), name (text), debut year (bigint), current club (text), goals (bigint), apps (bigint)

Evidence:
1) Identify the record with all - time rank = '53' and retrieve apps
SQL:
SELECT "all - time rank", name, apps FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE "all - time rank" = '53';
Result:
- all - time rank: 53
- name: luca toni
- apps: 258

2) Cross-check note on numeric rank column
- This table’s numeric column rank only spans 1–10; there is no numeric rank = 53. This confirms we must interpret “all - time rank” as the text column.
SQL:
SELECT MIN("rank") AS min_rank, MAX("rank") AS max_rank, COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.football_records_in_italy;
Result: min_rank = 1, max_rank = 10, total_rows = 10

SQL:
SELECT name, apps FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE "rank" = 53;
Result: no rows

Conclusion:
- The record with all - time rank = 53 has apps = 258. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “all - time rank” refers to the text column named exactly "all - time rank" in public.football_records_in_italy.
- “apps” refers to the column apps (appearances) in the same table.
