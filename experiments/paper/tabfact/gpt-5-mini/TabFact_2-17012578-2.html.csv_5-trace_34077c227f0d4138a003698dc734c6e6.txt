Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Brendan Melnyk is the lead and Ted Appelman is the skip (implicitly on a curling team). I verified this against the available authoritative dataset.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public).
- Relevant table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials with columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Exact (case-sensitive) match for lead = 'Brendan Melnyk' AND skip = 'Ted Appelman'
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE lead = 'Brendan Melnyk' AND skip = 'Ted Appelman';
Result: No rows (empty result).

2) Case-insensitive search for any occurrence of 'Appelman' or 'Melnyk' in any column
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE skip ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR second ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR lead ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR city ILIKE '%Appelman%' OR skip ILIKE '%Melnyk%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Melnyk%' OR second ILIKE '%Melnyk%' OR lead ILIKE '%Melnyk%' OR city ILIKE '%Melnyk%';
Result (1 row): { city: "edmonton", lead: "brendan melnyk", second: "bradon klassen", skip: "ted appelman", third / vice skip: "tom appelman" }

3) Case-insensitive match for the pair (lead = Brendan Melnyk AND skip = Ted Appelman)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE lead ILIKE 'Brendan Melnyk' AND skip ILIKE 'Ted Appelman';
Result (1 row): { city: "edmonton", lead: "brendan melnyk", second: "bradon klassen", skip: "ted appelman", third / vice skip: "tom appelman" }

Findings:
- The dataset contains a team entry where the lead is brendan melnyk and the skip is ted appelman (stored in lowercase). This directly supports the claim.
- Additional context from the same row: city is edmonton; third/vice is tom appelman; second is bradon klassen.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to team roles as recorded in the available table t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials. Names in the table are stored in lowercase; therefore, case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) was used to validate the claim.
