Claim interpreted: “Collingwood’s home opponent is St Kilda.”

Data source consulted: TabFact PostgreSQL database, table public.t_1969_vfl_season (columns: date, home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd).

Evidence from executed SQL

1) Identify Collingwood home games and their opponents
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "venue", "home team score", "away team score"
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") = 'collingwood'
ORDER BY "date";
Result:
- date: 23 august 1969 | home team: collingwood | away team: south melbourne | venue: victoria park | home team score: 19.15 (129) | away team score: 6.22 (58)

2) Distinct away opponents when Collingwood is the home team
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "away team"
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") = 'collingwood'
ORDER BY "away team";
Result:
- south melbourne

3) Check if any match in the table involves St Kilda (to see whether Collingwood vs St Kilda appears at all)
SQL:
SELECT "date", "home team", "away team", "venue"
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") = 'st kilda' OR lower("away team") = 'st kilda'
ORDER BY "date";
Result:
- date: 23 august 1969 | home team: st kilda | away team: north melbourne | venue: moorabbin oval

Findings
- The only Collingwood home game present in this dataset has South Melbourne as the away opponent, not St Kilda.
- The only St Kilda match present in this dataset is St Kilda vs North Melbourne, with St Kilda as the home team.
- No row shows Collingwood (home) vs St Kilda (away).

Conclusion
Based on the available data, Collingwood’s home opponent is not St Kilda; it is South Melbourne in the recorded match.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated strictly against the accessible dataset (public.t_1969_vfl_season), which appears to cover at least matches dated 23 August 1969. Team-name matching was done case-insensitively using exact names as stored (e.g., "collingwood", "st kilda").
