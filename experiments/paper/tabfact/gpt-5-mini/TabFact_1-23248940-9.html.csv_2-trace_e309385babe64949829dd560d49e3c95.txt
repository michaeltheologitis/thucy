Claim to verify: “the most rebound by a Bobcat player in 1 game be 20.”

Data sources discovered and used:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), schema: public
- Table: t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season — game-by-game log for the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season, including leading individual stats for each game (high points, high rebounds, high assists).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Find the maximum single-game rebounds (“high rebounds”) recorded in the available season log
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(NULLIF(regexp_replace("high rebounds", '[^0-9]+', '', 'g'), '')::int) AS max_high_rebounds FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
- Result: 20

2) Retrieve the game(s) where this maximum occurred
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists", "location attendance", record
  FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  WHERE NULLIF(regexp_replace("high rebounds", '[^0-9]+', '', 'g'), '')::int = 20
  ORDER BY date;
- Result (one row):
  {"game": 51,
   "date": "february 10",
   "team": "minnesota",
   "score": "w 93 - 92 (ot)",
   "high points": "stephen jackson (33)",
   "high rebounds": "nazr mohammed (20)",
   "high assists": "dj augustin (7)",
   "location attendance": "target center 13352",
   "record": "26 - 25"}

Conclusion:
- Within the scope of the available data (the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season), the highest single-game rebound total by a Bobcats player is 20 (Nazr Mohammed on February 10 at Minnesota, OT). This supports the claim for that season.
- However, we do not have data for other seasons, so we cannot confirm that 20 is the all-time Bobcats franchise single-game record across all years.

Assumptions made:
- “Bobcat player” refers to a Charlotte Bobcats player (NBA franchise active as Bobcats during 2004–2014).
- “Most rebound … in 1 game” is interpreted as the maximum single-game rebounds by any Bobcats player in the dataset at hand.
- The “high rebounds” field combines player name and count; the numeric value was extracted for computation, as shown in the SQL.
