Claim interpreted: There exists a case where three teams are tied on points but are separated by goal difference.

Data source explored: TabFact (postgres_tabfact25) — table public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football with columns: position, team, points, played, against, difference.

Findings
- The table contains exactly one instance of a three-team tie on points: at 6 points, among botafogo, vasco da gama, and américa. Their goal differences are distinct (0, -2, -10), which separates them when ordered by goal difference.

Evidence with executed SQL and results
1) Identify points totals where three or more teams are tied
SQL:
SELECT points, count(*) AS team_count, array_agg(team ORDER BY position) AS teams
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY points
HAVING count(*) >= 3
ORDER BY points DESC;
Result:
- points = 6, team_count = 3, teams = ["botafogo", "vasco da gama", "américa"].

2) List all tied point totals and show teams’ goal differences (text and numeric for ordering)
SQL (step A — find tied point totals):
SELECT points, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY points
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY points DESC;
Result rows:
- points: 13, cnt: 2
- points: 6, cnt: 3

SQL (step B — show teams on tied points with numeric goal difference for ordering):
SELECT team, points, difference AS goal_difference,
       regexp_replace(replace(difference, '−', '-'), '[^0-9\-]', '', 'g')::integer AS goal_diff_num
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
WHERE points IN (
  SELECT points
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  GROUP BY points
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
)
ORDER BY points DESC, goal_diff_num DESC, team;
Result rows (ordered by points desc, goal_diff_num desc):
- fluminense — points: 13, goal_difference: 10, goal_diff_num: 10
- flamengo — points: 13, goal_difference: 8, goal_diff_num: 8
- botafogo — points: 6, goal_difference: 0, goal_diff_num: 0
- vasco da gama — points: 6, goal_difference: - 2, goal_diff_num: -2
- américa — points: 6, goal_difference: - 10, goal_diff_num: -10

Conclusion: The data shows a three-team tie on points (6) that is indeed separated by goal difference (0, -2, -10), satisfying the claim.

Assumptions
- Because the request was ambiguous and no specific league/season was provided, I verified the claim against the only available sports standings table in the accessible database: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football (interpreted as a standings table for Brazilian football in 1940). If you intended a different competition/season, provide details and I can re-verify accordingly.
