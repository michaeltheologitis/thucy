Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible relational source: TabFact PostgreSQL database with a public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect the table contents
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf;
Key rows observed (subset, formatted):
- place: 1 | player: steve stricker | country: united states | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | to par: - 1
- Additional rows show higher totals (e.g., 140, 141, 142, 143, etc.).

2) Compute the lowest total score by parsing the numeric total after '='
SQL executed:
SELECT MIN((regexp_replace(score, '.*=\s*', ''))::int) AS min_total FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf;
Result: min_total = 139

3) Retrieve the player(s) with that lowest total
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country, score, (regexp_replace(score, '.*=\s*', ''))::int AS parsed_total
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE (regexp_replace(score, '.*=\s*', ''))::int = 139
ORDER BY player;
Result:
- player: steve stricker | country: united states | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | parsed_total: 139

4) Check for ties at the lowest total
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, (COUNT(*) > 1) AS is_tie
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE (regexp_replace(score, '.*=\s*', ''))::int = 139;
Result: cnt = 1, is_tie = false

Conclusion
- The data show that steve stricker (country: united states) has the lowest score (139) among all players listed in the table, with no tie. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “lowest score” as the lowest numeric total parsed from the score column of this dataset (e.g., the 139 in “70 + 69 = 139”).
- The verification is scoped to the available dataset (t_2006_u_s_open_golf) and treats it as authoritative for this event snapshot.
