Claim to verify: "there be 31002 crowd attendance when uab be the opponent"

Evidence gathered from the available data source (TabFact PostgreSQL, public schema):
- We queried the only relevant sports table: public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99, which contains opponent and attendance fields.
- The query returned a single game where the opponent is UAB, with an attendance value of 31002.

Returned row:
- date: october 10
- opponent: uab
- site: dowdy - ficklen stadium greenville , nc
- result: w26 - 7
- attendance: 31002

Executed SQL (as run):
SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%UAB%'
ORDER BY date;

Conclusion:
- The data shows a matchup against UAB with an attendance of 31002, which matches the claim exactly.

Assumptions:
- The available dataset covers East Carolina Pirates football (1990–1999). I interpreted the claim within the scope of this dataset, treating “when UAB be the opponent” as referring to East Carolina’s game(s) against UAB in this table.
