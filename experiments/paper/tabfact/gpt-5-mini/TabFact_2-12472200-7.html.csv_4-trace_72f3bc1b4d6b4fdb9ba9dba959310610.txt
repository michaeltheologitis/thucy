Summary of steps
- Discovered available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.olga_govortsova.
- Queried the table to retrieve Olga Govortsova’s Grand Slam results by year, focusing on the French Open.
- Verified whether she reached the third round in consecutive years.

Key evidence from the data
- The French Open results for Olga Govortsova (2007–2011) are: 2007 = a, 2008 = 3r, 2009 = 3r, 2010 = 2r, 2011 = 2r.
- This shows she reached the third round in consecutive years 2008 and 2009.

Executed SQL (exact queries)
1) Full table to inspect all tournament results:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;

Relevant row returned for the French Open:
- tournament: french open; 2007: a; 2008: 3r; 2009: 3r; 2010: 2r; 2011: 2r

2) Explicit extraction of years with third-round (3r) results at the French Open:
SELECT year, result FROM (
  SELECT '2007' as year, "2007" as result, tournament FROM public.olga_govortsova
  UNION ALL SELECT '2008', "2008", tournament FROM public.olga_govortsova
  UNION ALL SELECT '2009', "2009", tournament FROM public.olga_govortsova
  UNION ALL SELECT '2010', "2010", tournament FROM public.olga_govortsova
  UNION ALL SELECT '2011', "2011", tournament FROM public.olga_govortsova
) t WHERE tournament ILIKE 'french open' AND result='3r';

Result:
- 2008, 3r
- 2009, 3r

Conclusion
- The data confirms Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round of the French Open in two consecutive years, 2008 and 2009. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted '3r' as "third round" and 'a' as absent/not applicable.
- The available dataset spans 2007–2011; the claim was evaluated within this scope.
- "Advance to the third round" is treated as equivalent to "reach the third round."
