Claim interpreted: “The most points scored by the Miami Dolphins in a single game is 38.” I verified this against the available data in the TabFact database, which contains a table for the 1983 Miami Dolphins season.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Step 1 — Inspect the table and the result format
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week ASC LIMIT 15;

Key observed rows (showing the result format “w 34 - 24”, “l 27 - 14”, etc.):
1) week: 1, date: "september 4 , 1983", opponent: "buffalo bills", result: "w 12 - 0", attendance: 78715
2) week: 2, date: "september 11 , 1983", opponent: "new england patriots", result: "w 34 - 24", attendance: 59343
3) week: 3, date: "september 19 , 1983", opponent: "los angeles raiders", result: "l 27 - 14", attendance: 57796
...
15) week: 15, date: "december 10 , 1983", opponent: "atlanta falcons", result: "w 31 - 24", attendance: 56725

Observation: The result field uses a leading “w”/“l” followed by two numbers separated by “ - ”. For wins, the Dolphins’ score is the left number; for losses, it is the right number.

Step 2 — Compute Dolphins points per game and order by points
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
CASE
 WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(result,'-',1), '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer)
 WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN CAST(regexp_replace(split_part(result,'-',2), '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS integer)
 ELSE NULL END AS dolphins_points
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
ORDER BY dolphins_points DESC;

Result excerpt (top values):
- week 13 | november 28 , 1983 | cincinnati bengals | w 38 - 14 | dolphins_points = 38
- week 12 | november 20 , 1983 | baltimore colts    | w 37 - 0  | dolphins_points = 37
- week 6  | october 9 , 1983    | buffalo bills      | l 38 - 35 | dolphins_points = 35
- week 2  | september 11 , 1983 | new england patriots | w 34 - 24 | dolphins_points = 34
- week 16 | december 16 , 1983  | new york jets      | w 34 - 14 | dolphins_points = 34
(… remaining games follow at lower point totals)

Step 3 — Compute the maximum Dolphins points in a single game and identify the game(s)
Executed SQL (max value):
SELECT MAX(
  CASE
    WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 1))::int
    ELSE (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 2))::int
  END
) AS max_dolphins_points
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;

Returned value:
- max_dolphins_points = 38

Executed SQL (locate games at this maximum):
SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
  CASE
    WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 1))::int
    ELSE (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 2))::int
  END AS dolphins_points
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE (CASE
    WHEN lower(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 1))::int
    ELSE (split_part(regexp_replace(result,'[^0-9\-]','','g'), '-', 2))::int
  END) = 38
ORDER BY week;

Returned row:
- week: 13, date: november 28 , 1983, opponent: cincinnati bengals, result: w 38 - 14, dolphins_points: 38

Conclusion
- Based on the available data for the 1983 Miami Dolphins season, the maximum points scored by the Dolphins in a single game that season is 38 (Week 13 vs. Cincinnati Bengals, 38–14).

Verdict and scope
- Within the scope of the available data (1983 season), the claim is supported.

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (1983 Miami Dolphins season), as no broader franchise-wide data was accessible.
- Parsing logic: for entries beginning with ‘w’, Dolphins points are the left score; for entries beginning with ‘l’, Dolphins points are the right score. This is consistent with standard team-season table conventions and aligned with the data format observed.
