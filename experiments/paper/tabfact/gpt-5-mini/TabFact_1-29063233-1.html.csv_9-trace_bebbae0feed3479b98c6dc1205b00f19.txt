Claim: “beauty and the beast (part 2) have less uk viewer than beauty and the beast (part 1)”.

Evidence from data (Merlin Series 2 episode table with UK viewers):

Executed SQL 1:
SELECT "title", "uk viewers (million)" FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Beauty and the Beast%' ORDER BY "no for series";

Result:
- title: beauty and the beast (part 1) — uk viewers (million): 5.53
- title: beauty and the beast (part 2) — uk viewers (million): 6.14

Executed SQL 2 (comparison and difference):
SELECT
MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 1%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) AS part1_viewers,
MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 2%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) AS part2_viewers,
(MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 2%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) - MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 1%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END)) AS difference_million,
CASE WHEN MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 1%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) > 0 THEN ((MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 2%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) - MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 1%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END)) / MAX(CASE WHEN "title" ILIKE '%part 1%' THEN "uk viewers (million)" END) * 100) END AS percent_change
FROM public.merlin_series_2
WHERE "title" ILIKE '%Beauty and the Beast%';

Result:
- part1_viewers: 5.53
- part2_viewers: 6.14
- difference_million: 0.61
- percent_change: ~11.03%

Conclusion: Part 2 had more UK viewers (6.14 million) than Part 1 (5.53 million). Therefore, the claim that Part 2 had fewer UK viewers is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “beauty and the beast (part 1/part 2)” refers to the two-part episodes in Merlin Series 2, which include UK viewership figures in the available dataset.
