Claim interpreted: “the most points scored by the Lions in a single game is 58.” Given the available data (TabFact database), the only relevant dataset we can access is the Detroit Lions’ 1976 season. I therefore verify the claim within that scope.

Data sources discovered
- TabFact (public schema). No other sports databases are accessible.

Relevant schema identified
- public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Preview the 1976 Lions season table
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week LIMIT 10;
Result (sample): shows results like “w 41 - 14” and “l 31 - 23,” confirming format and content.

2) Parse Lions’ points each game and list all rows
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
CASE WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='w' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',2) as int)
     WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='l' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',4) as int)
     ELSE NULL END AS lions_points
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
ORDER BY week;
Returned rows (week/date/opponent/result/lions_points):
- 1 / september 12 , 1976 / chicago bears / l 10 - 3 / 3
- 2 / september 19 , 1976 / atlanta falcons / w 24 - 10 / 24
- 3 / september 26 , 1976 / minnesota vikings / l 10 - 9 / 9
- 4 / october 3 , 1976 / green bay packers / l 24 - 14 / 14
- 5 / october 10 , 1976 / new england patriots / w 30 - 10 / 30
- 6 / october 17 , 1976 / washington redskins / l 20 - 7 / 7
- 7 / october 24 , 1976 / seattle seahawks / w 41 - 14 / 41
- 8 / october 31 , 1976 / green bay packers / w 27 - 6 / 27
- 9 / november 7 , 1976 / minnesota vikings / l 31 - 23 / 23
- 10 / november 14 , 1976 / new orleans saints / l 17 - 16 / 16
- 11 / november 21 , 1976 / chicago bears / w 14 - 10 / 14
- 12 / november 25 , 1976 / buffalo bills / w 27 - 14 / 27
- 13 / december 5 , 1976 / new york giants / l 24 - 10 / 10
- 14 / december 11 , 1976 / los angeles rams / l 20 - 17 / 17

3) Compute the maximum Lions points scored in the 1976 season
SQL:
SELECT MAX(
CASE WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='w' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',2) as int)
     WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='l' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',4) as int)
     ELSE NULL END
) AS max_lions_points
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result: max_lions_points = 41

4) Identify the game(s) with that maximum
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
CASE WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='w' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',2) as int)
     WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='l' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',4) as int)
     ELSE NULL END AS lions_points
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE
CASE WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='w' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',2) as int)
     WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='l' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',4) as int)
     ELSE NULL END = (
  SELECT MAX(
  CASE WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='w' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',2) as int)
       WHEN lower(split_part(result,' ',1))='l' THEN cast(split_part(result,' ',4) as int)
       ELSE NULL END
  ) FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
);
Result: Week 7 (October 24, 1976) vs Seattle Seahawks, result “w 41 - 14” (Lions scored 41).

5) Direct check for any 58-point game in 1976
SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result,
    CASE
      WHEN result ILIKE 'w %' THEN (regexp_replace(result, '^w\s*([0-9]+)\s*-\s*[0-9]+.*$', '\1'))::int
      WHEN result ILIKE 'l %' THEN (regexp_replace(result, '^l\s*[0-9]+\s*-\s*([0-9]+).*$','\1'))::int
      ELSE NULL
    END AS lions_points
  FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
)
SELECT * FROM parsed WHERE lions_points = 58;
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- Within the only accessible dataset (1976 Detroit Lions season), the most points the Lions scored in a single game was 41, not 58. There is no instance of the Lions scoring 58 points in that season.

Assumptions
- “the lion” is interpreted as the Detroit Lions (NFL).
- Scope is constrained to the available dataset (1976 season) in the TabFact database; no all-time franchise data is accessible here.
- The result format is parsed as: for rows starting with ‘w’, the first numeric value is the Lions’ points; for rows starting with ‘l’, the second numeric value is the Lions’ points.
