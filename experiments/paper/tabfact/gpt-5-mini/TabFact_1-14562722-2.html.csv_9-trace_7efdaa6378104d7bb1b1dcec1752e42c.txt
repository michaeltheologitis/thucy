Conclusion: Interpreting the claim as asserting that any entry has more than 1 disc (i.e., discs > 1 for at least one row), the data contradicts it. All rows show discs = 1, and there are zero rows with discs > 1.

What I checked and why
- Because the claim mentions “disc,” I examined the only available data source and located a column named discs in the public.my_info_table. I verified whether any row has discs > 1 and summarized the distribution of the discs values.

Data source discovery
- Tool result: One accessible PostgreSQL data source (TabFact database), schema public, table: my_info_table.

Schema details used
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Summary counts and bounds on discs
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows,
       COUNT(discs) AS discs_not_null,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE discs > 1) AS discs_gt_1,
       MIN(discs) AS min_discs,
       MAX(discs) AS max_discs
FROM public.my_info_table;
Result:
- total_rows = 5
- discs_not_null = 5
- discs_gt_1 = 0
- min_discs = 1
- max_discs = 1

2) Retrieve rows (if any) with discs > 1
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 1" AS region_1, "region 2" AS region_2, "region 4" AS region_4
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE discs > 1
LIMIT 20;
Result:
- 0 rows returned (no entries with discs > 1)

Additional context (alternative interpretation check)
3) Total discs across all rows (if one interprets the claim as a total sum across the dataset)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(discs) AS total_discs_across_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
Result:
- total_discs_across_rows = 5

4) Distribution of discs values
SQL executed:
SELECT discs, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.my_info_table GROUP BY discs ORDER BY discs NULLS LAST;
Result:
- discs = 1, count = 5

Overall assessment
- Under the per-entry interpretation (i.e., existence of any row with discs > 1), the data shows none. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data in this environment.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “there be more than 1 disc” as asserting that at least one row in the dataset has discs > 1. If instead the intent was to assert that the total number of discs across all rows exceeds 1, then that alternative claim would be true (sum(discs) = 5), but that is a different statement than typical per-item disc counts.
