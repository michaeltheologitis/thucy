Claim to verify: “Alfredo Binda won 7 races (stages) of the 1933 Giro d’Italia, and he was the race leader for 15 races (stages).”

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia with columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text).

Schema inspection (tool response)
- Tables in public schema: t_1933_giro_d_italia
- Columns: date, course, distance, winner, race leader

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Total rows and presence of non-stage rows
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia;
  Result: 24
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS rest_day_rows FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE winner ILIKE '%rest day%';
  Result: rest_day_rows = 6
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS summary_rows FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE date ILIKE '%total%';
  Result: summary_rows = 1
- SQL: SELECT (COUNT(*) - SUM(CASE WHEN winner ILIKE '%rest day%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) - SUM(CASE WHEN date ILIKE '%total%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS stage_rows_calculated FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia;
  Result: stage_rows_calculated = 17
Interpretation: The dataset includes 6 rest-day rows and 1 summary row, leaving 17 stage rows.

2) Stage wins by rider (stages only)
- SQL: SELECT winner, COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE NOT (winner ILIKE '%rest day%') AND NOT (date ILIKE '%total%') GROUP BY winner ORDER BY wins DESC, winner;
  Result (winner — wins):
  - alfredo binda ( ita ) — 6
  - learco guerra ( ita ) — 3
  - ettore meini ( ita ) — 2
  - gerard loncke ( bel ) — 2
  - giuseppe olmo ( ita ) — 2
  - fernand cornez ( fra ) — 1
  - mario cipriani ( ita ) — 1
Conclusion: Alfredo Binda won 6 stages (not 7).

3) Number of stages where Alfredo Binda was the race leader (stages only)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS binda_leader_stage_rows FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE NOT (winner ILIKE '%rest day%') AND NOT (date ILIKE '%total%') AND "race leader" ILIKE '%binda%';
  Result: binda_leader_stage_rows = 13
Conclusion: Alfredo Binda was race leader for 13 stages (not 15).

4) Cross-check: Text variants for Binda (case-insensitive)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT winner FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE winner ILIKE '%binda%';
  Result: alfredo binda ( ita )
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "race leader" FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE "race leader" ILIKE '%binda%';
  Result: alfredo binda ( ita )

Findings
- The data shows 17 stages in the 1933 Giro d’Italia (after excluding rest days and a summary row).
- Alfredo Binda won 6 stages, not 7.
- Alfredo Binda was the race leader on 13 stages, not 15.

Final assessment
- The claim overstates both Binda’s stage wins and the number of stages he led in the 1933 Giro.

Assumptions made
- “Race” in the user’s statement refers to “stages.”
- Case-insensitive matching identifies “Alfredo Binda” as recorded in the table as “alfredo binda ( ita ).”
- Stage counts exclude rows labeled as “rest day” and the “total” summary row, aligning with the notion of competitive stages only.
