Claim to verify: “fukusyū no puropōzu have 3.2% higher rating than the title with the most recent broadcast date.”

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: PostgreSQL schema public containing a single table tsuki_no_koibito. No other data sources were discovered.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.tsuki_no_koibito
  - Columns (all text): "Unnamed: 0", "episode title", "romanized title", "translation of title", "broadcast date", "ratings".

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect formats (to confirm values and guide parsing)
SQL executed:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", "ratings" FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito LIMIT 100;
Key returned rows (excerpt):
- {romanized title: "fukusyū no puropōzu", broadcast date: "may 24 , 2010", ratings: "15.6%"}
- {romanized title: "saishūshōjomakuwakare", broadcast date: "june 14 , 2010", ratings: "13.4%"}

2) Identify the title with the most recent broadcast date (parsing date and rating)
SQL executed:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", "ratings",
       to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ', 'g')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS broadcast_dt,
       (regexp_replace("ratings", '%', '', 'g'))::numeric AS rating_num
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY broadcast_dt DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- romanized title: saishūshōjomakuwakare; broadcast_dt: 2010-06-14; rating_num: 13.4

3) Fetch the “fukusyū no puropōzu” row with parsed values
SQL executed:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", "ratings",
       to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ', 'g')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS broadcast_dt,
       (regexp_replace("ratings", '%', '', 'g'))::numeric AS rating_num
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE "romanized title" = 'fukusyū no puropōzu';
Result:
- romanized title: fukusyū no puropōzu; broadcast_dt: 2010-05-24; rating_num: 15.6

4) Compute differences between the two ratings
SQL executed:
WITH recent AS (
  SELECT (regexp_replace("ratings", '%', '', 'g'))::numeric AS rating_num
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
  ORDER BY to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ', 'g')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') DESC
  LIMIT 1
), fuku AS (
  SELECT (regexp_replace("ratings", '%', '', 'g'))::numeric AS rating_num
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
  WHERE "romanized title" = 'fukusyū no puropōzu'
)
SELECT fuku.rating_num AS fukusy_rating, recent.rating_num AS recent_rating,
       (fuku.rating_num - recent.rating_num) AS diff_percentage_points,
       ((fuku.rating_num - recent.rating_num)/recent.rating_num*100) AS rel_percent_diff
FROM fuku, recent;
Result:
- fukusy_rating: 15.6; recent_rating: 13.4; diff_percentage_points: 2.2; rel_percent_diff: 16.417910447761194%

Assessment
- The title with the most recent broadcast date is “saishūshōjomakuwakare” (2010-06-14) with a rating of 13.4.
- “fukusyū no puropōzu” has a rating of 15.6.
- Difference: 15.6 − 13.4 = 2.2 percentage points (absolute). In relative terms, that is about 16.42% higher, not 3.2%.

Conclusion: The claim is incorrect. While “fukusyū no puropōzu” does have a higher rating than the most recent-broadcast title, the difference is 2.2 percentage points (≈16.42% relatively), not 3.2%.

Assumptions
- “Rating” refers to the numeric value in the "ratings" column after removing the percent sign.
- “Most recent broadcast date” is determined by parsing the "broadcast date" text into a date and taking the maximum.
- “3.2% higher” was interpreted as an absolute percentage-point difference; even under a relative-percent interpretation, the computed value (≈16.42%) does not match 3.2%.
