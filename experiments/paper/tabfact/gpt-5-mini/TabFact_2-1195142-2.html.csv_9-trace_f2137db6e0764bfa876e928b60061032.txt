Data sources discovered:
- TabFact PostgreSQL (public schema). Relevant table: la_cage_aux_folles_musical(year bigint, award text, category text, nominee text, result text).

Step 1: Check whether Gary Beach is listed as a Tony Award winner in the available data
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result
FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical
WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Gary Beach%';

Result:
- year: 2005 | award: tony award | category: best performance by a leading actor in a musical | nominee: gary beach | result: nominated

Observation: The only record for Gary Beach in this dataset shows a 2005 Tony Award nomination (not a win) for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical (La Cage aux Folles).

Step 2: Context — Tony Award outcomes for La Cage aux Folles in 2005
Executed SQL (list entries):
SELECT category, nominee, result FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND lower(award) = 'tony award' ORDER BY category, nominee;

Rows:
- best choreography | jerry mitchell | won
- best costume design | william ivey long | nominated
- best performance by a leading actor in a musical | gary beach | nominated
- best revival of a musical | best revival of a musical | won

Executed SQL (count outcomes):
SELECT lower(result) AS result_norm, count(*) AS cnt FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND lower(award) = 'tony award' GROUP BY result_norm ORDER BY result_norm;

Counts:
- nominated: 2
- won: 2

Assessment of the claim:
- The available data shows Gary Beach as a Tony Award nominee (not a winner) in 2005. While there were four La Cage-related Tony results that year (two wins, two nominations), Gary Beach was not among the winners in this dataset. Therefore, the claim that “gary beach be 1 of 4 winner of a tony award” is not supported by the accessible data; it is contradicted by the specific 2005 record we have.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as asserting that Gary Beach is (a) a Tony Award winner and/or (b) specifically one of four Tony Award winners in a relevant context. The only available award data in our environment pertains to La Cage aux Folles; no data for The Producers or other productions is present. Conclusions are limited to what this dataset supports.
