Claim: “the record after the September 28 win against the Red Sox be 76 - 86.”

What I checked
- Identified the available dataset as the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season table (t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season), which includes date, opponent, score, and the team record after each game.
- Queried for the game on September 28 against the Red Sox and inspected the resulting row for the post-game record.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%September 28%'
  AND opponent ILIKE '%Red Sox%';

Result:
- date: september 28
- opponent: red sox
- score: 3 - 2
- loss: gordon (6 - 10)
- attendance: 40251
- record: 76 - 86

Assessment
- Opponent: Red Sox — matches the claim.
- Outcome: The presence of a losing pitcher listed as “gordon (6 - 10)” and the score 3–2 indicates a Blue Jays win — matches the claim’s “win.”
- Post-game record: 76 - 86 — exactly matches the claim.

Conclusion
- The statement is fully supported by the dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays (the only available MLB season dataset here).
