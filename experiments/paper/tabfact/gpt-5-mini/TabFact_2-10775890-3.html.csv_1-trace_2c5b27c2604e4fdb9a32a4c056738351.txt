Summary
- I explored the available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table public.t_1960_vfl_season containing VFL match results for the 1960 season, including home/away teams and scores in the format goals.behinds (total points).

Evidence and Queries
1) Existence of a match with home score 5.12 (42) and away score 3.8 (26)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team","home team score","away team","away team score","date","venue"
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '5.12 (42)'
  AND "away team score" = '3.8 (26)';
- Result: One match found
  {"home team":"north melbourne","home team score":"5.12 (42)","away team":"richmond","away team score":"3.8 (26)","date":"7 may 1960","venue":"arden street oval"}
- Interpretation: In this match, the home team scored 5.12 (42) and the away team scored 3.8 (26), confirming the claim.

2) Validation that the score strings’ totals are correct
- Executed SQL:
SELECT
  "home team",
  "home team score" AS home_score_str,
  split_part("home team score",'.',1)::int AS home_goals,
  split_part(split_part("home team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int AS home_behinds,
  regexp_replace(split_part("home team score",' ',2),'[()]','','g')::int AS home_points,
  (split_part("home team score",'.',1)::int)*6 + (split_part(split_part("home team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) AS home_calc,
  ((split_part("home team score",'.',1)::int)*6 + (split_part(split_part("home team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) = (regexp_replace(split_part("home team score",' ',2),'[()]','','g')::int)) AS home_matches,
  "away team",
  "away team score" AS away_score_str,
  split_part("away team score",'.',1)::int AS away_goals,
  split_part(split_part("away team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int AS away_behinds,
  regexp_replace(split_part("away team score",' ',2),'[()]','', 'g')::int AS away_points,
  (split_part("away team score",'.',1)::int)*6 + (split_part(split_part("away team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) AS away_calc,
  ((split_part("away team score",'.',1)::int)*6 + (split_part(split_part("away team score",'.',2),' ',1)::int) = (regexp_replace(split_part("away team score",' ',2),'[()]','','g')::int)) AS away_matches
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '5.12 (42)'
  AND "away team score" = '3.8 (26)';
- Returned values (key fields):
  - Home: goals=5, behinds=12, points=42, computed 5*6+12=42, match=true
  - Away: goals=3, behinds=8, points=26, computed 3*6+8=26, match=true
- Interpretation: The totals in both score strings are internally consistent with Australian rules football scoring (goal=6 points, behind=1 point).

Conclusion
- The statement that 3.8 (26) is the away team score against a home team that scored 5.12 (42) is supported by the 1960 VFL season data (North Melbourne vs Richmond on 7 May 1960 at Arden Street Oval).

Assumptions
- I assumed the user’s claim pertains to the available dataset (1960 VFL season) and to the standard AFL/VFL scoring notation goals.behinds (total).
- I treated the TabFact database as authoritative for the 1960 season records, per the provided grounding principles.
