Summary
- Claim interpreted: Whether there are more than two teams that have the same score in the 1st leg of the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs ties contained in the available data.
- Conclusion: Verified. At least 8 teams scored exactly 1 goal in the 1st leg, which is more than two teams sharing the same score.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact5), schema: public.

Schema exploration
- Relevant table identified: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs with columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text).

Evidence 1: Raw 1st leg results
Executed SQL query:
SELECT "team 1", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "team 2" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;

Results ("team 1" | "1st leg" | "2nd leg" | "team 2"):
1) botswana defence force xi | 1 - 1 | 0 - 1 | mbabane highlanders
2) arsenal (maseru)         | 3 - 0 | 1 - 0 | eleven arrows fc
3) cd elá nguema            | 2 - 3 | 0 - 3 1 | primeiro de agosto
4) lprc oilers              | 1 - 0 | 1 - 3 | mighty blackpool
5) asc police               | 1 - 1 | 1 - 1 | as real bamako
6) port autonome            | 0 - 0 | 0 - 0 | sporting clube da praia
7) saint - george sa        | 2 - 1 | 0 - 3 | al ittihad
8) saint - louis fc         | 1 - 3 | 1 - 4 | young africans
9) sahel sc                 | 2 - 1 | 2 - 1 | postel sport
10) tourbillon fc           | 0 - 0 | 1 - 1 | forces armées ca

Evidence 2: Count teams by their goals scored in the 1st leg
SQL query used (exact):

SELECT goals_scored, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM (
  SELECT (regexp_match("1st leg", '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)\s*$'))[1]::int AS goals_scored
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "1st leg" ~ '^\s*\d+\s*-\s*\d+\s*$'
  UNION ALL
  SELECT (regexp_match("1st leg", '^\s*(\d+)\s*-\s*(\d+)\s*$'))[2]::int AS goals_scored
  FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "1st leg" ~ '^\s*\d+\s*-\s*\d+\s*$'
) sub
GROUP BY goals_scored
ORDER BY team_count DESC, goals_scored ASC;

Results:
- goals_scored = 1, team_count = 8
- goals_scored = 0, team_count = 6
- goals_scored = 2, team_count = 3
- goals_scored = 3, team_count = 3

Interpretation: At least 8 teams scored exactly 1 goal in the 1st leg—clearly more than two teams sharing the same score.

Evidence 3: List of teams with their 1st leg goals (one row per team)
The SQL query I ran (exactly) was:

SELECT team_name, SUM(goals) AS goals_scored
FROM (
  SELECT "team 1" AS team_name,
         NULLIF(regexp_replace(split_part("1st leg",' - ',1),'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'')::int AS goals
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "1st leg" IS NOT NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "team 2" AS team_name,
         NULLIF(regexp_replace(split_part("1st leg",' - ',2),'[^0-9]','', 'g'),'')::int AS goals
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  WHERE "1st leg" IS NOT NULL
) t
GROUP BY team_name
ORDER BY goals_scored DESC, team_name;

Selected results highlighting the repeated score of 1 goal:
- al ittihad — 1
- as real bamako — 1
- asc police — 1
- botswana defence force xi — 1
- lprc oilers — 1
- mbabane highlanders — 1
- postel sport — 1
- saint - louis fc — 1
(8 teams with 1 goal; additional teams have 0, 2, or 3 goals.)

Additional check (alternative interpretation): If “same score during the 1st leg” were taken to mean “same scoreline across matches,” the most frequent 1st leg scorelines occur twice (e.g., 0 - 0, 1 - 1, 2 - 1).
SQL query used to produce these results:
SELECT regexp_replace(trim("1st leg"), '\s*-\s*', ' - ', 'g') AS normalized_scoreline,
       count(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE "1st leg" IS NOT NULL AND trim("1st leg") <> ''
GROUP BY regexp_replace(trim("1st leg"), '\s*-\s*', ' - ', 'g')
ORDER BY match_count DESC, normalized_scoreline;

Results (normalized_scoreline — match_count):
- 0 - 0 — 2
- 1 - 1 — 2
- 2 - 1 — 2
- 1 - 0 — 1
- 1 - 3 — 1
- 2 - 3 — 1
- 3 - 0 — 1

Final assessment
- Using the per-team goals interpretation, the claim is supported: more than two teams share the same score (e.g., 8 teams scored 1 goal in the 1st leg).

Assumptions
- I interpreted “teams having the same score during the 1st leg” as teams scoring the same number of goals in the first leg (e.g., multiple teams scoring 1). Under this interpretation, the claim is true. If one instead requires identical match scorelines across different matches, the most frequent 1st leg scoreline occurs twice, not more than twice, but that’s about matches rather than teams.
