Claim interpreted: The statement appears to conflate two assertions: (a) that only one party fielded a candidate where the candidate was Harry Lane Englebright (R), and (b) that the race had results 57.6% for the Republican and 42.4% for the Democrat with candidates Harry Lane Englebright (R) and N. E. West (D).

What the data shows:
- Evidence that Harry Lane Englebright was unopposed (i.e., only one party fielded a candidate) in 1942, California’s 2nd district:
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, result, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Harry Lane Englebright%';
  Result (1 row):
  - district: california 2
  - incumbent: harry lane englebright
  - party: republican
  - result: re - elected
  - candidates: harry lane englebright (r) unopposed
  Conclusion from this result: Englebright ran unopposed in CA-2 in 1942; thus “only 1 party with candidate” is accurate for his race.

- Evidence about the 57.6% vs 42.4% figures and N. E. West (D):
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, candidates
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%West%' OR candidates ILIKE '%N. E. West%';
  Result (1 row):
  - california 22: "john j phillips (r) 57.6% n e west (d) 42.4%"
  Conclusion from this result: The 57.6% vs 42.4% race involved John J. Phillips (R) vs N. E. West (D) in California’s 22nd district—not Harry Lane Englebright. Englebright’s race did not have those percentages because he was unopposed.

Assessment:
- True component: Englebright’s 1942 race had only one candidate/party (unopposed) in CA-2.
- False component: Associating the 57.6% vs 42.4% result and N. E. West (D) with Englebright is incorrect; those figures pertain to John J. Phillips in CA-22.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1942 U.S. House elections (consistent with the available table) and is attempting to describe candidate-party and result details for races involving Harry Lane Englebright and N. E. West.
