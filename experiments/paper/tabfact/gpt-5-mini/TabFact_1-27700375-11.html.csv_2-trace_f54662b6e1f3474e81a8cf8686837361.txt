Conclusion: Supported by the available season data, the Nets’ only win in the dataset occurred at the Prudential Center.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact), schema public, table: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season.

Schema understanding
- Table public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).
- The score column encodes outcome with a leading “W” or “L”. The location attendance column holds venue name followed by attendance.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to understand formats
- SQL: SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt shows formats and one win:
  • game=77, date="april 5", team="minnesota", score="w 107 - 105 (ot)", location attendance="prudential center 13461"
  • All other shown rows (games 75, 76, 78, 79, 80, 81) have score starting with "l" and various venues including Prudential Center and others.

2) Count total games
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
- Result: total_games = 7

3) Count total wins (score starts with 'W')
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_by_score FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE score ILIKE 'W%';
- Result: wins_by_score = 1

4) List the win(s) with venue
- SQL: SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE score ILIKE 'W%';
- Result: { game: 77, date: 'april 5', team: 'minnesota', score: 'w 107 - 105 (ot)', location attendance: 'prudential center 13461', record: '24 - 53' }

5) Extract venue name of wins (remove trailing attendance number)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT array_to_string((string_to_array("location attendance",' '))[1:array_length(string_to_array("location attendance",' '),1)-1],' ') AS venue FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE score ILIKE 'W%';
- Result: venue = "prudential center"

Assessment
- Within this dataset (7 games), there is exactly one win, and it occurred at the Prudential Center. This directly supports the claim that “the Nets’ only win come at the Prudential Center.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the scope of the available dataset (the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season table entries provided here, which contain 7 games).
- Wins are identified by score values beginning with 'W' and venue names are parsed by removing the trailing attendance from the location attendance field.
