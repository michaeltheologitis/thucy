Summary
The claim states that the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis is positive. I verified this against the available IMViC biochemical test dataset.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: A single table public.imvic in the TabFact database (public schema).
- Schema (public.imvic):
  - species (text)
  - indole (text)
  - methyl red (text)
  - voges - proskauer (text)
  - citrate (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve the methyl red result for Proteus mirabilis
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT species, "methyl red" FROM public.imvic WHERE species ILIKE 'Proteus mirabilis';
- Result:
  - species: proteus mirabilis
  - methyl red: positive

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly reports: Proteus mirabilis — methyl red: positive. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Species name matching used a case-insensitive exact match (ILIKE) for “Proteus mirabilis”.
- The public.imvic table is treated as authoritative for standard IMViC test outcomes.
