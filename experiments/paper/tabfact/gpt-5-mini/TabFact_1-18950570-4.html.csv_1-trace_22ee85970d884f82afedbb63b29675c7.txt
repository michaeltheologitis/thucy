Summary
- The table public.my_info_table contains Brazil age-group population breakdowns and an “unspecified 0.0034%” column. The row for age group 15 - 17 reports a population of 10 357 874 and an unspecified count of 170. The value 321 appears for the 15 - 19 age group, not for 15 - 17. Therefore, linking 321 with the 15 - 17 population of 10 357 874 is not supported by the data.

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) List key columns for all rows
SQL:
SELECT "age group", "brazil 100% (percent of the population)", "unspecified 0.0034%" FROM public.my_info_table;
Results (relevant excerpts shown as returned):
- age group: 15 - 17; brazil 100% (percent of the population): 10 357 874; unspecified 0.0034%: 170
- age group: 15 - 19; brazil 100% (percent of the population): 16 990 872 (8 , 91%); unspecified 0.0034%: 321
(Additional rows included in the query output: population; 0 - 4; 5 - 9; 10 - 14; 18 - 19; 20 - 24; 25 - 29; 30 - 34; 35 - 39; 40 - 44; 45 - 49; 50 - 54; 55 - 59; 60 - 69.)

2) Retrieve only the row for age group 15 - 17
SQL:
SELECT "age group", "brazil 100% (percent of the population)", "unspecified 0.0034%" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "age group" = '15 - 17';
Result:
- age group: 15 - 17
- brazil 100% (percent of the population): 10 357 874
- unspecified 0.0034%: 170

3) Retrieve only the row for age group 15 - 19
SQL:
SELECT "age group", "brazil 100% (percent of the population)", "unspecified 0.0034%" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "age group" = '15 - 19';
Result:
- age group: 15 - 19
- brazil 100% (percent of the population): 16 990 872 (8 , 91%)
- unspecified 0.0034%: 321

Assessment of the claim’s components
- “Brazil population (100%) for age 15 - 17 is 10 357 874”: Supported by Query 2.
- “Unspecified 0.0034% is 321 (for age 15 - 17)”: Contradicted. Query 2 shows 170 for 15 - 17; the value 321 belongs to age 15 - 19 (Query 3).
- The statement appears to conflate the 15 - 17 population figure with the 15 - 19 unspecified count.

Conclusion
- The population figure 10 357 874 for age 15 - 17 is correct.
- The unspecified value 321 does not correspond to age 15 - 17; it corresponds to age 15 - 19. For 15 - 17, the unspecified value is 170.

Assumptions made due to ambiguous phrasing
- I interpreted the claim as asserting that for Brazil’s age group 15 - 17, the total population is 10 357 874 and the “unspecified 0.0034%” count is 321. I verified these against the only available authoritative data source (public.my_info_table).
