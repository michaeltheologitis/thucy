Claim to verify: "in 2012, jiyal shin earn 36517 less than yani tseng in 2011"

Data source explored: postgres_tabfact17 (TabFact) → public.women_s_british_open
Relevant fields: year, champion, purse, winner's share

Evidence from data
1) Retrieve winners and winner's share for 2012 and 2011
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, purse, "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2012, 2011) ORDER BY year DESC;
Results:
- 2012 — jiyai shin — purse: 2750000 — winner's share: 428650
- 2011 — yani tseng — purse: 2500000 — winner's share: 392133

2) Compute difference (2012 winner's share − 2011 winner's share)
Executed SQL:
SELECT ( (SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2012) - (SELECT "winner 's share" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year=2011) ) AS difference;
Result:
- difference = 36517

Analysis
- In 2012, Jiyai Shin’s winner’s share (428,650) is 36,517 more than Yani Tseng’s 2011 winner’s share (392,133).
- The magnitude (36,517) matches the claim, but the direction is reversed: the data shows “more than,” not “less than.”

Conclusion
- The statement “Jiyai Shin earned 36,517 less than Yani Tseng” is not supported. She actually earned 36,517 more.

Assumptions
- “jiyal shin” refers to “Jiyai Shin.”
- “earn” is interpreted as the winner’s share for the Women’s British Open, based on the available table.
