Data sources discovered
- TabFact (PostgreSQL) > public schema > table: beyond_software
  Columns: title (text), genre (text), "c = 64" (text), "zx spectrum" (text), others (text), year (bigint), format (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Direct test of the claim (exact title and arcade genre)
- Purpose: Find any row where title is exactly "Kriegspiel" (case-insensitive) and genre is "Arcade" (case-insensitive).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, genre, year, format FROM public.beyond_software WHERE lower(title) = 'kriegspiel' AND lower(genre) = 'arcade';
- Result: no rows returned.

2) Broader search for context (titles containing 'krieg')
- Purpose: See if any "Kriegspiel"-like title exists and what its recorded genre/year are.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, genre, year, format, (genre ILIKE '%arcade%') AS genre_contains_arcade
FROM public.beyond_software
WHERE title ILIKE '%krieg%';
- Result (1 row):
  • title: kriegspiel | genre: strategy | year: 1983 | format: tape | genre_contains_arcade: false

3) Exact title, regardless of genre, and distinct years
- Purpose: Confirm existence and year(s) for exactly "kriegspiel".
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, genre, year, format FROM public.beyond_software WHERE lower(title) = 'kriegspiel' ORDER BY year, genre;
- Result (1 row):
  • title: kriegspiel | genre: strategy | year: 1983 | format: tape

- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS distinct_years FROM public.beyond_software WHERE lower(title) = 'kriegspiel';
- Result: distinct_years = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows no entry for title "Kriegspiel" in the arcade genre at all. The only matching title found (kriegspiel) is categorized under the strategy genre in the year 1983.
- Therefore, the claim that there is only one year (1983) with a title of "Kriegspiel" in the genre arcade is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "title of kriegspiel" as an exact, case-insensitive match to the title field. To guard against minor variations, I also searched for titles containing the substring 'krieg'.
- Interpreted "genre arcade" as requiring the genre field to equal or contain 'arcade' case-insensitively.
- Relied solely on the public.beyond_software table in the TabFact database, treated as authoritative per instructions.
