Claim to verify: “neither singapore, mongolia, nor myanmar have win a gold medal for wushu at the asian game.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact9), schema public.
- Relevant table identified: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games with columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Evidence
Executed SQL (as returned by the tool):
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
WHERE lower(nation) LIKE '%singapore%'
   OR lower(nation) LIKE '%mongol%'
   OR lower(nation) LIKE '%myanmar%'
   OR lower(nation) LIKE '%burma%';

Query result (nation — gold, silver, bronze, total):
- myanmar (mya) — gold: 1, silver: 1, bronze: 2, total: 4
- singapore (sin) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 5, total: 5
- mongolia (mgl) — gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 3, total: 3

Assessment
- Singapore: 0 gold medals in Wushu at the Asian Games (supported by data).
- Mongolia: 0 gold medals in Wushu at the Asian Games (supported by data).
- Myanmar: 1 gold medal in Wushu at the Asian Games (contradicts the claim).

Conclusion
Because Myanmar has won a gold medal in Wushu at the Asian Games, the claim that none of the three countries (Singapore, Mongolia, Myanmar) have won a Wushu gold at the Asian Games is not true overall.

Assumptions
- “Asian game” refers to the Asian Games multi-sport event.
- Nation naming variations were handled by partial, case-insensitive matching (e.g., “myanmar (mya)”; also checked for “Burma”). The table is treated as authoritative for Wushu medal counts at the Asian Games.
