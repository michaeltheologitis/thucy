What I verified
- Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that there exists an EPCOR company (subsidiary) with a group equity shareholding of 99%.

Data sources consulted
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table discovered: public.klm (columns: company, type, principal activities, incorporated in, group 's equity shareholding)

Evidence gathered
1) Locate any EPCOR-related company records and inspect the group equity shareholding.
Executed SQL:
SELECT company, type, "principal activities", "incorporated in", "group 's equity shareholding" FROM public.klm WHERE company ILIKE '%EPCOR%';
Result:
- company: epcor
  type: subsidiary
  principal activities: maintenance
  incorporated in: netherlands
  group 's equity shareholding: 100%

2) Check whether any record shows a 99% group equity shareholding (to see if any EPCOR record could match or if 99% exists at all).
Executed SQL (with supporting column check):
- Verify column names:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='klm';
Returned columns: company (text), type (text), principal activities (text), incorporated in (text), group 's equity shareholding (text)

- Search for shareholding values starting with 99:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.klm WHERE "group 's equity shareholding" LIKE '99%';
Result: 0

- Check exact literal 99%:
SELECT count(*) FROM public.klm WHERE "group 's equity shareholding" = '99%';
Result: 0

Findings
- The only EPCOR record in the dataset shows a group’s equity shareholding of 100%, not 99%.
- There are no records in the table with a group’s equity shareholding value of 99% at all.

Conclusion
- The claim that an EPCOR company has a group equity shareholding of 99% is not supported by the available data; the relevant EPCOR record shows 100%.

Assumptions made
- “Company of EPCOR” was interpreted as a subsidiary entry whose company name contains “EPCOR”.
- “Group equity shareholding” refers to the literal column "group 's equity shareholding" in public.klm and the figures are compared as stored text values.
- If the claim refers to a different EPCOR entity not present in this dataset, it would be outside the scope of the accessible data sources used here.
