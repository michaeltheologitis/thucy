Summary conclusion
The available data shows that there are 3 C-95 (Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante) aircraft of Brazilian origin currently in service (within the Uruguayan Air Force dataset). This directly supports the claim.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact20), public schema
- Table: public.uruguayan_air_force
- Relevant columns: aircraft (text), origin (text), type (text), versions (text), in service (text)

Executed queries and evidence
1) Initial targeted search for “C-95” in the aircraft name (no rows)
SQL:
SELECT type, aircraft, origin, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%C-95%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%C95%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%C 95%';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Filter for Brazilian-origin aircraft (locates the relevant entry explicitly showing C-95 and the in-service count)
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, type, origin, versions, "in service" FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE origin ILIKE '%brazil%' OR origin ILIKE '%brasil%';
Results:
- aircraft: embraer emb 110 bandeirante | type: transport / utility | origin: brazil | versions: c - 95 | in service: 3
- aircraft: embraer emb 120 brasilia     | type: transport           | origin: brazil | versions: emb 120  | in service: 1

3) Exact-row retrieval to confirm version and in-service count
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, type, origin, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft = 'embraer emb 110 bandeirante';
Returned row:
- {"aircraft":"embraer emb 110 bandeirante","type":"transport / utility","origin":"brazil","versions":"c - 95","in service":"3"}

4) Broader corroboration (pattern search across aircraft/origin)
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, type, origin, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%Bandeirante%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%EMB%' OR origin ILIKE '%Brazil%';
Returned rows (excerpt):
- {"aircraft":"embraer emb 110 bandeirante","type":"transport / utility","origin":"brazil","versions":"c - 95","in service":"3"}
- {"aircraft":"embraer emb 120 brasilia","type":"transport","origin":"brazil","versions":"emb 120","in service":"1"}

Assessment
- The uruguayan_air_force table lists the Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante (Brazilian origin) with version “c - 95” and an in-service count of 3. This matches the claim that there are 3 C-95 aircraft of Brazilian origin currently in service.

Assumptions
- Context is the Uruguayan Air Force, as that is the only available data source. 
- “C-95” corresponds to the version designation of the Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante stored as “c - 95” in the dataset.
- “Currently in service” is taken directly from the table’s “in service” field.
