Claim: “robert garrett and james connolly represent the same country.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11)
- Table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
- Relevant columns: athlete (text), nation (text)

Evidence
1) Query to find rows for both athletes
Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, nation FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Garrett%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Connolly%';
Results (abridged to show values):
- {"athlete":"james connolly", "nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett", "nation":"united states"}
- Additional duplicate rows also showed the same mappings.

2) Query to confirm distinct athlete–nation mappings
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, nation FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Garrett%' OR athlete ILIKE '%Connolly%';
Results:
- {"athlete":"james connolly", "nation":"united states"}
- {"athlete":"robert garrett", "nation":"united states"}

Analysis
- Both Robert Garrett and James Connolly are listed with the nation value "united states" in the authoritative table of multiple Olympic medalists. Therefore, the data shows they represented the same country.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data: both athletes are recorded with nation = United States.

Assumptions
- Athlete matching was performed case-insensitively (ILIKE) to handle lowercase storage of names in the table.
