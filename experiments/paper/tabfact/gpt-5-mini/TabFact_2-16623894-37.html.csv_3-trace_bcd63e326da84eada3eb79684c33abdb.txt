Claim interpreted: For the tie where team 2 is Werder Bremen, the 2nd leg score is less than the 1st leg score.

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact7 / TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Step 1: Identify the tie involving Werder Bremen as team 2
Executed SQL and result:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg"
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%werder%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%werder%';

Result:
- valencia | werder bremen | 1 - 1 | 4 - 4 | 5 - 5 ( a )

Step 2: Compute numeric goals per leg to compare 2nd leg vs 1st leg
Executed SQL and result:
WITH s AS (
  SELECT "team 1" AS team1, "team 2" AS team2, "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg,
    regexp_replace("1st leg", '\\s*[-–]\\s*', '-') AS first_norm,
    regexp_replace("2nd leg", '\\s*[-–]\\s*', '-') AS second_norm
  FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
  WHERE "team 2" ILIKE '%Werder%'
)
SELECT team1, team2, "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg,
  CAST(split_part(first_norm, '-', 1) AS integer) AS first_leg_team1_goals,
  CAST(split_part(first_norm, '-', 2) AS integer) AS first_leg_team2_goals,
  CAST(split_part(second_norm, '-', 1) AS integer) AS second_leg_team1_goals,
  CAST(split_part(second_norm, '-', 2) AS integer) AS second_leg_team2_goals,
  (CAST(split_part(first_norm, '-', 1) AS integer) + CAST(split_part(first_norm, '-', 2) AS integer)) AS first_leg_total_goals,
  (CAST(split_part(second_norm, '-', 1) AS integer) + CAST(split_part(second_norm, '-', 2) AS integer)) AS second_leg_total_goals
FROM s;

Computed values:
- team 1: valencia; team 2: werder bremen
- 1st leg: 1 - 1 → first_leg_team1_goals=1, first_leg_team2_goals=1, first_leg_total_goals=2
- 2nd leg: 4 - 4 → second_leg_team1_goals=4, second_leg_team2_goals=4, second_leg_total_goals=8

Assessment against the claim
- Comparing total match scores per leg: 2nd leg total (8) is not less than 1st leg total (2). It is greater.
- Comparing team 2 (Werder Bremen) goals per leg: 2nd leg (4) is not less than 1st leg (1). It is greater.
- Comparing team 1 goals per leg: 2nd leg (4) is not less than 1st leg (1). It is greater.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim. For the tie where team 2 is Werder Bremen (Valencia vs Werder Bremen), the 2nd leg scoreline (4-4) is higher, not lower, than the 1st leg scoreline (1-1) by any reasonable interpretation.

Assumptions made
- "team 2 of werder bremen" refers to the row where the "team 2" column equals (case-insensitively) Werder Bremen.
- "score" refers to either the scoreline total per leg or the goals by the specified team per leg; both interpretations were tested and contradict the claim.
