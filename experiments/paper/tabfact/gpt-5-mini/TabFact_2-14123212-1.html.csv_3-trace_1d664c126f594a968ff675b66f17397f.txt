Claim to verify: “w293al have the highest erp w, whereas w264bf have the lowest erp w.”

Data source overview
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing table: whlp.
- whlp columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (double precision), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text).

Evidence from the data
1) Retrieve ERP for the two specified call signs (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE lower("call sign") IN ('w293al','w264bf') ORDER BY lower("call sign");
Result rows:
- {"call sign":"w264bf","erp w":2}
- {"call sign":"w293al","erp w":80}

2) Determine the minimum and maximum ERP values across the table and ensure no NULLs:
SQL:
SELECT MIN("erp w") AS min_erp, MAX("erp w") AS max_erp FROM public.whlp;
Result: {"min_erp": 2, "max_erp": 80}

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_erp_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "erp w" IS NULL;
Result: {"null_erp_count": 0}

3) List the call signs at the extreme ERP values:
SQL:
SELECT MAX("erp w") AS max_erp, MIN("erp w") AS min_erp FROM whlp;
Result:
- max_erp = 80, min_erp = 2

SQL:
SELECT "call sign" FROM whlp WHERE "erp w" = 80 ORDER BY "call sign";
Result rows:
- w293al

SQL:
SELECT "call sign" FROM whlp WHERE "erp w" = 2 ORDER BY "call sign";
Result rows:
- w264bf

Conclusion
- Highest ERP W in the dataset is 80 W, and it belongs to w293al.
- Lowest ERP W in the dataset is 2 W, and it belongs to w264bf.
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “erp w” as the column "erp w" (ERP in watts) in the whlp table, with no additional filtering.
- Treated call sign matching as case-insensitive.
- Verified extremes across the full whlp table without considering ties beyond what the data reported (no ties present).
