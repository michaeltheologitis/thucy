Claim to verify: “25 - 26 january 2003 be the only game play in 2003.”

Data discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL TabFact database with one table in the public schema: tsuyoshi_fujita(season text, event type text, location text, format text, date text, rank bigint).

Method
- Search the table for any entries where the date contains the year 2003 and list them.
- Count how many 2003 entries exist to check whether 25–26 January 2003 was the only one.

Evidence
1) List all rows with date containing 2003
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "event type", location, format, rank FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';
Results:
- date: 25 - 26 january 2003; event type: grand prix; location: hiroshima; format: extended; rank: 7
- date: 12 - 13 july 2003; event type: grand prix; location: bangkok; format: standard; rank: 1

2) Count rows with date containing 2003
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_2003
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';
Result:
- count_2003 = 2

Assessment
- The data shows two events in 2003: 25–26 January 2003 (Grand Prix Hiroshima) and 12–13 July 2003 (Grand Prix Bangkok). Therefore, 25–26 January 2003 was not the only “game play” (event) recorded in 2003 in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “game play” as an event entry in the tsuyoshi_fujita table, based on the available data and column semantics (event type, location, format, date).
