Claim interpreted: “The destination of a train that calls at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria is Skegness.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL). Accessible table: public.my_info_table with columns: departure (text), going to (text), calling at (text), arrival (double), operator (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify any service calling at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("calling at") LIKE '%boston%' AND lower("calling at") LIKE '%sleaford%' AND lower("calling at") LIKE '%nottingham victoria%';
Result:
- departure: 17.03 | going to: nottingham victoria | calling at: boston , sleaford , nottingham victoria | arrival: 18.46 | operator: gnr
Interpretation: The matching service’s destination is “nottingham victoria,” not Skegness.

2) Test whether any service calls at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria AND is going to Skegness
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "calling at" ILIKE '%Boston%'
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Sleaford%'
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Nottingham Victoria%'
  AND "going to" ILIKE '%Skegness%';
Result: match_count = 0
SQL (retrieve rows):
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "calling at" ILIKE '%Boston%'
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Sleaford%'
  AND "calling at" ILIKE '%Nottingham Victoria%'
  AND "going to" ILIKE '%Skegness%';
Result: no rows returned
Interpretation: There is no record of a train that calls at those three stations and is destined for Skegness.

3) Context check: what services have destination Skegness?
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "going to" ILIKE '%skegness%';
Result: 5
SQL (list):
SELECT "calling at", "going to" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "going to" ILIKE '%skegness%';
Results (5 rows):
- calling at: "wainfleet , skegness" | going to: "skegness"
- calling at: "skegness" | going to: "skegness"
- calling at: "skegness" | going to: "skegness"
- calling at: "skegness" | going to: "skegness"
- calling at: "wainfleet , skegness" | going to: "skegness"
Interpretation: Destination Skegness services in this table do not list Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria among their calling points.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts the claim. The only record that calls at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria has destination “nottingham victoria,” and no record with those calling points goes to Skegness.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as asserting the destination equals Skegness for a service that calls at Boston, Sleaford, and Nottingham Victoria.
- Matching used case-insensitive substring search (ILIKE/LIKE). Column names contain spaces and were quoted accordingly.
- Treated the available TabFact table as authoritative within this environment.
