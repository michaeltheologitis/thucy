Data source explored: TabFact database (public schema) with table public.ned_kelly_awards. Relevant columns: year, best teenage / young adult, reader 's vote, best non - fiction, lifetime achievement.

Evidence 1 — Reader's vote value for 2011:
SQL:
SELECT "reader 's vote" FROM ned_kelly_awards WHERE year = 2011;
Result:
reader 's vote = na

Evidence 2 — Full 2011 row to check other categories:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE year = 2011;
Result (one row):
- year: 2011
- best teenage / young adult: na
- reader 's vote: na
- best non - fiction: na
- lifetime achievement: na

Assessment:
- The value for reader's vote in 2011 is "na".
- It is not the only category with "na" in 2011; all listed categories are "na" that year.

Conclusion: The claim that "na only win the reader's vote in 2011" is contradicted by the data—"na" appears across all categories in 2011, not only reader's vote.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as asserting that in 2011, only the reader's vote category had the value "na" (or that "na" was the sole winner only in reader's vote).
