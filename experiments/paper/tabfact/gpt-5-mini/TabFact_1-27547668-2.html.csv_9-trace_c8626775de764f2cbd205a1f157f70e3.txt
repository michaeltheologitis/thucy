Claim to verify: “steve scaini direct one more episode than mike clattenburg.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact29)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (columns include: title, "directed by", etc.)

Evidence 1 — Per-director episode counts (handles multiple directors per episode)
Executed SQL:
SELECT director_clean, COUNT(*) AS episodes_count
FROM (
  SELECT trim(both ' ' FROM regexp_replace(director, '\s*\(.*\)$', '')) AS director_clean
  FROM (
    SELECT regexp_split_to_table(regexp_replace(lower("directed by"), '\band\b', ',', 'g'), ',') AS director
    FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
    WHERE "directed by" IS NOT NULL
  ) t
) s
WHERE director_clean IN ('steve scaini', 'mike clattenburg')
GROUP BY director_clean
ORDER BY episodes_count DESC;

Result:
- mike clattenburg — 2 episodes
- steve scaini — 1 episode

Evidence 2 — Director tokens and associated episode titles
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT lower(trim(token)) AS director_token, title
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes,
LATERAL regexp_split_to_table("directed by", '\s*(?:,|and)\s*') AS token
WHERE token IS NOT NULL AND token <> ''
  AND (lower(token) ILIKE '%clattenburg%' OR lower(token) ILIKE '%scaini%')
ORDER BY director_token, title;

Result:
- mike clattenburg → “duchess of george”, “fathers and sons”
- steve scaini → “a horse divided”

Evidence 3 — Raw rows for transparency
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "directed by" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Mike Clattenburg%' OR "directed by" ILIKE '%Steve Scaini%';

Result:
- fathers and sons — mike clattenburg
- duchess of george — mike clattenburg
- a horse divided — steve scaini

Conclusion
- In the available dataset (Republic of Doyle episodes), Mike Clattenburg directed 2 episodes and Steve Scaini directed 1 episode. Therefore, Steve Scaini did not direct one more episode than Mike Clattenburg; in fact, he directed one fewer.

Assumptions
- Verification is performed against the accessible, authoritative dataset of Republic of Doyle episodes. If the claim was intended to compare their entire careers across all shows, that broader data is not present in the available source; conclusions here pertain to this dataset specifically.
