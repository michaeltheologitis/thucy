What I checked:
- The claim asserts that for the season “2010 - 11 (detail)”, the title is “47th” and the runner-up is “Waseda”.

Data source consulted:
- TabFact PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: all_japan_university_rugby_championship (columns: title, season, winner, score, runner - up, venue, attendance).

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
SQL:
SELECT season, title, winner, "runner - up" FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season ~ '2010.*11';

Result (season, title, winner, runner-up):
- season: 2010 - 11 details
- title: 47th
- winner: teikyo
- runner-up: waseda

Assessment:
- Title: The data shows “47th”, matching the claim.
- Runner-up: The data shows “waseda”, matching the claim (case-insensitive).
- Season label: The table records “2010 - 11 details” (plural), while the claim says “detail”; this is a minor wording difference and does not affect the substance.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Treated “detail” vs. “details” as equivalent.
- Case-insensitive matching for entity names (e.g., “waseda” vs. “Waseda”).
- Interpreted “season 2010 - 11” to match any text containing 2010 followed by 11 in the season field.
