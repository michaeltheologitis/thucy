Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results
- Key columns used: 
  - average % of vote per candidate (double precision)
  - average votes per candidate (bigint)
  - year (text)
  - % of total vote (double precision)

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Exact equality search for 3.29 average % of vote per candidate
SQL:
SELECT "year", "average votes per candidate", "% of total vote", "average % of vote per candidate" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE "average % of vote per candidate" = 3.29;
Result:
- year: 2005, average votes per candidate: 1416, % of total vote: 1.04, average % of vote per candidate: 3.29

2) Nearby range to account for rounding (3.285 to 3.295)
SQL:
SELECT "year", "average votes per candidate", "% of total vote", "average % of vote per candidate" FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE "average % of vote per candidate" BETWEEN 3.285 AND 3.295 ORDER BY "average % of vote per candidate";
Result:
- year: 2005, average votes per candidate: 1416, % of total vote: 1.04, average % of vote per candidate: 3.29

3) Rounding check to two decimals
SQL:
SELECT "year", "average votes per candidate", "% of total vote", "average % of vote per candidate", ROUND("average % of vote per candidate"::numeric,2) AS rounded_2 FROM public.green_party_of_england_and_wales_election_results WHERE ROUND("average % of vote per candidate"::numeric,2) = 3.29 ORDER BY "average % of vote per candidate";
Result:
- year: 2005, average votes per candidate: 1416, % of total vote: 1.04, average % of vote per candidate: 3.29, rounded_2: 3.29

Assessment
- The dataset contains one row where the average % of vote per candidate is exactly 3.29 (year 2005). In that row, the average votes per candidate is 1416. This aligns with the claim that for a 3.29% average, the number of votes per candidate is 1416.0.

Assumptions
- “3.29% average” refers to the column “average % of vote per candidate.”
- “number of vote per candidate” refers to “average votes per candidate.”
- The decimal “.0” is treated as a formatting/precision representation of the integer value 1416.
