Claim to verify:
- "the league / cup competition, play against the swindon wildcat, be lost 4 - 2 with neil liddiard name as man of the match"

What the data shows:
- In the available dataset (public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season), there is a home game against the Swindon Wildcats in the competition labeled "league / cup" with result "won 4 - 2" and Man of the Match "neil liddiard".
- Therefore, the opponent, competition label, scoreline, and Man of the Match align with the claim, but the result was a win, not a loss.

Evidence queries and results:
1) List all games vs Swindon to see context
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, competition, venue, result, "man of the match"
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Swindon%';
- Result:
  1) date: 8th | opponent: swindon wildcats | competition: league / cup | venue: away | result: won 6 - 3 | man of the match: lukas smital
  2) date: 9th | opponent: swindon wildcats | competition: league / cup | venue: home | result: won 4 - 2 | man of the match: neil liddiard

2) Target the 4-2 game specifically
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, competition, venue, result, "man of the match" FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Swindon%' AND result LIKE '%4 - 2%';
- Result (raw row):
{"date":"9th","opponent":"swindon wildcats","competition":"league / cup","venue":"home","result":"won 4 - 2","man of the match":"neil liddiard"}

Conclusion:
- The claim is incorrect on the match outcome (it was a win, not a loss). Other details (competition label, opponent, scoreline, Man of the Match) are correct.

Assumptions made:
- "swindon wildcat" is interpreted as "Swindon Wildcats".
- The claim refers to the Guildford Flames 2008–09 season data, which is the authoritative dataset available in the connected data source.
