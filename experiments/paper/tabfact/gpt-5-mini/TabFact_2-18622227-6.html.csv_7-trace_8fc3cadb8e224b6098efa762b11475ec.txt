Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that Wimbledon has the same result in 1986 and 1999 (within the available tennis results data). Based on the accessible data source (TabFact: public.katrina_adams), this corresponds to the Wimbledon row (tournament) and its entries for years 1986 and 1999 for player Katrina Adams.

Data source discovery:
- Discovered PostgreSQL instance: postgres_tabfact19 (TabFact), schema public.
- Relevant table: katrina_adams (columns include tournament, "1986", "1999", etc.).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Direct check of Wimbledon values for 1986 and 1999
SQL:
SELECT "1986", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'wimbledon';
Result:
- 1986 = 'a'
- 1999 = '1r'
Conclusion: Not the same.

2) Context: list all tournaments with 1986 and 1999 values
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM katrina_adams ORDER BY tournament;
Results (abbrev.):
- australian open: 1986 = a, 1999 = 1r
- french open: 1986 = a, 1999 = 1r
- grand slam tournaments: 1986 = grand slam tournaments, 1999 = grand slam tournaments
- us open: 1986 = 1r, 1999 = 1r
- wimbledon: 1986 = a, 1999 = 1r

3) Explicit Wimbledon row via case-insensitive match
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM katrina_adams WHERE lower(tournament) LIKE '%wimbledon%';
Result:
- tournament: wimbledon, 1986: a, 1999: 1r

Conclusion:
- For Wimbledon, the 1986 and 1999 results differ ('a' vs '1r'). Therefore, the claim that they are the same is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “the wimbledon” refers to the Wimbledon row in the katrina_adams table (tennis tournament results for Katrina Adams). The table uses lowercase tournament names and abbreviations (e.g., 'a' for absent, '1r' for first round).
