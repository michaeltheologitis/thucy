Summary
- I explored the available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with one relevant table: t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league. This table contains columns "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", and "agg", which directly relate to two-legged football ties.

Schema examined
- Database: postgres_tabfact4 (TabFact)
- Table: t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
  FROM t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
  WHERE lower("team 1") LIKE '%panathinaikos%'
     OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%panathinaikos%';

- Result:
  - team 1: panathinaikos; team 2: standard liège; 1st leg: 1 - 3; 2nd leg: 0 - 1; agg: 1 - 4

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “the first leg score be 1 - 3 for the match with a team 1 of panathinaikos”
  - Team 1 is Panathinaikos: Supported. The row shows team 1 = panathinaikos.
  - First leg score is 1 - 3: Supported. The "1st leg" column shows 1 - 3.

Conclusion
- The data explicitly shows a tie where Panathinaikos is listed as team 1 and the first leg score is 1 - 3. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “team 1” refers to the "team 1" column in the t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league table.
- The claim pertains to the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League tie present in the accessible dataset.
- “first leg score” corresponds to the "1st leg" column value.
