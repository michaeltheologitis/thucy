Summary
- Claim interpreted: There exist 3 different baseball games with a final score of 8 - 1.
- Data scope: The only accessible dataset contains the 2006 Texas Rangers season game log. Within this dataset, there are exactly 3 games recorded with a score of 8 - 1.

Evidence from the data
1) Data source discovery
- Available source: TabFact (postgres_tabfact3) with one relevant table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season

2) Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
  Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

3) Sample rows (to understand score formatting)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
ORDER BY date NULLS LAST
LIMIT 20;
Key observation: Score values are stored as text in the format 'X - Y'. The sample included two instances of '8 - 1', indicating the format to search.

4) Count and list games with score '8 - 1'
SQL executed (list):
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '8 - 1' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- september 4 — athletics
- september 17 — angels
- september 18 — mariners

SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '8 - 1';
Result: 3

5) Check if the reverse format '1 - 8' exists
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '1 - 8';
Result: 0

Conclusion
- Within the accessible dataset (2006 Texas Rangers season), there are three distinct games with the final score recorded as 8 - 1. This matches the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions
- Because only the 2006 Texas Rangers season table is available, I interpret the claim within this dataset’s scope.
- “Final score be 8 - 1” is matched exactly to the score text '8 - 1' (with spaces and hyphen) in the score column.
- “3 different baseball game” means three distinct rows (games) in this table, which are on three different dates and against three opponents.
