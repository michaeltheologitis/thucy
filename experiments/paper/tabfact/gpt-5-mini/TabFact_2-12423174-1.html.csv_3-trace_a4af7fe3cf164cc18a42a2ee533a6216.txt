Claim interpreted: The user asserts that AS Porto-Novo scored no point against Victoria Club Mokanda (interpreted as either no goals or no points from the two-legged tie).

Data source exploration:
- Available dataset: TabFact PostgreSQL, table public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs), with columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg.

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Porto%' OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Mokanda%' OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Victoria%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Porto%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Mokanda%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Victoria%';

- Result row:
  team 1: as porto novo
  agg: 0 - 3
  team 2: victoria club mokanda
  1st leg: 0 - 1
  2nd leg: 0 - 2

Assessment:
- AS Porto-Novo lost both legs 0-1 and 0-2 (aggregate 0-3) in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs tie versus Victoria Club Mokanda.
- Therefore, AS Porto-Novo scored 0 goals across the tie and, if considering match points (3/1/0), earned 0 points from two losses.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Score no point" is interpreted as either (a) scored no goals, or (b) earned no match points across the tie. The dataset confirms both interpretations for this specific 1971 tie.
