Claim: “larisa latyna have 7 less medal than carl osbum.”

Data sources discovered
- postgres_tabfact15 (public schema)
- Table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (columns: medal count, date, athlete, nation, sport, record medal event)

Evidence from the database
1) Locate the two athletes (case-insensitive matching)
SQL:
SELECT athlete, "medal count" FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%larisa%' AND athlete ILIKE '%latynin%';
Returned rows:
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 13
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 14
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 15
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 16
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 17
- athlete: larisa latynina, medal count: 18

SQL:
SELECT athlete, "medal count" FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%carl%' AND athlete ILIKE '%osburn%';
Returned rows:
- athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 8
- athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 9
- athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 10
- athlete: carl osburn, medal count: 11

2) Compute maximum medal totals per athlete and the differences
SQL:
SELECT athlete, MAX("medal count") AS max_medals
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE athlete IN ('Larisa Latynina','Carl Osburn')
GROUP BY athlete;
Returned rows:
- athlete = Larisa Latynina, max_medals = 18
- athlete = Carl Osburn,    max_medals = 11

SQL:
WITH m AS (
  SELECT athlete, MAX("medal count") AS max_medals
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE athlete IN ('Larisa Latynina','Carl Osburn')
  GROUP BY athlete
)
SELECT
  (SELECT max_medals FROM m WHERE athlete='Larisa Latynina') - (SELECT max_medals FROM m WHERE athlete='Carl Osburn') AS larisa_minus_carl,
  (SELECT max_medals FROM m WHERE athlete='Carl Osburn') - (SELECT max_medals FROM m WHERE athlete='Larisa Latynina') AS carl_minus_larisa;
Returned row:
- larisa_minus_carl = 7, carl_minus_larisa = -7

Conclusion
- Larisa Latynina’s total medals (max) = 18.
- Carl Osburn’s total medals (max) = 11.
- Difference = 7 in favor of Larisa Latynina. Therefore, the claim that “Larisa has 7 less medals than Carl” is false; she actually has 7 more medals than Carl.

Assumptions
- “larisa latyna” refers to Larisa Latynina; “carl osbum” refers to Carl Osburn.
- “medal” refers to total Olympic medals per athlete, taken as the maximum medal count recorded for each athlete in the table.
