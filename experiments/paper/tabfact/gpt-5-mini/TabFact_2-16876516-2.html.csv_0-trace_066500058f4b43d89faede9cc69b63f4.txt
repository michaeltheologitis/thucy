Data sources checked
- Connected database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table (via schema discovery): public.salmson with columns: name, cyl, bore, capacity, power, weight

What I checked
1) Whether a row for “9 adr” exists and what its bore value is.
2) Whether “every other bore in the table” matches that same value (i.e., distinct bore values across the table).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all rows (name, bore) to inspect bore values across the table
SQL executed:
SELECT name, bore FROM public.salmson;
Observed result (excerpt; all rows showed identical bore):
- 9 ad | mm (in)
- 9 adb | mm (in)
- 9 adr | mm (in)
- 7 ac | mm (in)
- 9 ac | mm (in)
- 9 nc | mm (in)
- 9 nct | mm (in)
- 9 ab | mm (in)
- 9 na | mm (in)
- 9 nas | mm (in)
- 18 ab | mm (in)
- 18 abs | mm (in)

2) Retrieve the bore for the exact model name “9 adr” (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT name, bore FROM salmson WHERE LOWER(name) = '9 adr';
Result:
[{"name":"9 adr","bore":"mm (in)"}]

3) Count total rows to understand table scope
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM salmson;
Result:
[{"total_rows":12}]

4) Count distinct bore values and list them with counts
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT bore) AS distinct_bore_count FROM salmson;
Result:
[{"distinct_bore_count":1}]

SQL executed:
SELECT bore, COUNT(*) AS count FROM salmson GROUP BY bore ORDER BY count DESC, bore;
Result:
[{"bore":"mm (in)","count":12}]

Conclusion
- The row for “9 adr” exists and its bore is “mm (in)”.
- Every row in the salmson table has the same bore value “mm (in)”.
Therefore, the claim that “9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table” is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- I matched the model name case-insensitively using LOWER(name) = '9 adr'.
- Interpreted “every other bore in the table” as all rows in public.salmson.
