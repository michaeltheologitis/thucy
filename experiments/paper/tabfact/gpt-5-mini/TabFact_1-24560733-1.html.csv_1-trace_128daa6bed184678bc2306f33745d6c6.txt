Claim to verify: "the wildcat never score more than 7 in any game they lose"

Data sources discovered
- Verified a single accessible data source: TabFact PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "wildcats points" (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

Evidence collected
1) Full table inspection to see game-by-game results and points
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents, record FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
- Key returned rows (losses highlighted):
  • Game 1 vs ole miss — result: loss — wildcats points: 7 — opponents: 14
  • Game 7 vs 18 alabama — result: loss — wildcats points: 0 — opponents: 13
  • Game 10 vs tennessee — result: loss — wildcats points: 6 — opponents: 13
  Observation: In losses, the Wildcats scored 7, 0, and 6 points respectively; none exceed 7.

2) Count of losses and whether any loss had >7 points
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS loss_count FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE result = 'loss';
  Result: loss_count = 3

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses_with_wildcats_gt_7 FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE result = 'loss' AND "wildcats points" > 7;
  Result: losses_with_wildcats_gt_7 = 0

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX("wildcats points") AS max_wildcats_in_loss FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE result = 'loss';
  Result: max_wildcats_in_loss = 7

Conclusion
- Based on the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football data, in every loss the team scored no more than 7 points. The data shows three losses with points of 7, 0, and 6, and zero losses with more than 7 points scored.

Assumptions
- "wildcat" refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team represented in the available table (1947 season), as no other teams or seasons are present in the accessible data.
- "score more than 7" is interpreted as the value in the "wildcats points" column.
- "game they lose" is identified by result = 'loss'.
