Claim interpreted: The user appears to ask whether Cooperstown is (or should be) famous for the Blanchard Bridge.

Data sources explored
- Discovered one accessible PostgreSQL database: postgres_tabfact7, schema public, table my_info_table(name text, listed text, location text, county text, type text).

Evidence
1) Locate any entry for “Blanchard Bridge”
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Blanchard Bridge%' OR location ILIKE '%Blanchard Bridge%';
Result:
- name: "blanchard bridge"; listed: "1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25"; location: "blanchard"; county: "traill"; type: "pratt through truss"
Interpretation: Blanchard Bridge is located in Blanchard, Traill County—not Cooperstown.

2) Check what, if anything, is associated with Cooperstown
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, listed, location, county, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%cooperstown%' OR location ILIKE '%cooperstown%';
Result:
- name: "romness bridge"; listed: "1997 - 02 - 27"; location: "cooperstown"; county: "griggs"; type: "pratt through truss"
Interpretation: The bridge associated with Cooperstown in this dataset is the Romness Bridge, and Cooperstown is in Griggs County.

3) Corroborate the county/location context for Blanchard
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, location, county, type, listed FROM public.my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE '%blanchard%' OR county ILIKE '%traill%';
Results (subset shown):
- blanchard bridge; location: blanchard; county: traill; type: pratt through truss; listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25
- (other Traill County bridges listed, confirming the county context)
Interpretation: The Blanchard Bridge is consistently tied to Blanchard in Traill County.

Conclusion
- The data shows Blanchard Bridge is in Blanchard, Traill County. Cooperstown (in Griggs County) is associated with the Romness Bridge, not the Blanchard Bridge. Therefore, the statement that Cooperstown is (or is famous) for the Blanchard Bridge is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Cooper town” is interpreted as “Cooperstown,” and given the dataset context, specifically Cooperstown, North Dakota.
- “Famous for” is taken to mean “associated with/known for” in terms of the bridge located in or attributed to that town within this dataset.
