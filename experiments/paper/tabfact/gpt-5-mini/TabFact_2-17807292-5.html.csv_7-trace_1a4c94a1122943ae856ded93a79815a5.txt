Conclusion: The claim is mostly incorrect per the available data. In the 2008 PGA Championship table, J B Holmes (United States) and Henrik Stenson (Sweden) tied for second place at −1 to par, not for third place at +1 to par. Nationalities are correct; finishing position and to-par are not.

Data sources discovered
- Postgres instance (postgres_tabfact6), schema public, with one relevant table: t_2008_pga_championship

Schema evidence
- Table: t_2008_pga_championship(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Verify Holmes and Stenson positions and to-par
SQL:
SELECT place, player, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Holmes%' OR player ILIKE '%Stenson%';
Result:
- place: t2, player: j b holmes, to par: - 1
- place: t2, player: henrik stenson, to par: - 1
Interpretation: Both are tied for 2nd at −1 to par.

2) Verify nationalities
SQL:
SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE regexp_replace(lower(player),'[^a-z0-9 ]','','g') IN ('j b holmes','henrik stenson');
Result:
- player: j b holmes | country: united states | place: t2 | to par: - 1
- player: henrik stenson | country: sweden | place: t2 | to par: - 1
Interpretation: Nationalities match the claim.

3) Check if any third-place ties exist in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY place;
Result:
- place values present: 1, t2, t4, t7, t9
Interpretation: No 't3' (tie for third) exists in this leaderboard.

4) Who finished at +1 to par?
SQL:
SELECT place, player, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE "to par" = '+ 1';
Result:
- sergio garcía — place: t4 — to par: + 1
- pádraig harrington — place: t4 — to par: + 1
- charlie wi — place: t4 — to par: + 1
Interpretation: +1 to par corresponds to T4, not T3.

Overall assessment
- Correct: J B Holmes is from the United States; Henrik Stenson is from Sweden.
- Incorrect: They tied for third at +1 to par. Data shows they tied for second at −1 to par, and +1 to par corresponds to T4 finishers.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the 2008 PGA Championship because the available database contains only this tournament’s leaderboard. All conclusions are grounded in that dataset.
- Matching for player names allowed for spacing/punctuation variants (e.g., “J B Holmes”).
