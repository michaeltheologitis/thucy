Summary of verification
Claim: “game 4 have a location attendance of at&t center 20491 and the series be 1 - 1.”
Finding: The data for the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season contradicts all parts of this claim for game 4.

Data source discovery
- Database: postgres_tabfact22 (TabFact)
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  - Columns include: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), location attendance (text), series (text)

Evidence
1) Game 4 details
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", series
FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
WHERE game = 4;
Result:
- game: 4
- date: april 25
- team: dallas
- score: l 90 - 99 (ot)
- location attendance: american airlines center 20829
- series: 1 - 3
Conclusion: For game 4, the venue was American Airlines Center with attendance 20,829; the series stood at 1–3. Not AT&T Center, not 20,491, and not 1–1.

2) Where the series is 1–1
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", series
FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
WHERE series = '1 - 1';
Result:
- game: 2, date: april 20, team: dallas, location attendance: at&t center 18797, series: 1 - 1
Conclusion: The series was 1–1 after game 2 at AT&T Center with attendance 18,797.

3) All AT&T Center entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", series
FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%at&t center%';
Results:
- game 1: at&t center 18797, series 0 - 1
- game 2: at&t center 18797, series 1 - 1
- game 5: at&t center 20829, series 1 - 4
Conclusion: No AT&T Center entry lists 20,491; the AT&T Center attendances shown are 18,797 (games 1 and 2) and 20,829 (game 5).

4) Occurrences of 20,491 attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", series
FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
WHERE "location attendance" LIKE '%20491%';
Result:
- game: 3, date: april 23, team: dallas, location attendance: american airlines center 20491, series: 1 - 2
Conclusion: Attendance 20,491 appears for game 3 at American Airlines Center, not for game 4 and not at AT&T Center.

Overall assessment
- Game 4 location: American Airlines Center (not AT&T Center)
- Game 4 attendance: 20,829 (not 20,491)
- Game 4 series: 1–3 (not 1–1)
The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “game 4” as the row where game = 4 in t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season (2008–09 Spurs playoffs vs. Dallas).
