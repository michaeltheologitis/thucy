Claim interpreted: “90 games have been played in the series for the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy.”

Data source consulted: PostgreSQL database TabFact (schema: public), table: my_info_table (columns: teams, name, trophy, first met, games played, series record).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Checked for an exact match on the trophy name “Sawhorse Dollar Trophy” (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT teams, name, trophy, "first met", "games played", "series record" 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE LOWER(trophy) = LOWER('Sawhorse Dollar Trophy');
Result: 0 rows (no exact match).

2) Performed a broader search for any trophy containing “Sawhorse” (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT teams, name, trophy, "first met", "games played", "series record"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE trophy ILIKE '%Sawhorse%';
Result (1 row):
- teams: dartmouth - princeton
- name: none
- trophy: sawhorse dollar
- first met: 1897
- games played: 90 games
- series record: 43 - 43 - 4

3) Cross-check: Sum the components of the series record to validate total games:
SQL:
SELECT trophy, "games played", "series record",
       (trim(split_part("series record", '-', 1))::int + trim(split_part("series record", '-', 2))::int + trim(split_part("series record", '-', 3))::int) AS total_series_games
FROM my_info_table
WHERE trophy ILIKE '%Sawhorse%';
Result (1 row):
- trophy: sawhorse dollar
- games played: 90 games
- series record: 43 - 43 - 4
- total_series_games: 90

Assessment:
- The table records the “sawhorse dollar” rivalry (Dartmouth–Princeton) with “games played: 90 games,” and the series record components sum to 90. This supports the claim that 90 games have been played in the series associated with the Sawhorse Dollar trophy (noting the table omits the word “Trophy” in the trophy field).

Assumptions:
- “Sawhorse Dollar Trophy” refers to the “sawhorse dollar” entry in the data (minor naming variation).
- The user’s phrasing “90 game be play for the series” is interpreted as “90 games have been played in the series.”
