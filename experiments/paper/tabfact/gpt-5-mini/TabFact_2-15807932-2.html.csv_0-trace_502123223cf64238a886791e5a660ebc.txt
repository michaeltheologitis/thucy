Claim to verify: “there's no country that have 1 gold and a rank smaller than 2.”

Data source discovery:
- Accessible database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1967_world_judo_championships(rank bigint, nation text, gold bigint, silver bigint, bronze bigint, total bigint)

Evidence from data:
1) Inspect table ordered by rank to see top entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, rank, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships
ORDER BY rank
LIMIT 100;

Result rows:
- {nation: "japan", rank: 1, gold: 5, silver: 3, bronze: 4, total: 12}
- {nation: "netherlands", rank: 2, gold: 1, silver: 1, bronze: 1, total: 3}
- {nation: "germany", rank: 3, gold: 0, silver: 1, bronze: 2, total: 3}
- {nation: "south korea", rank: 3, gold: 0, silver: 1, bronze: 2, total: 3}
- {nation: "soviet union", rank: 5, gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 2, total: 2}
- {nation: "great britain", rank: 6, gold: 0, silver: 0, bronze: 1, total: 1}
Interpretation: The only nation with gold = 1 is “netherlands,” which has rank = 2 (not < 2). The rank-1 nation (“japan”) has 5 golds.

2) Directly test the condition gold = 1 AND rank < 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships
WHERE gold = 1 AND rank < 2;

Result:
- {cnt: 0}
Interpretation: There are zero nations with exactly 1 gold and rank less than 2.

Conclusion: The data shows no country with 1 gold and rank < 2. The claim is supported by the evidence in the available dataset.

Assumptions:
- “rank smaller than 2” interpreted as the numeric condition rank < 2 (i.e., rank equal to 1 only).
- Verification scope is limited to the available table t_1967_world_judo_championships in the TabFact public schema.
