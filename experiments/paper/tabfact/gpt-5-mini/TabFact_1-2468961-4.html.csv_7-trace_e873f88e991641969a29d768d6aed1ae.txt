Summary of findings
- The only matching episode title in the available dataset that corresponds to “feel forty” is “feeling forty.”
- Its original air date is March 25, 1994 (which is after October 1, 1993).
- Its production code is 445471, not 455451.0.

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Enumerate tables (to confirm data source and scope)
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';

2) Search for episode titles containing both ‘feel’ and ‘forty’ (case-insensitive) and retrieve air date and production code
SQL:
SELECT "title", "original air date", "production code"
FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
WHERE lower("title") LIKE '%feel%' AND lower("title") LIKE '%forty%';

Result:
- Title: feeling forty
- Original air date: march 25 , 1994
- Production code: 445471

3) Parse and compare the original air date to confirm it is after 1993-10-01
SQL:
WITH cleaned AS (
  SELECT
    title,
    "original air date",
    "production code",
    trim(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\[.*?\\]|\\(.*?\\)', '', 'g')) AS date_text
  FROM public.list_of_step_by_step_episodes
  WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%feel%' AND lower(title) LIKE '%forty%'
), cleaned2 AS (
  SELECT *, regexp_replace(date_text, '[[:space:]]*,[[:space:]]*', ', ', 'g') AS clean_date_text FROM cleaned
)
SELECT
  title,
  "original air date",
  date_text,
  clean_date_text,
  to_date(initcap(clean_date_text), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date,
  (to_date(initcap(clean_date_text), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') > DATE '1993-10-01') AS after_1993_10_01,
  "production code"
FROM cleaned2;

Result (for “feeling forty”):
- parsed_date = 1994-03-25
- after_1993_10_01 = true
- production code = 445471

Conclusion
- The condition “debut after October 1, 1993” is satisfied (air date is March 25, 1994).
- The claimed production code 455451.0 does not match the data-backed production code 445471.

Assumptions
- “feel forty” refers to the episode whose title contains the words “feel” and “forty,” which in the dataset appears as “feeling forty.”
- “debut” corresponds to the “original air date” field in the dataset.
- Production code is stored as an integer; the user’s value includes a decimal (.0) but is compared on its integer value.
