Claim to verify: “the original airdate of episode 7 be 19 april 2008.”

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact23)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.my_info_table
- Columns: "episode" (bigint), "series" (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check whether an entry exists for episode = 7
- SQL:
  SELECT count(*) AS cnt FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "episode" = 7;
- Result: cnt = 0 (no matching rows). This table contains no row with episode number 7.

2) Find any row with original air date equal to “19 april 2008” (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("original air date") = '19 april 2008';
- Result:
  episode = 31, series = 5, episode title = "the homecoming", original air date = "19 april 2008".
  This shows that the date “19 april 2008” corresponds to episode 31, not episode 7, in this dataset.

3) Establish the episode range present in the table (to understand coverage)
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(episode) AS min_episode, MAX(episode) AS max_episode, MIN(series) AS min_series, MAX(series) AS max_series FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: min_episode = 27, max_episode = 51; min_series = 1, max_series = 25.
  This confirms that episodes 1–26 (including episode 7) are not present in this table.

Conclusion
- The available data contains no row for episode 7, so the claim cannot be confirmed within this dataset. Moreover, the specific date “19 april 2008” is associated with episode 31 in the data, not episode 7. Within the authoritative scope of the accessible data, the claim is contradicted/unsupported.

Assumptions
- “episode 7” refers to the numeric value in the "episode" column of public.my_info_table.
- The “original airdate” refers to the "original air date" column’s text value.
- Exact textual date match was used (case-insensitive) for “19 april 2008.”
