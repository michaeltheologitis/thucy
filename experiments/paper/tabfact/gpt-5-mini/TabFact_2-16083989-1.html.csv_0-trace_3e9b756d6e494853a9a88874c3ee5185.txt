Data sources explored:
- Database: postgres_tabfact2 (public schema)
- Relevant table: imvic(species, indole, methyl red, voges - proskauer, citrate)

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT species, "voges - proskauer" FROM imvic WHERE lower(species) = 'proteus mirabilis';
- Result:
  species: proteus mirabilis
  voges - proskauer: negative

Assessment:
- The imvic table explicitly lists Proteus mirabilis with a “negative” value in the “voges - proskauer” column, directly supporting the claim that Proteus mirabilis has a negative Voges–Proskauer reading.

Assumptions:
- Species name matching was performed case-insensitively to ensure alignment with the stored value.
