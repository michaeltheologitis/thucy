Claim to verify: "the number of tournament play in 2000 be 2"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: postgres_tabfact16 (schema: public)
- Relevant table identified: public.casey_martin

Schema context for public.casey_martin:
- Columns: year (bigint), tournaments played (bigint), cuts made (bigint), wins (bigint), best finish (text), earnings (bigint), money list rank (text)

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "tournaments played", * FROM public.casey_martin WHERE year = 2000;
- Result row:
  { "year": 2000, "tournaments played": 29, "cuts made": 14, "wins": 0, "best finish": "t - 17", "earnings": 143248, "money list rank": "179" }

Analysis:
- The value of "tournaments played" for the year 2000 is 29, not 2. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in the authoritative source.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "tournament play" to mean the "tournaments played" column in the public.casey_martin table for the year 2000. If a different entity or metric was intended (e.g., playoff appearances or wins), the table still does not support the value 2 for 2000 (wins = 0).
