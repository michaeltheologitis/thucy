Summary of verification steps
1) Discovered available data source(s)
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Result: One PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact14) with public schema and table t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a.

2) Inspected schema
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Findings: Table public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a has columns: stage (bigint), winner (text), general classification (text), points classification (text), mountains classification (text), combination classification (text), team classification (text).

3) Counted how many stages each team led the team classification
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "team classification" AS team, COUNT(*) AS stages_led
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
GROUP BY "team classification"
ORDER BY stages_led ASC, team ASC;
- Results:
  • team htc - columbia — stages_led = 3
  • team katusha — stages_led = 7
  • caisse d'epargne — stages_led = 11

4) Identified the minimum count and the team(s) with that minimum
- Executed SQL to compute minimum:
SELECT MIN(stages_led) AS min_count FROM (
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS stages_led
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
  GROUP BY "team classification"
) sub;
- Result: min_count = 3

- Executed SQL to list team(s) with the minimum count:
SELECT "team classification" AS team, COUNT(*) AS stages_led
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
GROUP BY "team classification"
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
  SELECT MIN(cnt) FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a GROUP BY "team classification"
  ) s
)
ORDER BY team;
- Results:
  • team htc - columbia — stages_led = 3

Conclusion
- The least number of stages led in the team classification is 3, but that belongs to team htc - columbia, not caisse d'epargne.
- caisse d'epargne appears 11 times, which is not the least.

Assumptions
- The column "team classification" denotes the team leading that classification after each stage of the 2010 Vuelta a España, and the table covers all stages for that event.
