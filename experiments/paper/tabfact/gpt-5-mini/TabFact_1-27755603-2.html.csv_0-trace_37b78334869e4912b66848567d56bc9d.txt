Claim to verify: Greg Monroe had a team-high 8 rebounds against Charlotte on October 16, and that result made the Pistons’ record 2–4.

What I checked and found:
- The 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season table includes a row for October 16 vs. Charlotte where the “high rebounds” entry is “greg monroe (8)” and the team record after the game is “2 - 4”. This directly matches the claim.

Direct evidence (exact SQL and results):
1) Targeted lookup of the October 16 game vs. Charlotte
SQL executed:
SELECT date, team, score, "high rebounds", record
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE date ILIKE '%October 16%' AND team ILIKE '%Charlotte%';
Result:
- date: october 16 | team: charlotte | score: l 94 - 97 (ot) | high rebounds: greg monroe (8) | record: 2 - 4

2) Context sample (overview of available rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high rebounds", record
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
LIMIT 20;
Relevant returned row:
- game: 6 | date: october 16 | team: charlotte | score: l 94 - 97 (ot) | high rebounds: greg monroe (8) | record: 2 - 4

Conclusion:
- The data confirm that Greg Monroe led the Pistons with 8 rebounds against Charlotte on October 16, and the team’s record became 2–4 after that game.

Assumptions noted:
- The table t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season corresponds to the Pistons’ 2010–11 season schedule (including preseason), and the date strings (e.g., “october 16”) refer to that season’s calendar without explicitly listing the year.
- The “team” column refers to the opponent for that game, consistent with the table context and entries.
