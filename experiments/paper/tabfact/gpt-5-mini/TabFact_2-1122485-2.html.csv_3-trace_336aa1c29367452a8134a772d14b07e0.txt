Scope and data source discovery
- Discovered data source: TabFact (public schema, PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table identified: t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (columns: driver, constructor, laps, time / retired, grid)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Determine the maximum laps value and how many drivers achieved it
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- Result: max_laps = 79

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_drivers_with_max FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
- Result: num_drivers_with_max = 4

Interpretation: There is a 4-way tie for the most laps at 79.

2) Determine the minimum laps value and how many drivers achieved it
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- Result: min_laps = 5

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_drivers_with_min FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MIN(laps) FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
- Result: num_drivers_with_min = 2

Interpretation: There is a 2-way tie for the fewest laps at 5.

3) Cross-check: distribution of laps values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT laps, COUNT(*) AS drivers_count FROM t_1971_south_african_grand_prix GROUP BY laps ORDER BY laps DESC;
- Key results (laps : drivers_count):
  79 : 4
  ...
  5  : 2

Conclusion
- The data show a 4-way tie for the highest laps count at 79 and a 2-way tie for the lowest laps count at 5, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- Each row represents a single driver’s result in the 1971 South African Grand Prix.
- “Most lap” and “least amount” are interpreted as the maximum and minimum values of the laps column among drivers in this table.
