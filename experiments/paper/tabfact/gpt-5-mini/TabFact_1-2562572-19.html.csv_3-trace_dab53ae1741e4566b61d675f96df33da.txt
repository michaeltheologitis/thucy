Scope and data sources
- Database inspected: TabFact (postgres_tabfact1), schema: public
- Table used: public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina
- Relevant columns: settlement, type, population (2011)

Key checks and results
1) Gardinovci’s 2011 population
- Result: settlement: gardinovci; type: village; population (2011): 1297
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT settlement, type, "population (2011)" 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE settlement ILIKE 'Gardinovci';

2) Minimum non-null 2011 population in the table
- Result: 1114
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("population (2011)") AS min_population 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE "population (2011)" IS NOT NULL;

3) Settlement(s) with the minimum 2011 population
- Result: lok — village — 1114
- Executed SQL (step 1 to compute min for clarity):
  SELECT MIN("population (2011)") AS min_pop 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE "population (2011)" IS NOT NULL;
- Executed SQL (step 2 to list settlements at that minimum):
  SELECT settlement, type, "population (2011)" 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE "population (2011)" = 1114 
  ORDER BY settlement;

4) Context: smallest populations present in the dataset
- The table has 5 rows with non-null 2011 population values. Ordered by smallest population:
  lok — village — 1114; gardinovci — village — 1297; mošorin — village — 2569; šajkaš — village — 4374; titel — town — 5294
- Executed SQL (top 10 smallest, non-null):
  SELECT settlement, type, "population (2011)" 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE "population (2011)" IS NOT NULL 
  ORDER BY "population (2011)" ASC, settlement ASC 
  LIMIT 10;
- Executed SQL (count of non-null rows):
  SELECT count(*) 
  FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
  WHERE "population (2011)" IS NOT NULL;

Conclusion
- Gardinovci’s 2011 population is 1297. The smallest 2011 population in the table is 1114 (Lok). Therefore, Gardinovci does not have the smallest population in 2011 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Have the smallest population in 2011” is interpreted relative to the settlements present in the table public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina.
- Comparisons use non-null 2011 population values as the basis for “smallest.”
