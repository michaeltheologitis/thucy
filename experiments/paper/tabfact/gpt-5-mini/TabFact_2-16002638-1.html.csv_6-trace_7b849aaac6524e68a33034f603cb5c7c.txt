Claim to verify: “the dundee hurricane have 4 losing season , 2003 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008”

Data source discovery:
- Connected dataset: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.dundee_hurricanes (columns: season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes)

Schema details used:
- season (bigint) — year identifier
- wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint) — season record fields

Evidence 1 — Identify all losing seasons (losses > wins):
- SQL (executed):
  SELECT season, wins, losses, ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE losses > wins ORDER BY season;
- Result:
  - 2006 — wins: 3, losses: 4, ties: 0
  - 2009 — wins: 2, losses: 6, ties: 1
- Count query (executed):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS losing_seasons_count FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE losses > wins;
- Result:
  - losing_seasons_count: 2

Evidence 2 — Check the specific years named in the claim (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008):
- SQL (executed):
  SELECT season, wins, losses, ties
  FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
  WHERE season IN (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008)
  ORDER BY season;
- Results:
  - 2003 — 6–4–0 (winning record)
  - 2005 — 5–5–0 (non-losing, .500)
  - 2007 — 9–1–0 (winning record)
  - 2008 — 5–2–3 (winning record)

Assessment:
- The data shows only two losing seasons: 2006 and 2009. The years listed in the claim (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) are not losing seasons.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Dundee Hurricanes did not have losing seasons in 2003, 2005, 2007, or 2008, and they have only 2 losing seasons in the dataset (2006 and 2009), not 4.

Assumptions:
- “Losing season” defined as losses > wins (ties do not convert a non-losing record into a losing one). This interpretation aligns with common sports record conventions and is applied consistently across queries.
