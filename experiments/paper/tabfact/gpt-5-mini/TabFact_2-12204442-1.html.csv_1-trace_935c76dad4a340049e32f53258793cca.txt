Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected their schema to locate relevant tables about drop-tower attractions.
- Queried the identified table to retrieve rows with drop heights around 200 feet and examined the corresponding recorded speeds.

Data sources explored
- TabFact (PostgreSQL) — public schema
  - Table: drop_tower_scream_zone
  - Columns: park, tower height, drop height, speed, model, opened, height requirement

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Context query (full table to see relevant entries)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM drop_tower_scream_zone;

Key returned rows (excerpt):
- park: canada 's wonderland | tower height: 230feet | drop height: 200feet | speed: 62 mph | model: giant drop | opened: 1997
- park: california 's great america | tower height: 224feet | drop height: 207feet | speed: 62 mph | model: giant drop | opened: march 1996

Interpretation: The table shows a Giant Drop model at Canada’s Wonderland with a drop height of 200 feet and a recorded speed of 62 mph.

2) Targeted verification query (exactly matching model and 200-foot drop)
Executed SQL:
SELECT park, model, "drop height", speed
FROM drop_tower_scream_zone
WHERE lower(model) = 'giant drop' AND "drop height" ILIKE '%200%';

Result:
- park: canada 's wonderland | model: giant drop | drop height: 200feet | speed: 62 mph

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly records a Giant Drop model with a 200-foot drop height and speed of 62 mph. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim that the speed of the giant drop attraction with a drop height of 200 feet is 62 mph is supported by the evidence in the drop_tower_scream_zone table.

Assumptions
- “Giant drop attraction” refers to entries where model = “giant drop” (generic ride model), not necessarily a specific branded ride name.
- Heights are in feet and speeds in mph as stored in the table text fields.
