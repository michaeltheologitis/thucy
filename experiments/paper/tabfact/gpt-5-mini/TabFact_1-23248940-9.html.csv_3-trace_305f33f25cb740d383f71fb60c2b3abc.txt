Claim interpreted: Raymond Felton led his team in assists on 4 different occasions.

What data I checked
- Available data sources discovery showed one accessible database (TabFact) with a relevant NBA table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season. This table logs each game in the Charlotte Bobcats’ 2009–10 season, including a “high assists” field that names the team’s assist leader(s) for that game.

Evidence from the data
1) Find all games where Felton was the Bobcats’ high-assists leader
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", "team", "high assists", "game" FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Felton%' ORDER BY "date";
Returned rows:
- {date: "february 22", game: 55, team: "la clippers", high assists: "boris diaw , raymond felton (9)"}
- {date: "february 24", game: 56, team: "utah", high assists: "raymond felton (5)"}
- {date: "february 6", game: 49, team: "new orleans", high assists: "raymond felton (7)"}
- {date: "february 9", game: 50, team: "washington", high assists: "raymond felton (5)"}

2) Count how many such games
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS felton_games FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Felton%';
Result:
- {felton_games: 4}

3) List the matching games in game-number order
SQL executed:
SELECT "game", "date", "team" AS opponent, "high assists" AS player_string FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Felton%' ORDER BY "game";
Returned rows:
- {game: 49, date: "february 6", opponent: "new orleans", player_string: "raymond felton (7)"}
- {game: 50, date: "february 9", opponent: "washington", player_string: "raymond felton (5)"}
- {game: 55, date: "february 22", opponent: "la clippers", player_string: "boris diaw , raymond felton (9)"}
- {game: 56, date: "february 24", opponent: "utah", player_string: "raymond felton (5)"}

Conclusion
- In the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season data available, Raymond Felton is listed as the team’s high-assists leader in 4 different games (one of which is a shared lead). This directly supports the claim as phrased.

Assumptions noted
- Because only the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season table is available in the accessible data, I interpret “led the team in assists 4 different times” to refer to game-level team-leading occurrences within that season. The claim could also be interpreted across teams or seasons, but no broader data was available here to test those interpretations.
