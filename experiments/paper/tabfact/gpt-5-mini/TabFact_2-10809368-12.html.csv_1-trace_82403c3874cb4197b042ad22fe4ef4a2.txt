Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Richmond hosted Fitzroy at Punt Road Oval. Given the available data environment (a table for the 1946 VFL season), I verify this within that season.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered data source: TabFact PostgreSQL database (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_1946_vfl_season with columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date".

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL (case-insensitive match to account for lowercase data values):
  SELECT "home team", "away team", venue, date
  FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" ILIKE 'richmond'
    AND "away team" ILIKE 'fitzroy';

- Result row:
  home team: richmond
  away team: fitzroy
  venue: punt road oval
  date: 13 july 1946

Conclusion: The dataset shows that Richmond hosted Fitzroy at Punt Road Oval on 13 July 1946, which supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Verification is constrained to the available 1946 VFL season table. I interpret the claim as pertaining to this season given the accessible data.
- "Host" is interpreted as the home team listed in the match record.
- Team and venue names are matched case-insensitively due to lowercase entries in the dataset.
