Claim to verify: “the away team score be 9.12 (66) play against fitzroy.”

Data sources discovered
- One PostgreSQL database (public schema). Relevant table identified via schema inspection:
  - public.t_1975_vfl_season with columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) List all 1975 VFL matches involving Fitzroy and inspect the away team scores
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue
  FROM t_1975_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%fitzroy%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%fitzroy%'
  ORDER BY date;
- Result:
  [{"date":"19 april 1975","home team":"fitzroy","home team score":"12.13 (85)","away team":"collingwood","away team score":"12.15 (87)","venue":"junction oval"}]
- Observation: The only Fitzroy match present shows the away team score as 12.15 (87), not 9.12 (66).

2) Direct check: any Fitzroy-involved match where the away team score equals exactly '9.12 (66)'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT count(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  WHERE (lower(trim("home team"))='fitzroy' OR lower(trim("away team"))='fitzroy')
    AND "away team score" = '9.12 (66)';
- Result:
  [{"match_count":0}]
- Observation: No Fitzroy-involved matches in this dataset have the away team score equal to 9.12 (66).

3) Where does the away team score 9.12 (66) occur in 1975, if at all?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT string_agg(date || ' | ' || "home team" || ' | ' || "home team score" || ' | ' || "away team" || ' | ' || "away team score" || ' | ' || venue, ' || ') AS matches
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  WHERE "away team score" = '9.12 (66)';
- Result:
  [{"matches":"19 april 1975 | carlton | 14.18 (102) | north melbourne | 9.12 (66) | princes park"}]
- Observation: The only occurrence of an away team scoring 9.12 (66) is Carlton vs North Melbourne (away: North Melbourne), which does not involve Fitzroy.

Conclusion
- Based on the available 1975 VFL season table, there is no match involving Fitzroy where the away team score is 9.12 (66). The sole occurrence of an away score of 9.12 (66) in the dataset is in a match that does not involve Fitzroy. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope is limited to the available table public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 season). Team matching used case-insensitive comparisons (ILIKE / lower). The score string was matched exactly as '9.12 (66)'. The database provided is treated as authoritative within its scope.
