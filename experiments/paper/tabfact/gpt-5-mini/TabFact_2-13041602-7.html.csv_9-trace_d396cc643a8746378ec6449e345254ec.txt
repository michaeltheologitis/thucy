Claim being checked: "In the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season, every game was attended by more than 30,000 people."

Answer: No. The data shows multiple games with attendance at or below 30,000.

Data source discovery
- Connected database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact17)
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of games in the table
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: total_games = 27

2) Number of games with attendance > 30,000
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_gt_30000 FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE attendance > 30000;
Result: games_gt_30000 = 8

3) Minimum and maximum attendance observed
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance, MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: min_attendance = 13173, max_attendance = 37756

4) List of all games where attendance <= 30,000
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE attendance <= 30000 ORDER BY attendance ASC;
Results (date, opponent, attendance):
- september 29, reds, 13173
- september 6, reds, 13351
- september 26, reds, 14412
- september 7, reds, 15886
- september 5, reds, 16144
- september 11, astros, 17392
- september 9, astros, 18130
- september 2, padres, 18231
- september 4, padres, 20042
- september 25, cardinals, 20150
- september 15, diamondbacks, 20741
- september 30, pirates, 20922
- september 28, reds, 21181
- september 23, cardinals, 22472
- september 13, diamondbacks, 23708
- september 14, diamondbacks, 23793
- september 10, astros, 24437
- september 1, padres, 24785
- september 27, reds, 28031

5) Direct check: Did every game exceed 30,000?
SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN COUNT(*) = SUM(CASE WHEN attendance > 30000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS all_games_gt_30000 FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: all_games_gt_30000 = false

Conclusion based on evidence
- Of the 27 games in the dataset, only 8 had attendance greater than 30,000; 19 did not.
- Therefore, the claim that every 2005 Milwaukee Brewers game exceeded 30,000 in attendance is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “More than 30,000” is interpreted as strictly greater than 30,000 (> 30000).
- The table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season is taken as authoritative for the portion of the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season it covers. While it appears to contain a subset of games (dates shown are in September), the presence of any games at or below 30,000 is sufficient to falsify the universal claim (“every game”).
