Claim to verify: "Olga Govortsova advance to the third round in the French Open 5 year in a row."

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table identified via schema inspection: public.olga_govortsova with columns tournament (text) and year columns "2007"–"2011" (text).

Schema evidence:
- Table: public.olga_govortsova
  - Columns: tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011"
  - Each row is a tournament; each year column holds the result string for that year.

Evidence queries and results:
1) Full table view to read French Open results across years
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM public.olga_govortsova ORDER BY tournament;
Key returned rows (as provided by the database):
- tournament: french open | 2007: a | 2008: 3r | 2009: 3r | 2010: 2r | 2011: 2r
(Additional tournaments/rows were returned; omitted here for brevity, but available upon request.)

2) Explicit check whether French Open was 3R in each of the five years 2007–2011
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament,
("2007" ILIKE '%3R%') AS y2007_3r,
("2008" ILIKE '%3R%') AS y2008_3r,
("2009" ILIKE '%3R%') AS y2009_3r,
("2010" ILIKE '%3R%') AS y2010_3r,
("2011" ILIKE '%3R%') AS y2011_3r,
(("2007" ILIKE '%3R%') AND ("2008" ILIKE '%3R%') AND ("2009" ILIKE '%3R%') AND ("2010" ILIKE '%3R%') AND ("2011" ILIKE '%3R%')) AS all_five_consecutive_3r
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE tournament ILIKE '%french%' OR tournament ILIKE '%roland%';
Returned:
- tournament: french open
- y2007_3r: false; y2008_3r: true; y2009_3r: true; y2010_3r: false; y2011_3r: false
- all_five_consecutive_3r: false

Conclusion:
- The data show Olga Govortsova reached the French Open third round in 2008 and 2009 only. She did not reach the third round in 2010 or 2011, and 2007 is not 3R either. Therefore, she did not advance to the third round five years in a row at the French Open.

Assumptions:
- "Third round" corresponds to the result string "3r" in the data.
- "Five years in a row" was interpreted as the five consecutive year columns available in the table (2007–2011), which align with the dataset’s coverage for this player.
