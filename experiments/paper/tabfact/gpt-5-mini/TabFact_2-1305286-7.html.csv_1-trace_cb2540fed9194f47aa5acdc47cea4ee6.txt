Overview of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to ground the verification in the actual database.
- Queried the awards/nominations table for entries related to “Rugrats Go Wild” and for mentions of “Bruce Willis.”
- Confirmed whether Bruce Willis received any nomination tied to that film.

Data source discovered
- postgres_tabfact8 (TabFact) database with one table: public.nickelodeon_movies
  - Columns: year (bigint), category (text), film (text), "winner / nominee (s)" (text), result (text)
  - This table contains awards/nominations records related to Nickelodeon movies.

Executed SQL queries and evidence
1) Exact, case-sensitive match for the film (no rows found)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.nickelodeon_movies WHERE film = 'Rugrats Go Wild';
Result: no rows returned

2) Case-insensitive match for the film (found 1 row)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.nickelodeon_movies WHERE film ILIKE 'Rugrats Go Wild';
Result:
[{"category":"favorite voice from an animated movie","film":"rugrats go wild","result":"nominated","winner / nominee (s)":"bruce willis","year":2004}]

3) Search for "Bruce Willis" in the winner/nominee field (found the same row)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.nickelodeon_movies WHERE "winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%Bruce Willis%';
Result:
[{"category":"favorite voice from an animated movie","film":"rugrats go wild","result":"nominated","winner / nominee (s)":"bruce willis","year":2004}]

Conclusion
- The data shows Bruce Willis was nominated (result = "nominated") in 2004 for “rugrats go wild” in the category “favorite voice from an animated movie.” This supports the claim that he was nominated for the film.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the question as: “Was Bruce Willis nominated for an award for the film Rugrats Go Wild?”
- Used a case-insensitive match for the film title because the table stores it in lowercase. The table context indicates Nickelodeon-related awards; the specific awarding body is not explicitly labeled in the table but the category title aligns with Nickelodeon/Kids’ Choice Awards terminology.
