Claim interpreted: “Detroit tie for the highest home team score.” I evaluate whether, within the available dataset (2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season games), Detroit tied with any other home team for the top home-team goals in a single game.

Step 1 — Inspect data structure and score format
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season LIMIT 10;
- Evidence (sample): scores are in the form "visitor_goals - home_goals". Example rows include:
  1) january 5 | nashville | 0 - 6 | detroit | ...

Step 2 — Find the maximum home-team goals
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX( (regexp_split_to_array(score, '\D+'))[2]::int) AS max_home_goals FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: max_home_goals = 6

Step 3 — List games with that maximum and check if there’s a tie (more than one such game)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record, ((home ILIKE '%detroit%') OR (home ILIKE '%red wings%')) AS detroit_home, (regexp_split_to_array(score, '\D+'))[2]::int AS home_goals
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE (regexp_split_to_array(score, '\D+'))[2]::int = 6
  ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  - january 5 | nashville | 0 - 6 | detroit | ... | detroit_home = true | home_goals = 6

Step 4 — Count how many games achieved the maximum and list distinct home teams
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX((split_part(score, ' - ', 2))::int) AS max_home_goals FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_with_max_home_goals
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE (split_part(score, ' - ', 2))::int = (SELECT MAX((split_part(score, ' - ', 2))::int) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);
  SELECT DISTINCT home
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  WHERE (split_part(score, ' - ', 2))::int = (SELECT MAX((split_part(score, ' - ', 2))::int) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season)
  ORDER BY home;
- Results:
  - max_home_goals = 6
  - games_with_max_home_goals = 1
  - distinct home teams at max = ["detroit"]

Conclusion
- The highest home-team score in this dataset is 6 goals.
- Only one game reached that maximum (Nashville at Detroit, 0–6). Therefore, there is no tie for the highest home-team score; Detroit is the sole holder of the top home-team score in this table.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available dataset: the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season table (all games involving Detroit, both home and away).
- “Home team score” is parsed as the second number in the “score” field formatted as “visitor_goals - home_goals.”
