Claim to verify: “collingwood have a home team score 3.00 point higher than that of carlton.”

Data source explored
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1954_vfl_season (columns: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", "date"). Scores are stored in AFL format “goals.behinds (total)”. Team names are lowercase (e.g., “collingwood”, “carlton”).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect rows for Collingwood and Carlton and extract the total points in parentheses from the home team score
SQL executed:
SELECT "date", "home team", "home team score", substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int AS points
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood','carlton')
ORDER BY "date";
Result:
[ {"date":"14 august 1954","home team":"collingwood","home team score":"12.16 (88)","points":88}, {"date":"14 august 1954","home team":"carlton","home team score":"10.16 (76)","points":76} ]

2) Aggregate per-team home points and count of games
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", SUM(substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int) AS home_points, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood','carlton')
GROUP BY "home team";
Result:
[ {"games":1,"home team":"carlton","home_points":76}, {"games":1,"home team":"collingwood","home_points":88} ]

3) Compute the difference (Collingwood minus Carlton)
SQL executed:
SELECT
SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='collingwood' THEN substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int ELSE 0 END) AS collingwood_points,
SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='carlton' THEN substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int ELSE 0 END) AS carlton_points,
SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='collingwood' THEN substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int ELSE 0 END)
 - SUM(CASE WHEN "home team"='carlton' THEN substring("home team score" from '\\((\\d+)\\)')::int ELSE 0 END) AS diff_coll_minus_carlton
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood','carlton');
Result:
[ {"carlton_points":76,"collingwood_points":88,"diff_coll_minus_carlton":12} ]

Findings
- Collingwood’s home team score (total points) in this dataset: 88.
- Carlton’s home team score (total points) in this dataset: 76.
- Difference (Collingwood − Carlton): 12 points, not 3.00 points.
- The directional part of the claim (“Collingwood have a higher home team score than Carlton”) is supported. The magnitude (“3.00 point”) is contradicted by the data (it is 12 points in this dataset).

Conclusion
- The specific numeric claim is incorrect for the available data; Collingwood’s home team score exceeds Carlton’s by 12 points, not 3.00 points.

Assumptions and scope
- The only available relevant data is the 1954 VFL season table, which (in the rows examined) contains one home game each for Collingwood and Carlton dated 14 August 1954. Verification is therefore scoped to this dataset.
- “Home team score” was interpreted as the total points shown in parentheses in the “home team score” field (e.g., “12.16 (88)” → 88).
