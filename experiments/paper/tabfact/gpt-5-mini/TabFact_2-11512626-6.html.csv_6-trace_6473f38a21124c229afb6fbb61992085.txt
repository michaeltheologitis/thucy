Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact”, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Schema evidence
- Tables found: t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (only table in public schema per schema inspection).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Sample view to understand date formatting
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance
FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season
LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt shows August entries such as:
- august 4 | phillies | 7 - 3 | 15230
- august 5 | phillies | 4 - 2 | 16428
- august 6 | mets     | 4 - 0 | 26633

2) Count games between August 4 and 6 with attendance < 20000
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date IN ('august 4','august 5','august 6') AND attendance < 20000;
Result:
- count: 2

3) List those games (attendance < 20000 on Aug 4–6)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date IN ('august 4','august 5','august 6') AND attendance < 20000 ORDER BY date;
Results:
- august 4 | phillies | 7 - 3 | castillo (8 - 10) | 15230 | 52 - 61
- august 5 | phillies | 4 - 2 | bottalico (2 - 4)  | 16428 | 53 - 61

4) Verify all games on August 4–6 (to show Aug 6 is not < 20000)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date IN ('august 4','august 5','august 6') ORDER BY date;
Results:
- august 4 — phillies — 15230
- august 5 — phillies — 16428
- august 6 — mets     — 26633

Conclusion
- Only 2 games between August 4 and August 6 have attendance < 20,000. The claim of “over 5 times” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “between August 4 and 6th” as inclusive and referring to the 1997 Colorado Rockies season data in t_1997_colorado_rockies_season.
- Dates are stored as text like 'august 4', so exact matches were used for filtering.
