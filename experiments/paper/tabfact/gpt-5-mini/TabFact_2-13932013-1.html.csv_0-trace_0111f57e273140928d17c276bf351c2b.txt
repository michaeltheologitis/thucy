Claim: “Brian Sipe started 7 more games than Bernie Kosar.”

Conclusion: Supported by the available data for Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks.

Data source discovery:
- Database: postgres_tabfact19 (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
- Relevant columns: quarterback, "games started", wins, losses, ties, "winning pct"

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve games started for Brian Sipe and Bernie Kosar
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, "games started", wins, losses
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%sipe%' OR quarterback ILIKE '%kosar%';

Result rows:
- {quarterback: "sipe , brian", "games started": 112, wins: 57, losses: 55}
- {quarterback: "kosar , bernie", "games started": 105, wins: 53, losses: 51}

2) Compute the difference in games started (Brian Sipe minus Bernie Kosar)
SQL executed:
SELECT
  (SELECT "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%sipe%')
  - (SELECT "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%kosar%')
  AS games_started_difference;

Result:
- {games_started_difference: 7}

Assessment:
- According to the Browns starting QBs table, Brian Sipe has 112 games started and Bernie Kosar has 105 games started. The difference is 7, matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted in the context of Cleveland Browns starts (as captured by the table list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks), not total NFL career starts across all teams. Player name matching used case-insensitive contains filters (ILIKE '%sipe%' and ILIKE '%kosar%') to align with the table’s name formatting (e.g., "sipe , brian").
