Data sources explored
- Used data discovery to identify the TabFact database with a table named public.chinese_units_of_measurement.
- Inspected the table schema; it contains a column named "imperial value" alongside "character", "metric value", and others.

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve rows for 厘 and 分
SQL executed:
SELECT character, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value"
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');
Results:
- Character: 厘
  - relative value: 1 / 1600
  - metric value: 37.79931 mg
  - imperial value: ~0.2133 dr
- Character: 分
  - relative value: 1 / 1600
  - metric value: 377.9936375 mg
  - imperial value: ~0.2133 dr

2) Confirm uniqueness of entries per character
SQL executed:
SELECT character, COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement
WHERE character IN ('厘','分')
GROUP BY character
ORDER BY character;
Results:
- character: 分, cnt: 1
- character: 厘, cnt: 1

3) Display full rows to verify exact stored values
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "character" = '厘';
Returned row (relevant fields):
- character: 厘; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "character" = '分';
Returned row (relevant fields):
- character: 分; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr

Assessment
- The "imperial value" for both 厘 and 分 is identical in the authoritative dataset: "~0.2133 dr" for each.
- Therefore, the statement that their imperial values are not equal is contradicted by the data.

Answer: The imperial values for 厘 and 分 are equal in the referenced dataset.

Assumptions
- "dr" in the "imperial value" column denotes the imperial dram.
- The table public.chinese_units_of_measurement is the authoritative source for these conversions in this verification task.
