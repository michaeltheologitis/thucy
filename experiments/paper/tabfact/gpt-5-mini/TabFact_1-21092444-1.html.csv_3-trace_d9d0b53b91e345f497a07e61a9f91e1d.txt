Claim to verify: "the black knight lose to stanford , 67 - 14"

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Tool used: Data source discovery
- Result: One accessible PostgreSQL database named TabFact (postgres_tabfact3), public schema.

Step 2: Explore schema for relevant tables
- Tool used: Schema query
- Result: Found table public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team with columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "black knights points" (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text).

Step 3: Retrieve evidence about Army vs. Stanford
- Question: Did Army (Black Knights) lose to Stanford 67–14?
- Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Stanford%';
- Query result:
  - date: oct 4
  - opponent: stanford
  - result: loss
  - black knights points: 14
  - opponents: 67
  - record: 2 - 2

Assessment of the claim
- The data shows an Army (Black Knights/Cadets) game vs Stanford with a loss by a score of 67–14. This directly matches the claim that the Black Knights lost to Stanford 67–14.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data without discrepancies.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the black knight" as the Army Black Knights (United States Military Academy) football team; the table is for the 1975 Army Cadets season but uses a "black knights points" column, and the nickname variance is treated as immaterial.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a specific game result and score, not requiring season context.
