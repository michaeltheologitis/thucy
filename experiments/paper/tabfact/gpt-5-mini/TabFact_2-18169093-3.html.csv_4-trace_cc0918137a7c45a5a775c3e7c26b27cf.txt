Claim to verify: “In the 1981 Open Championship no 1 player achieved their position alone; in other words, there was a tie at every position.”

Data source discovery
- I discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a relevant table: public.t_1981_open_championship.

Schema inspected
- Table: public.t_1981_open_championship
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text)

Step 1: Inspect how places and ties are represented
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1981_open_championship LIMIT 20;
- Key returned rows (16 total):
  - place=t1 appears multiple times (e.g., vicente fernã¡ndez, nick job)
  - place=t3 appears multiple times (e.g., isao aoki, david graham, tony jacklin, johnny miller, simon owen, hal sutton (a))
  - place=t9 appears multiple times (e.g., howard clark, ben crenshaw, david jagger, mark james, greg norman, arnold palmer, bill rogers, sam torrance)
- Observation: Ties are denoted with a leading “t” (e.g., t1, t3, t9).

Step 2: Count players at each place and check for any unique (single-player) places
- Executed SQL (counts per place):
  SELECT place, COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_1981_open_championship GROUP BY place ORDER BY player_count DESC, place;
- Result:
  - t9: 8 players
  - t3: 6 players
  - t1: 2 players

- Executed SQL (find places with exactly 1 player):
  SELECT t.place, t.player, t.country, t.score, t."to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship t JOIN (SELECT place FROM public.t_1981_open_championship GROUP BY place HAVING COUNT(*) = 1) single ON t.place = single.place ORDER BY t.place;
- Result: No rows returned (there are no places with a single player).

Step 3: Confirm table coverage and distinct place values
- Executed SQL (row count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: total_rows = 16

- Executed SQL (distinct places):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT place) AS distinct_places FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: distinct_places = 3

- Executed SQL (list distinct place values):
  SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place;
- Result: t1, t3, t9

Conclusion based on data
- In the available 1981 Open Championship table, every recorded place (t1, t3, t9) is shared by multiple players. There are no positions occupied by a single player in this dataset.

Assumptions noted
- The table appears to represent a leaderboard snapshot (likely a round leaderboard, given single-round scores like 70, 71, 72 and “to par” such as E, +1, +2), not the final tournament standings.
- “Position” is interpreted as the “place” column values in this table; “tie at every position” means each distinct place has at least two players.
- All conclusions are strictly within the scope of the provided table’s contents.
