Summary
- Claim interpreted: The user asks whether, on a June 16 date, Jeff Gordon was with (i.e., listed as driving for) Hendrick Motorsports.
- Data source explored: TabFact (postgres_tabfact11) database, public schema, table: public.pocono_400.

What the data shows
1) Filtering the Pocono 400 table for entries with date containing “June 16” returns a 1996 record where Jeff Gordon’s team is Hendrick Motorsports.

Executed SQL and results
A) Find all records where the date contains "June 16"
SQL:
SELECT year, date, driver, team, report
FROM public.pocono_400
WHERE date ILIKE '%June 16%';

Results:
- year: 1996; date: june 16; driver: jeff gordon; team: hendrick motorsports; report: report
- year: 1991; date: june 16; driver: darrell waltrip; team: darwal , inc; report: report

B) Verify all occurrences of Jeff Gordon in the table and their teams
SQL (discovery of driver string):
SELECT DISTINCT driver FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE driver ILIKE '%Gordon%';

SQL (final listing for Jeff Gordon):
SELECT year, date, team FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE lower(driver) = 'jeff gordon' ORDER BY year;

Results:
- 1996 — june 16 — hendrick motorsports
- 1997 — june 8 — hendrick motorsports
- 2007 — june 10 — hendrick motorsports
- 2011 — june 12 — hendrick motorsports

Conclusion
- The dataset contains a clear record that on June 16, 1996 (Pocono 400), Jeff Gordon’s listed team was Hendrick Motorsports. This supports the claim that on June 16, Jeff Gordon was on/with Hendrick Motorsports.

Assumptions
- “Be on Hendrick Motorsports” is interpreted as the listed NASCAR team for the driver on that race date.
- No specific year was given; verification is grounded in the available dataset (public.pocono_400), which confirms this for June 16, 1996.
- The conclusion is limited to the scope of the accessible data (Pocono 400 records).
