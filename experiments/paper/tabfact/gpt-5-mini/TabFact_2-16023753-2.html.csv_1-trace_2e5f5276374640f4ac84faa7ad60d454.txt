Summary
- Claim interpreted: The Miami Dolphins’ defense recorded 2 shutouts during the season. Based on the available data source (1983 Miami Dolphins season), we verify whether there were exactly 2 games in which the opponent scored 0 points.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact/postgres_tabfact10 (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Method
- A shutout is defined as a game where the opponent’s score equals 0. The result column encodes scores as text (e.g., "w 12 - 0"). We extracted the opponent’s score (second number) via a regular expression, filtered games where that score equals 0, and counted them.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect the full season rows and the result format
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week;
Observed (relevant excerpts):
- Week 1 — september 4 , 1983 — buffalo bills — w 12 - 0
- Week 12 — november 20 , 1983 — baltimore colts — w 37 - 0

2) List games where opponent scored 0 (shutouts)
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, CAST(regexp_replace(result, '.*?(\\d+)\\D+(\\d+).*', '\\2') AS INTEGER) AS opponent_score
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE CAST(regexp_replace(result, '.*?(\\d+)\\D+(\\d+).*', '\\2') AS INTEGER) = 0
ORDER BY week;
Results:
- Week 1 — september 4 , 1983 — buffalo bills — w 12 - 0 — opponent_score: 0
- Week 12 — november 20 , 1983 — baltimore colts — w 37 - 0 — opponent_score: 0

3) Count the shutouts
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shutout_count
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE CAST(regexp_replace(result, '.*?(\\d+)\\D+(\\d+).*', '\\2') AS INTEGER) = 0;
Result:
- shutout_count: 2

Conclusion
- The available season data (1983 Miami Dolphins) shows exactly 2 shutouts. Therefore, the claim is supported for the 1983 season.

Assumptions
- “Dolphins” refers to the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- “During the season” is interpreted as the 1983 season because that is the only Dolphins season available in the accessible data.
- A “shutout” is defined as the opponent scoring 0 points.
- The result field consistently places the opponent’s score as the second numeric value in the string.
