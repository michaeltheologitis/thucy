Claim to verify:
“the Yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 1:4 in the Balkan Cup against Romania on August 27.”

Data source discovery:
- A live PostgreSQL database (postgres_tabfact12, schema: public) is available. It contains a relevant table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results with columns: date (text), city (text), opponent (text), results (text), type of game (text).

Step 1 — Find Yugoslavia’s Balkan Cup matches and check the August 27 result vs Romania
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan Cup%' LIMIT 50;

Returned rows:
- {date: "march 30", city: "belgrade", opponent: "romania", results: "2:0", type: "balkan cup"}
- {date: "august 27", city: "bucharest , romania", opponent: "romania", results: "1:4", type: "balkan cup"}

Finding: There is a Balkan Cup match on “august 27” versus Romania, result “1:4,” matching the claim. The city is recorded as “bucharest , romania.”

Step 2 — Determine whether this is the worst Balkan Cup outcome (by goal difference)
Executed SQL:
WITH b AS (
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" AS type,
    (regexp_replace(results, '^.*?([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+).*$','\1'))::int AS gf,
    (regexp_replace(results, '^.*?([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+).*$','\2'))::int AS ga
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan Cup%'
)
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, type, gf, ga, (gf - ga) AS gd
FROM b
ORDER BY gd ASC;

Returned rows (ordered by worst goal difference first):
- {date: "august 27", city: "bucharest , romania", opponent: "romania", results: "1:4", type: "balkan cup", gf: 1, ga: 4, gd: -3}
- {date: "march 30", city: "belgrade", opponent: "romania", results: "2:0", type: "balkan cup", gf: 2, ga: 0, gd: 2}

Finding: Among Balkan Cup matches in this dataset, the 1:4 loss on August 27 is the worst outcome by goal difference (−3).

Step 3 — (Cross-check) Is this also the worst outcome overall in the dataset?
Executed SQL (sample results inspection):
SELECT results FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results LIMIT 30;

Executed SQL (find minimum goal difference row):
SELECT date, opponent, results, "type of game", ((regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\2'))::int) AS gd
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results ~ '(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+)'
ORDER BY gd ASC
LIMIT 1;

Returned row:
{ "date": "august 27", "opponent": "romania", "results": "1:4", "type of game": "balkan cup", "gd": -3 }

Executed SQL (confirm min goal difference value):
SELECT MIN( (regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\2'))::int) AS min_gd
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results ~ '(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+)';

Returned row:
{ "min_gd": -3 }

Executed SQL (list all matches with that worst goal difference):
SELECT date, opponent, results, "type of game", ((regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\2'))::int) AS gd
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE results ~ '(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+)'
AND ((regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\1'))::int - (regexp_replace(results, '.*?(\d+)\s*[:\-]\s*(\d+).*', '\2'))::int) = -3
ORDER BY date;

Returned rows:
{ "date": "august 27", "opponent": "romania", "results": "1:4", "type of game": "balkan cup", "gd": -3 }

Finding: Within this dataset, the 1:4 loss on August 27 is also the worst overall defeat recorded (goal difference −3). This corroborates the “worst outcome” phrasing in the Balkan Cup context and, in this dataset, overall.

Conclusion:
- The data show that Yugoslavia lost 1:4 to Romania in the Balkan Cup on August 27, and this is the worst Balkan Cup result by goal difference in the dataset. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- “Worst outcome” is interpreted as worst goal difference (largest-margin loss); the data support this within Balkan Cup matches.
- The results column is parsed as Yugoslavia goals first, opponent goals second (format like “X:Y”).
- The date is stored without a year (e.g., “august 27”); the claim likewise does not specify a year.
