Summary
- Claim interpreted: “Globular clusters have more apparent magnitude than irregular galaxies.” Interpreting “more apparent magnitude” as a larger (numerically higher) apparent magnitude value on the standard astronomical magnitude scale (where larger numbers are fainter).
- Result from available data: In the accessible NGC 5001–6000 subset, the single globular cluster is brighter (lower magnitude) than the irregular galaxies, which have higher (fainter) magnitudes. Thus, the claim is not supported by the data at hand.

Data source discovery
- Tool reported one accessible PostgreSQL source (TabFact/postgres_tabfact20) with a public schema containing at least one table.

Schema inspected
- Database: postgres_tabfact20 (TabFact)
- Table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  - Columns: ngc number (bigint), object type (text), constellation (text), right ascension ( j2000 ) (text), declination ( j2000 ) (text), apparent magnitude (double precision)

Evidence
1) Distinct object types and counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY row_count DESC;
Result:
- irregular galaxy: 2
- spiral galaxy: 2
- globular cluster: 1

2) Objects and magnitudes for the relevant types
SQL executed:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude" 
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" IN ('globular cluster','irregular galaxy')
ORDER BY "ngc number";
Result:
- 5408 — irregular galaxy — 14
- 5466 — globular cluster — 10.5
- 5477 — irregular galaxy — 14.5

3) Summary statistics by type
SQL executed:
SELECT lower("object type") AS object_type, COUNT("apparent magnitude") AS cnt_with_mag, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_mag, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_mag, MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_mag
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE lower("object type") IN ('globular cluster','irregular galaxy')
GROUP BY lower("object type")
ORDER BY object_type;
Result:
- globular cluster: count=1, avg=10.5, min=10.5, max=10.5
- irregular galaxy: count=2, avg=14.25, min=14.0, max=14.5

Interpretation
- On the apparent magnitude scale, a larger value means fainter. In the available data, irregular galaxies have higher (fainter) magnitudes on average (14.25) than the lone globular cluster (10.5). Therefore, globular clusters do not have “more” (i.e., higher) apparent magnitude than irregular galaxies here; the reverse is observed.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available dataset (NGC 5001–6000 subset). Within this data, irregular galaxies have higher (fainter) apparent magnitudes than the globular cluster.

Assumptions
- “More apparent magnitude” is interpreted as a larger numerical magnitude on the standard astronomical scale.
- Verification is constrained to the accessible table covering NGC objects 5001–6000, treated as authoritative within its scope per instructions.
