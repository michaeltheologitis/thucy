Claim assessed: "mehgaon have the highest number of electorate in 2009"

Data source consulted: TabFact database (public schema), table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency with columns ["constituency number" (text), "name" (text), "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" (text), "district" (text), "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)].

What I checked:
- Identified if any aggregate “total” row exists and then ranked all constituencies by their 2009 electorate count (excluding the aggregate row).
- Verified the maximum value and which constituency holds it.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Initial sort to inspect contents (revealed an aggregate total row at the top):
SQL executed:
SELECT "constituency number", "name", "number of electorates (2009)"
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC;
Observation from returned rows (top rows):
- constituency number: "total :", name: "total :", number of electorates (2009): 1371252
- constituency number: "12", name: "mehgaon", number of electorates (2009): 210649

2) List constituencies excluding the aggregate total row, sorted by electorate count (2009):
SQL executed:
SELECT "constituency number", "name", "number of electorates (2009)"
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE "constituency number" <> 'total :'
ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC;
Returned (highest → lowest):
1. 12 — mehgaon — 210649
2. 11 — lahar — 205839
3. 10 — bhind — 197183
4. 9 — ater — 177334
5. 13 — gohad — 166893
6. 22 — datia — 143593
7. 21 — bhander — 139600
8. 20 — sewda — 130161

3) Compute the maximum electorate count (excluding total rows) and identify which constituency(ies) have that maximum:
SQL executed (max value):
SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") AS max_electorates
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE lower("name") NOT LIKE '%total%';
Result: {"max_electorates": 210649}

SQL executed (who has that max):
SELECT "constituency number", "name", "number of electorates (2009)"
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE "number of electorates (2009)" = 210649
  AND lower("name") NOT LIKE '%total%';
Result: {"constituency number": "12", "name": "mehgaon", "number of electorates (2009)": 210649}

Conclusion:
- Among the constituencies listed in this table (excluding the aggregate total row), Mehgaon has the highest number of electorates in 2009: 210,649. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Scope interpreted as “among the constituencies in the public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table.”
- The aggregate row labeled "total :" is excluded when determining the highest constituency value.
