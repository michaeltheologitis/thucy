Claim interpreted: The user asks whether the entry “coherence” has “partial” support for Windows (i.e., Windows OS support status is “partial”).

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing the table public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers.
- This table includes OS support fields for various UPnP AV media servers.

Targeted evidence:
1) Query to list the specific row for “coherence” and its OS support fields:
SQL:
SELECT name, license, "os x", "unix - like", windows, "web interface"
FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers
WHERE lower(name) = 'coherence';
Result:
- name: coherence
- license: mit
- os x: partial
- unix - like: partial
- windows: partial
- web interface: yes

2) (Context) Query used to inspect all rows in the table:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers;
Observation from the result set: the row for “coherence” shows windows = "partial" along with partial support for other OS fields.

Conclusion:
- The data explicitly shows that for the product named “coherence,” the Windows support field is “partial.” Therefore, the claim that “coherence have partial window(s)” is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “window” is interpreted as “Windows OS.”
- “coherence” refers to the product row named “coherence” in public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers.
- Case-insensitive match was used to retrieve the row (lower(name) = 'coherence').
