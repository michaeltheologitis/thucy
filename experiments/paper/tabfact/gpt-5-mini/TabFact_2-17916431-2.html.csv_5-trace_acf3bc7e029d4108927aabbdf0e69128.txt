Claim to verify:
- "March be featured more often as a month in the date than any other month, followed by the 4 game in April."

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact (postgres_tabfact18)
- Table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Step 1 — Inspect sample data to understand date format
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  ORDER BY game
  LIMIT 15;
- Evidence (excerpt): dates are stored as text in the form "9 august 2008", "1 november 2008", etc. (day month year, month as a spelled-out word).

Step 2 — Count matches by month (to test whether March is the most frequent and to see April’s count)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT to_char(d, 'FMMonth') AS month_name,
         EXTRACT(MONTH FROM d)::int AS month_num,
         count(*) AS match_count
  FROM (
    SELECT to_date("date", 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') AS d
    FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  ) sub
  GROUP BY month_name, month_num
  ORDER BY match_count DESC, month_num;
- Results:
  - March — 7 matches (highest)
  - October — 6
  - January — 5
  - February — 5
  - December — 5
  - August — 4
  - September — 4
  - November — 4
  - April — 3

Step 3 — Verify April’s exact matches
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%April%'
  ORDER BY to_date(regexp_replace(date, '.*?([0-9]{1,2} [A-Za-z]+ [0-9]{4}).*', '\1'), 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY');
- Results:
  - Game 41: 4 April 2009
  - Game 42: 10 April 2009
  - Game 43: 13 April 2009
  - April total = 3 matches

Step 4 — Sanity check total counts
- SQL executed (total rows):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season;
- Result: 43
- SQL executed (per year-month):
  SELECT to_char(to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'),'YYYY-MM') AS year_month, COUNT(*) AS matches
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  GROUP BY year_month
  ORDER BY year_month;
- Result rows:
  2008-08: 4, 2008-09: 4, 2008-10: 6, 2008-11: 4, 2008-12: 5, 2009-01: 5, 2009-02: 5, 2009-03: 7, 2009-04: 3
- SQL executed (sum over monthly aggregation):
  SELECT SUM(matches) AS sum_monthly_counts FROM (
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches
    FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
    GROUP BY to_char(to_date(date,'FMDD FMMonth YYYY'),'YYYY-MM')
  ) t;
- Result: 43 (matches total rows)

Findings:
- March is indeed the most frequent month in the table’s date column with 7 matches.
- April has 3 matches, not 4, and is not the second-most frequent month. October (6) and several other months (5) are higher than April.

Conclusion:
- The first part of the claim is supported by the data: March is the most frequent month.
- The second part is incorrect: April does not have 4 games; it has 3, and it is not next after March in frequency.

Assumptions about the claim’s intent:
- Interpreted "be feature more often as a month in the date" as referring to the frequency of month values in the table’s date column.
- Interpreted "follow by the 4 game in april" as asserting that April has 4 matches and is next after March in frequency, within this single dataset (Bradford City A.F.C. 2008–09 season).
