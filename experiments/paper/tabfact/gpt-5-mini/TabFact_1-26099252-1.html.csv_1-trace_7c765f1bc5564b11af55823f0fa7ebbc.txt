Claim to verify:
- "the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named public.html5_video. Columns include: browser, operating system, latest stable release, theora, h264, vp8 ( webm ), vp9 ( webm ). This table tracks per-browser codec information by operating system.

Evidence query 1 (find Android-related rows):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", theora, h264
FROM public.html5_video
WHERE browser ILIKE '%Android%' OR "operating system" ILIKE '%Android%';
- Result:
  - browser: android browser
  - operating system: android
  - latest stable release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )
  - theora: 2.3
  - h264: 3.0

Evidence query 2 (exact match for Android Browser on Android):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", theora, h264
FROM public.html5_video
WHERE browser = 'android browser' AND "operating system" = 'android';
- Result:
  - browser: android browser
  - operating system: android
  - latest stable release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012 )
  - theora: 2.3
  - h264: 3.0

Conclusion:
- The public.html5_video table contains a single row for the Android Browser on Android that lists theora = 2.3 and h264 = 3.0. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- "the android browser for android" refers to the row where browser = "android browser" and operating system = "android" in the public.html5_video table.
- The theora and h264 columns represent version numbers as recorded in this dataset, matching the numeric values observed.
