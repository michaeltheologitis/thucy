Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table used: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup (columns: "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date")

Method:
- Searched for matches where the away team name contains "bolton wanderer" (case-insensitive) and inspected the recorded score.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%bolton wanderer%';

Result:
- tie no: 11 | home team: manchester united | score: 1 - 0 | away team: bolton wanderers | date: 26 / 01 / 1991

Assessment:
- The only match in this dataset with away team Bolton Wanderers shows a score of "1 - 0". This supports the claim that the score was 1 - 0 when the away team was Bolton Wanderers.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "bolton wanderer" as a reference to the club "Bolton Wanderers" and matched case-insensitively using a substring search.
- Verification is within the scope of the 1990–91 FA Cup table available in the TabFact database.
