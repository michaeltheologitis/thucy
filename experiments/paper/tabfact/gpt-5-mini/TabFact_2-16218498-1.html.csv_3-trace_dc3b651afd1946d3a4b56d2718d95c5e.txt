Claim: “Botswana Defence Force XI have a lower agg than Arsenal (Maseru).”

How I interpreted the claim
- “agg” refers to the aggregate score column (“agg”) in the table t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs, which records two-legged tie aggregates as text like “4 - 0”.
- I compare the first number in the “agg” (the aggregate goals of the team listed as “team 1”).

Data source and schema context
- Data source discovered: TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  - Columns: “team 1” (text), “agg” (text), “team 2” (text), “1st leg” (text), “2nd leg” (text)
  - There is an “agg” column in this table.

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Find Arsenal (Maseru) rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1","team 2","agg","1st leg","2nd leg" 
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE lower("team 1") LIKE '%arsenal%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%arsenal%'
   OR lower("team 1") LIKE '%maseru%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%maseru%'
   OR lower("team 1") LIKE '%lesotho%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%lesotho%';
Result:
- team 1: arsenal (maseru) | team 2: eleven arrows fc | agg: 4 - 0 | 1st leg: 3 - 0 | 2nd leg: 1 - 0

2) Find Botswana Defence Force XI rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1","team 2","agg","1st leg","2nd leg" 
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE lower("team 1") LIKE '%bdf%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%bdf%'
   OR lower("team 1") LIKE '%defence force%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%defence force%'
   OR lower("team 1") LIKE '%defense force%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%defense force%'
   OR lower("team 1") LIKE '%botswana%'
   OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%botswana%';
Result:
- team 1: botswana defence force xi | team 2: mbabane highlanders | agg: 1 - 2 | 1st leg: 1 - 1 | 2nd leg: 0 - 1

3) Check if either team appears as team 2 (to avoid perspective issues)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE "team 2" IN ('Arsenal (Maseru)', 'Botswana Defence Force XI');
Result: cnt = 0 (neither appears as team 2 in this table)

4) Extract numeric team-1 aggregate goals and compare
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", agg, substring(agg from '([0-9]+)')::int AS team1_agg_goals 
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
WHERE lower("team 1") IN ('arsenal (maseru)','botswana defence force xi')
ORDER BY "team 1";
Results:
- arsenal (maseru) | eleven arrows fc | agg: 4 - 0 | team1_agg_goals: 4
- botswana defence force xi | mbabane highlanders | agg: 1 - 2 | team1_agg_goals: 1

Conclusion
- Arsenal (Maseru) has an aggregate of 4 (as team 1), while Botswana Defence Force XI has an aggregate of 1 (as team 1) in their respective ties in this dataset. Therefore, Botswana Defence Force XI have a lower agg than Arsenal (Maseru).

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated within the available dataset (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs table) because it is the only accessible source containing these teams.
- “Lower agg” means the first number of the “agg” field (aggregate goals for the team listed as “team 1”). Both teams appear only as “team 1” in this table, so no side-switching adjustment was needed.
