Claim to verify: "the jazz have a houston graduate from turkey play for them from 2005 - 06"

Summary of findings:
- The data shows one Turkish player on the Utah Jazz roster in that era: Mehmet Okur (nationality: Turkey), whose Jazz tenure spans 2004–11. His listed school/club is Efes Pilsen (Turkey), not University of Houston.
- The data also shows one Utah Jazz player whose school is Houston (University of Houston): Andre Owens, who played for the Jazz in 2005–06, but his nationality is United States, not Turkey.
- A direct check for any Utah Jazz player who is both Turkish and from Houston returns zero matches.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL:
1) List all Utah Jazz roster entries with nationality = Turkey
SQL executed:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE nationality ILIKE 'Turkey';
Result:
- player: mehmet okur | nationality: turkey | years for jazz: 2004 - 11 | school / club team: efes pilsen ( turkey )

2) Find all Utah Jazz players whose school/club contains "Houston"
SQL executed:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%houston%';
Result:
- player: andre owens | nationality: united states | years for jazz: 2005 - 06 | school / club team: houston

3) Verify if any player satisfies both: nationality = Turkey AND school contains Houston
SQL executed (set of checks):
- Distinct nationalities present:
  SELECT DISTINCT nationality FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster;
  Result: turkey; united states; puerto rico
- Turkish players:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team"
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE nationality = 'turkey';
  Result: mehmet okur | turkey | 2004 - 11 | efes pilsen ( turkey )
- Players with Houston as school/club:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team"
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%houston%';
  Result: andre owens | united states | 2005 - 06 | houston
- Count of players matching both conditions:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE nationality = 'turkey' AND "school / club team" ILIKE '%houston%';
  Result: match_count = 0

Conclusion:
- No Utah Jazz player in the dataset is both from Turkey and a University of Houston alum in 2005–06 (or any year). The claim conflates two separate players who were on the Jazz in that timeframe: Mehmet Okur (from Turkey) and Andre Owens (from University of Houston).

Assumptions made:
- "Houston graduate" refers to University of Houston alumni, as captured by the "school / club team" field containing "Houston".
- "from 2005 - 06" refers to the 2005–06 NBA season as represented in the "years for jazz" text field.
- "from Turkey" maps to nationality = 'turkey' in the table.
