Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota played at home 2 fewer times than they played away.

Data source discovery
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a relevant table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season.
- This table contains game-level rows for the Minnesota Wild 2007–08 season with columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record.

Evidence and SQL queries
1) Total games present in the table (context check)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
Result:
- total_games: 14

2) Identify team name format for accurate filtering (visitor column)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT visitor FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY visitor;
Results (visitor values include):
- calgary, dallas, detroit, minnesota, nashville, ny islanders, vancouver

3) Identify team name format (home column)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY home;
Results (home values include):
- chicago, columbus, edmonton, florida, minnesota, st louis, tampa bay, vancouver, washington

4) Count home vs. away games for Minnesota and compute difference (away − home)
SQL:
SELECT
  SUM(CASE WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_games,
  SUM(CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS away_games,
  SUM(CASE WHEN visitor = 'minnesota' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)
  - SUM(CASE WHEN home = 'minnesota' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS away_minus_home
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
Result:
- home_games: 6
- away_games: 8
- away_minus_home: 2

Conclusion
- In this dataset, Minnesota played 6 home games and 8 away games, meaning they played at home exactly 2 fewer times than away. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: home_games = away_games − 2.
- Assumed the table public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season fully represents the season context for the purpose of verification and that the team is labeled as 'minnesota' (lowercase) in the data.
