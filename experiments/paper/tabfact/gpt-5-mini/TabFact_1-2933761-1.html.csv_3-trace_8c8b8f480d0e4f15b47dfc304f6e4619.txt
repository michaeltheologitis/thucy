Claim: “Quentin is the only person to be a police officer in the Cube.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact (schema: public). It contains a table relevant to the Cube film: cube_film_series.

Schema summary (public.cube_film_series):
- Columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text)

Evidence gathered
1) Full table scan to view character occupations
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, occupation, gender, "prison connection", "played by", status FROM cube_film_series ORDER BY name;
Observed relevant rows:
- quentin — occupation: police officer
- All other listed characters (david worth, dr helen holloway, joan leaven, kazan, rennes) have different occupations (architect, free clinic doctor, mathematics student, autistic savant, prison escapist).

2) Exact match check for “police officer”
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_police_officer FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation = 'police officer';
Result: count_police_officer = 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT name FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation = 'police officer' ORDER BY name;
Result: quentin

3) Case-insensitive substring check for any “police” occupation variants
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, occupation, gender, "prison connection", "played by", status FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%';
Result row(s): quentin — police officer

Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS police_count FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%';
Result: police_count = 1

Conclusion
- All queries consistently show that only Quentin has the occupation “police officer” among the characters listed in the cube_film_series table. This supports the claim that Quentin is the only police officer in the Cube ensemble captured by this dataset.

Assumptions
- “In the cube” refers to the characters represented in the Cube (1997) film as modeled by the cube_film_series table.
- Occupation values in this table comprehensively represent each character’s role; no characters are missing from this dataset for the scope of the claim.
- Variants like capitalization or hyphenation were checked via a case-insensitive substring search; none besides Quentin were found.
