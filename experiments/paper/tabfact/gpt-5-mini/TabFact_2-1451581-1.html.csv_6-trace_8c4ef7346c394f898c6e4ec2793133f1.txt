Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (trusted per instructions)
- Table: public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic (columns: rank, airport, code (iata / icao), total cargo (metric tonnes), % change)

2) Row for Memphis International Airport
Executed SQL:
SELECT "rank", airport, "code (iata / icao)", "total cargo (metric tonnes)" 
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Memphis%';
Result:
- rank: 2 | airport: memphis international airport | code: mem / kmem | total cargo (metric tonnes): 3916535

3) Busiest airport (rank = 1) for comparison
Executed SQL:
SELECT "rank", airport, "code (iata / icao)", "total cargo (metric tonnes)" 
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE "rank" = 1;
Result:
- rank: 1 | airport: hong kong international airport | code: hkg / vhhh | total cargo (metric tonnes): 4062261

Assessment
- The table ranks Hong Kong International Airport as #1 by cargo traffic and Memphis International Airport as #2. Therefore, Memphis does not have “the most” cargo traffic globally in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the available source.

Assumptions and notes
- “Most cargo in and out” was interpreted as the busiest airport by total cargo traffic (metric tonnes) worldwide. The table does not specify the year; conclusions are limited to the dataset provided. “Cargo ship” was understood to mean cargo air traffic at airports, not maritime shipping.
