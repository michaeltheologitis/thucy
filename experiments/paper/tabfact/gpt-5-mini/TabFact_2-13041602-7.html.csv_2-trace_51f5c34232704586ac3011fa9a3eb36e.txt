Claim to verify: “there be 4 game in the 2005 milwaukee brewer season where 1 team score no point.”
Interpretation: Count games in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season where either team scored 0 runs (shutouts).

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Tool result: One accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact). No other sources available in this session.

Step 2 — Identify relevant tables and schema
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Result: Found table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season with columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). No other Brewers/MLB 2005 tables were found.

Executed SQL (schema discovery shown by the tool):
- The schema tool listed the table and its columns as above; no SQL text returned for this step.

Step 3 — Inspect sample rows to understand score format
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
ORDER BY date
LIMIT 15;

Sample results (abbrev.):
1) september 1 | padres | 5 - 6 | …
8) september 17 | astros | 0 - 7 | …
13) september 22 | cubs | 0 - 3 | …
…
- Observed: score formatted as “A - B”, where A appears to be Brewers runs and B opponent runs. Extras like “(12)” denote extra innings.

Step 4 — Compute total rows (games) in this table and shutout count
Executed SQL (aggregate check using split_part + regexp_replace):
SELECT
  count(*) AS total_games,
  sum(CASE WHEN (NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int = 0 OR NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 2)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int = 0) THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS shutout_games
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;

Result:
- total_games: 27
- shutout_games: 4

Step 5 — List the shutout games found in this table
Executed SQL (list with parsed runs):
SELECT date, opponent, score,
  NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS runs_for,
  NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 2)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS runs_against
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE (NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 1)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int = 0 OR NULLIF(regexp_replace(trim(split_part(score, '-', 2)), '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int = 0)
ORDER BY date;

Returned rows (shutouts in this table):
- september 17 — astros — 0 - 7 (Brewers shut out)
- september 22 — cubs — 0 - 3 (Brewers shut out)
- september 25 — cardinals — 0 - 2 (Brewers shut out)
- september 29 — reds — 2 - 0 (Opponent shut out)

Cross-check (alternative regex-only parsing)
Executed SQL (count via capturing groups):
SELECT count(*) AS shutout_count
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE ((regexp_replace(score, '^\s*([0-9]+)\s*-\s*([0-9]+).*$','\1'))::int = 0
       OR (regexp_replace(score, '^\s*([0-9]+)\s*-\s*([0-9]+).*$','\2'))::int = 0);

Result: shutout_count = 4

Findings and limitations
- The only available table contains 27 games, all dated in September, not the full 2005 season (which should be 162 games). Within this limited subset, there are 4 shutouts.
- Because the dataset does not cover the entire season, it is insufficient to verify the claim for the whole 2005 season. The evidence supports “4 shutouts in September 2005” for the Brewers’ schedule in this table, but not the whole season.

Conclusion
- The claim about the entire 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season having 4 games where one team scored 0 runs is not verifiable with the available data. The accessible data only confirms 4 such games within the 27 September games captured in the table.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “score no point” as “score 0 runs (shutout).”
- Assumed the first integer in score is Brewers’ runs and the second is opponents’ runs.
- Treated the public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season table as accurate within its scope but limited to September based on the date values observed.
