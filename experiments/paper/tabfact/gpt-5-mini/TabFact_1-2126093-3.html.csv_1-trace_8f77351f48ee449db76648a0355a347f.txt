Claim to verify: "the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be 203"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database for TabFact (public schema).
- Relevant table identified: public.ai_miyazato with columns including tournament and winning score.

Evidence from data:
1) Query to locate the Vernal Ladies tournament and its winning score
Executed SQL:
SELECT tournament, "winning score" FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE lower(tournament) LIKE '%vernal%';
Result:
- tournament: vernal ladies
- winning score: 69 + 64 + 70 = 203

Assessment:
- The stored winning score string explicitly equals 203. This directly supports the claim that the winning score for the Vernal Ladies tournament is 203.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "win score" is interpreted as the "winning score" field in the dataset.
- "vernal ladies tournament" refers to the row with tournament = "vernal ladies" in the ai_miyazato table.
