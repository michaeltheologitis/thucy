Claim: "only 1 of the viral disease be in baltimore group iii"

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.viral_disease
- Relevant column: "baltimore group" (text)

Evidence:
1) Group-wise counts of records by Baltimore group
Executed SQL:
SELECT "baltimore group", count(*) AS cnt
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "baltimore group"
ORDER BY cnt DESC NULLS LAST;
Result:
- group v -> 7
- group iv -> 7
- group i -> 5
- group iii -> 1
- group vi -> 1
- group vii -> 1
- group ii -> 1

2) Direct count for Baltimore Group III (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE lower("baltimore group") = lower('group iii');
Result:
- count = 1

Conclusion: The dataset shows exactly 1 record in Baltimore Group III. This supports the claim that only one viral disease entry is in Baltimore Group III in the provided table.

Assumptions:
- "viral disease" refers to rows in the table public.viral_disease within the TabFact database.
- "Baltimore Group III" corresponds to the stored value 'group iii' in the "baltimore group" column.
