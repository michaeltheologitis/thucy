- Schema: public
- Table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf

Schema overview (relevant columns)
- player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence collected
1) Understand formatting of the "to par" column
Executed SQL:
SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY "to par"
ORDER BY count DESC, "to par" NULLS LAST;
Result summary:
- + 3 -> 4 rows
- - 1 -> 3 rows
- + 1 -> 2 rows
- - 2 -> 1 row
- + 2 -> 1 row
- e -> 1 row
Interpretation: Values beginning with a minus sign represent under-par scores.

2) List under-par finishers ("to par" negative)
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" ~ '^\s*-' ORDER BY country, player;
Rows returned (4 total under-par finishers):
- place: t2, player: chip beck, country: united states, score: 71 + 69 + 71 + 68 = 279, to par: - 1, money: 67823
- place: 1, player: curtis strange, country: united states, score: 71 + 64 + 73 + 70 = 278, to par: - 2, money: 200000
- place: t2, player: mark mccumber, country: united states, score: 70 + 68 + 72 + 69 = 279, to par: - 1, money: 67823
- place: t2, player: ian woosnam, country: wales, score: 70 + 68 + 73 + 68 = 279, to par: - 1, money: 67823

3) Count under-par finishers by country
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS under_par_count FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" ~ '^\s*-' GROUP BY country ORDER BY under_par_count DESC, country;
Result:
- united states: 3
- wales: 1

4) Total number of under-par finishers
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_under_par FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" ~ '^\s*-';
Result:
- total_under_par: 4

Analysis
- Under-par finishers: 4 total
- From the United States: 3 of 4 (75%)
Conclusion: A majority of the people who scored under par in this dataset are from the United States.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope is limited to the available dataset (1989 U.S. Open Golf) in table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf.
- “Under par” was operationalized as rows where the "to par" text begins with a minus sign (regex '^\s*-').
- Country names were taken as-is from the country column (lowercased in this table).
