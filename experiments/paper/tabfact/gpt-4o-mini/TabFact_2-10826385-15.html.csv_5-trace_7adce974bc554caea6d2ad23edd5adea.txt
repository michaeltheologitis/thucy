Claim: “melbourne have the second lowest score when playing as the away team.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered dataset: a PostgreSQL database with a single table t_1972_vfl_season. This table contains 6 matches, all on 15 July 1972, with columns for home/away teams and scores in AFL format (e.g., “8.10 (58)”).

Step 1: Confirm table scope (rows and dates)
- Evidence: Row count and distinct dates
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_1972_vfl_season;
SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS count_per_date FROM t_1972_vfl_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
Result:
- total_rows = 6
- date = 15 July 1972, count = 6
Interpretation: The table covers 6 matches (one round) on 15 July 1972.

Step 2: Extract and rank away-team scores for those matches
- Evidence: List away teams with their scores and extracted total points (number in parentheses)
SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)')::int AS total_points 
FROM t_1972_vfl_season 
ORDER BY total_points ASC;
Results (lowest to highest):
1) melbourne — 8.10 (58) — 58
2) south melbourne — 8.15 (63) — 63
3) st kilda — 9.11 (65) — 65
4) north melbourne — 9.12 (66) — 66
5) geelong — 15.8 (98) — 98
6) richmond — 17.9 (111) — 111
Interpretation: In this dataset, Melbourne’s away score (58) is the lowest, not the second lowest.

Step 3: Verify via per-team away average (for completeness; here each team appears once away)
- Evidence: Average away points per team, ranked ascending
SQL:
SELECT "away team" AS away_team, COUNT(*) AS games, ROUND(AVG(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)')::int), 1) AS average_away_points
FROM t_1972_vfl_season
GROUP BY "away team"
ORDER BY average_away_points ASC;
Results (lowest to highest averages):
- melbourne: games=1, average=58.0 (rank 1)
- south melbourne: games=1, average=63.0 (rank 2)
- st kilda: games=1, average=65.0 (rank 3)
- north melbourne: games=1, average=66.0 (rank 4)
- geelong: games=1, average=98.0 (rank 5)
- richmond: games=1, average=111.0 (rank 6)
Interpretation: This corroborates that Melbourne ranks lowest, not second lowest, in away points for the matches present.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data (six matches on 15 July 1972), Melbourne has the lowest away score, not the second lowest. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The verification is performed strictly within the scope of the available dataset (t_1972_vfl_season), which contains only 6 matches on 15 July 1972. If the intent was to assess a different time span (e.g., full 1972 season or multiple seasons), that data is not present here; conclusions are thus limited to the matches in this table.
