Claim to verify: “the jazz have 2 player with the last name dawkins but their time on the team do not overlap.”

Summary conclusion: The database shows exactly two Utah Jazz players with the last name “Dawkins” — Darryl Dawkins (1987–88) and Paul Dawkins (1979–80). These seasons do not overlap. The claim is supported by the data.

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all Jazz players whose name contains “Dawkins”
SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';

Result:
- Darryl Dawkins | 1987 - 88
- Paul Dawkins   | 1979 - 80

2) Count distinct players with last name “Dawkins”
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_players 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';

Result:
- distinct_players: 2

Assessment of overlap:
- Paul Dawkins: 1979–80
- Darryl Dawkins: 1987–88
- These seasons are separated by multiple years; therefore, their time on the team does not overlap.

Assumptions:
- “Jazz” refers to the NBA franchise’s all-time roster as represented in the Utah Jazz all-time roster table, which covers the franchise history (including the early Utah years). 
- “Time on the team” is interpreted from the “years for jazz” field in the roster table.
