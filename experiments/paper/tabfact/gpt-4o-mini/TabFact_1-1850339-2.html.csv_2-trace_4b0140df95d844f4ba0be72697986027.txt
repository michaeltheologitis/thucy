Summary of findings
- I explored the available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database focused on the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy, containing Army–Navy–Air Force game information.
- The schema shows a table with a field labeled “army - navy score,” which in the 2016 row encodes the scheduled date and location for the Army–Navy game.
- Querying the 2016 season row confirms the Army–Navy game was scheduled for 10 Dec 2016 in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium).

Data source discovery
- Available database: commander_in_chief_s_trophy
- Primary table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy

Schema details (from schema inspection)
- Table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy
  - season (bigint)
  - trophy winner (text)
  - air force - navy score (text)
  - air force - army score (text)
  - army - navy score (text)

Executed SQL and results
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 2016;

- Result (key fields):
  - season: 2016
  - trophy winner: TBD
  - air force - navy score: TBD
  - air force - army score: TBD
  - army - navy score: 10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium)

Conclusion
- The data explicitly states “10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium)” for the Army–Navy game entry in the 2016 season. Therefore, the claim that an Army–Navy game will be played on 10 Dec 2016 at Baltimore, MD is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Army - Navy game” refers to the annual Army–Navy college football game.
- The “army - navy score” field in this dataset is used to store the scheduled date and location (and not only the score) for 2016, as indicated by the returned value.
