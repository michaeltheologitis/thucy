Claim interpreted: “The smallest attendance was not at the game against the New England Patriots but against the Baltimore Colts.” We verify this against the available data source for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season.

Data source context
- Discovered database: a PostgreSQL source with a single table t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (1976 Buffalo Bills NFL season). Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence 1: Minimum attendance game (overall)
- Result:
  - Week: 11
  - Date: November 21, 1976
  - Opponent: San Diego Chargers
  - Result: L 34 - 13
  - Attendance: 36,539
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance 
  FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season 
  WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season);

Evidence 2: Distinct opponents present in the dataset
- Result includes both “Baltimore Colts” and “New England Patriots” among others.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season ORDER BY opponent;

Evidence 3: Minimum attendance by opponent
- Results (subset relevant to claim):
  - New England Patriots: 45,144
  - Baltimore Colts: 50,451
  - Overall minimum: San Diego Chargers: 36,539
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent, MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance 
  FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season 
  GROUP BY opponent 
  ORDER BY opponent;

Evidence 4: All games ordered by attendance (to show complete ordering around Patriots vs Colts)
- Ordered by attendance ascending (excerpt around the claim):
  - …
  - Week 7, 1976-10-24, New England Patriots — 45,144
  - Week 14, 1976-12-12, Baltimore Colts — 50,451
  - …
  (Full ordered list retrieved shows the smallest attendance overall was 36,539 vs San Diego Chargers.)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance, result 
  FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season 
  ORDER BY attendance ASC;

Conclusion
- The smallest attendance for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season was against the San Diego Chargers (36,539), not against the Baltimore Colts. 
- Comparing only the two opponents in the claim, the New England Patriots game had lower attendance (45,144) than the Baltimore Colts (50,451). 
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “New England Patriot” as “New England Patriots” and “Baltimore Colt” as “Baltimore Colts.”
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season).
