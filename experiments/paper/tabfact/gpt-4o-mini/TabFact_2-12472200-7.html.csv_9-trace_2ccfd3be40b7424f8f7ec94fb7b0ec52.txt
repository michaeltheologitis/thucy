Claim to verify: "Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round at the French Open 5 years in a row."

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.olga_govortsova (columns: tournament, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011). Rows represent tournament results for Olga Govortsova by year.

Evidence collected
1) Full table retrieval (to confirm structure and available tournaments)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;
Key relevant row observed:
- french open: 2007=a, 2008=3r, 2009=3r, 2010=2r, 2011=2r

2) Direct retrieval of French Open results
SQL executed:
SELECT "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open';
Result:
- 2007: a
- 2008: 3r (Third Round)
- 2009: 3r (Third Round)
- 2010: 2r (Second Round)
- 2011: 2r (Second Round)

3) Unpivot of French Open results into year/result pairs (to make the streak explicit)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, result FROM (
  SELECT '2007' as year, "2007" as result FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open' UNION ALL
  SELECT '2008', "2008" FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open' UNION ALL
  SELECT '2009', "2009" FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open' UNION ALL
  SELECT '2010', "2010" FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open' UNION ALL
  SELECT '2011', "2011" FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'french open'
) AS temp
WHERE result IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY year ASC;
Returned pairs:
- 2007: a
- 2008: 3r
- 2009: 3r
- 2010: 2r
- 2011: 2r

Findings
- Within the available years (2007–2011), Olga Govortsova reached the French Open third round only in 2008 and 2009 (a two-year consecutive streak). She did not reach the third round in 2010 or 2011.
- There is no five-year consecutive streak of third-round appearances in the dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: the longest observed streak is 2 years, not 5.

Assumptions noted
- "3r" denotes third round; "2r" denotes second round; "a" denotes absent or did not participate.
- "French Open" refers to Roland Garros.
- The authoritative dataset available covers 2007–2011; conclusions are based on these years, as no other years are present in the accessible data.
