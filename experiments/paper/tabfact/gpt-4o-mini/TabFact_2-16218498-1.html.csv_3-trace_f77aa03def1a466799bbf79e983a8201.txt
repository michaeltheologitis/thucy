Claim: “botswana defence force xi have a lower agg than arsenal (maseru)”

Data source overview:
- We rely on the table t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (columns: "team 1" text, agg text, "team 2" text, "1st leg" text, "2nd leg" text), which records two-legged ties and aggregate scores (“agg”) for the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs.

Step 1: Confirm both teams exist in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "team 1" AS team_name FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  UNION
  SELECT DISTINCT "team 2" AS team_name FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs;
- Evidence (excerpt from results):
  - Arsenal (Maseru)
  - Botswana Defence Force XI

Step 2: Retrieve the ties involving each team and their aggregate (“agg”)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" 
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
  WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Arsenal%'
     OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Arsenal%'
     OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Botswana%'
     OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Botswana%';
- Returned rows:
  1) Team 1: Botswana Defence Force XI | Agg: 1 - 2 | Team 2: Mbabane Highlanders | 1st Leg: 1 - 1 | 2nd Leg: 0 - 1
  2) Team 1: Arsenal (Maseru)        | Agg: 4 - 0 | Team 2: Eleven Arrows FC     | 1st Leg: 3 - 0 | 2nd Leg: 1 - 0

Analysis:
- For Botswana Defence Force XI’s tie, the aggregate is 1 - 2 with them listed as team 1; their aggregate scored is 1.
- For Arsenal (Maseru)’s tie, the aggregate is 4 - 0 with them listed as team 1; their aggregate scored is 4.
- Comparison: 1 (BDF XI) < 4 (Arsenal Maseru). Therefore, Botswana Defence Force XI have a lower aggregate than Arsenal (Maseru) in their respective ties recorded in this dataset.

Conclusion: The evidence supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “agg” represents the two-legged aggregate score of the tie, formatted as “team 1 goals – team 2 goals”.
- “Lower agg” is interpreted as the aggregate goals scored by the specific team within its tie (first number for team 1, second for team 2). In the returned rows, both teams appear as team 1, so we directly compared the first number in each "agg" field.
