Summary conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset for the TV series “The Baron,” at least one episode written by Tony O’Grady (explicitly noted as a pseudonym of Brian Clemens) was directed by Jeremy Summers.

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a single table: the_baron.
- Table structure (from schema inspection): columns include episode (bigint), prod (bigint), title (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), originalairdate (text), filmed (text).

Evidence 1: Episodes written by Tony O’Grady and their directors
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, prod, title, "written by", "directed by" FROM the_baron WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Tony O''Grady%';
- Result (relevant excerpts):
  • Episode 12, Prod 123, Title: The Maze — Written by: Tony O’Grady (pseudonym of Brian Clemens) — Directed by: Jeremy Summers
  • Episode 26, Prod 119, Title: The Long, Long Day — Written by: Tony O’Grady — Directed by: Roy Baker
- Interpretation: The dataset explicitly marks Tony O’Grady as a pseudonym of Brian Clemens for “The Maze,” and shows Jeremy Summers as director of that episode. Not all Tony O’Grady-written episodes were directed by Summers (e.g., Episode 26), but the claim only asserts existence, which is supported.

Evidence 2: Jeremy Summers-directed episodes (cross-check)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by" FROM the_baron WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Summers%';
- Result (relevant excerpts):
  • Episode 5 — Enemy of the State — Written by: Dennis Spooner — Directed by: Jeremy Summers
  • Episode 12 — The Maze — Written by: Tony O’Grady (pseudonym of Brian Clemens) — Directed by: Jeremy Summers
  • Episode 17 — Time to Kill — Written by: Dennis Spooner — Directed by: Jeremy Summers
- Interpretation: Confirms that Episode 12 (“The Maze”) is one of several episodes directed by Jeremy Summers.

Evidence 3: Direct conjunction of writer and director for precision
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by" FROM the_baron WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Tony O''Grady%' AND "directed by" ILIKE '%Jeremy Summers%';
- Result:
  • Episode 12 — The Maze — Written by: Tony O’Grady (pseudonym of Brian Clemens) — Directed by: Jeremy Summers

Conclusion
- The database explicitly records that Episode 12 (“The Maze”) was written by Tony O’Grady (pseudonym of Brian Clemens) and directed by Jeremy Summers. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions and clarifications
- Interpreted “jeremy summer” as “Jeremy Summers,” the director credited in the dataset.
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (the TV series “The Baron”). The evidence demonstrates at least one such episode; the claim was not interpreted as stating that all Tony O’Grady-written episodes were directed by Jeremy Summers.
