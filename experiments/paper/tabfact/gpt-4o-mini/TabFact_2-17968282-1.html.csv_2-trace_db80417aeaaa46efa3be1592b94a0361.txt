Summary
- Interpreted claim: In the available Argentine Primera División dataset, the column labeled "1991 - 92" contains the value 42, and the column labeled "1993 - 94" contains the value 43.
- Finding: The value 42 does not appear in the "1991 - 92" column; the value 43 does appear in the "1993 - 94" column (for Huracán).

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Available table: public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n (Argentine Primera División 1992–93 related data)

Schema details for public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n
- Columns: team (text), average (double precision), points (bigint), played (bigint), "1991 - 92" (text), "1992 - 93" (text), "1993 - 94" (bigint)
- No primary key or constraints listed

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct values in "1991 - 92" (to check if 42 exists)
- Result: Values present are n / a, 45, 36, 40, 29, 28, 39, 38, 33, 51, 48, 35. The value 42 is not present.
- SQL executed: SELECT DISTINCT "1991 - 92" FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n;

2) Count rows where "1991 - 92" = '42'
- Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE "1991 - 92" = '42';

3) Distinct values in "1993 - 94" (to check if 43 exists)
- Result: Values present include 43 (set: 25, 28, 30, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37, 38, 39, 41, 43, 45, 46, 48)
- SQL executed: SELECT DISTINCT "1993 - 94" FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n;

4) List teams where "1993 - 94" = 43
- Result: Huracán has 43 in "1993 - 94"
- SQL executed: SELECT team, "1993 - 94" FROM public.t_1992_93_argentine_primera_divisi_n WHERE "1993 - 94" = 43;

Conclusion
- The statement "1991 - 92 have a 42" is contradicted by the data (no occurrence of 42 in that column).
- The statement "1993 - 94 have a 43" is supported by the data (Huracán has 43).

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to whether the respective season-labeled columns in the available table contain those values for at least one row (team). No specific team was provided, so existence in the column was taken as the criterion for “have a”.
