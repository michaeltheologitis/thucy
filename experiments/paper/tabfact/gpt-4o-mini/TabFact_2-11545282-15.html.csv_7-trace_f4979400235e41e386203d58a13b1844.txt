Claim to verify: "andre owens play center for the jazz from 2005 - 06"

Data sources consulted: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (authoritative roster data for Utah Jazz, with columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Findings:
- Player identity and tenure: The roster shows Andre Owens on the Utah Jazz with years listed as 2005 - 06.
- Position: The roster lists Andre Owens’ position as Guard, not Center.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Querying for Andre Owens’ roster entry
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Andre Owens');
Result:
- Name: Andre Owens
- Position: Guard
- Years for Jazz: 2005 - 06

2) Cross-checking all Jazz players with last name "Owens"
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE player ILIKE '%Owens%';
Result:
- Andre Owens — Position: Guard — Years for Jazz: 2005 - 06

Assessment:
- True: Andre Owens was with the Utah Jazz in 2005 - 06.
- False: He did not play center; his position is listed as Guard.

Conclusion: The timeframe/team portion is correct, but the position is incorrect.

Assumptions made:
- "play center" is interpreted as the player’s listed position being Center.
- "2005 - 06" refers to the 2005–06 NBA season as recorded in the roster data.
