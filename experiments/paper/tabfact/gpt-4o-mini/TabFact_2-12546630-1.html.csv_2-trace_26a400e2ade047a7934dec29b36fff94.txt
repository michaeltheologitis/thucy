Claim to verify: In the 1933 Giro d'Italia, Gérard Loncke won the race on May 26, despite Alfredo Binda being the race leader.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia.
- Table schema (as reported): columns = date (text, stage date), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text, leader after the stage).

Evidence retrieved:
1) Stage details for May 26, 1933
- Result returned:
  - Date: 26 May
  - Course: Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano
  - Winner: Gerard Loncke (BEL)
  - Race Leader: Alfredo Binda (ITA)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, course, winner, "race leader"
FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
WHERE date = '26 may';

Conclusion:
- The data shows that on May 26 (26 May) of the 1933 Giro d'Italia, Gérard Loncke won the stage from Bassano del Grappa to Bolzano, and Alfredo Binda was the race leader after that stage. This directly supports the claim as stated (interpreting “win the race” to mean “won the stage” on that date while Binda led the general classification).

Assumptions:
- “Win the race on May 26” is interpreted as “won the stage held on May 26” (since the table records stage winners and leaders per stage).
