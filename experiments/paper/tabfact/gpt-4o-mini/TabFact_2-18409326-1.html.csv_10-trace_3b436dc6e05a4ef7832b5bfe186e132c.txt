Claim to verify: “the call sign for Astral Media’s radio station is CJUI-FM.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a table: media_in_kelowna (frequency text, call sign text, branding text, format text, owner text).

Key evidence from the data
1) Ownership of CJUI-FM (formatted as “cjui - fm” in the dataset)
- Result: Owner is Vista Broadcast Group, not Astral Media.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE "call sign" = 'cjui - fm';
- Returned row:
  Frequency: 0 103.9 fm; Call Sign: cjui - fm; Branding: 103.9 the juice; Format: adult hits; Owner: vista broadcast group

2) Stations owned by Astral Media in the dataset
- Result: The station owned by Astral Media is CKFR (AM 1150), not CJUI-FM.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%astral media%';
- Returned row:
  Frequency: 1150 am; Call Sign: ckfr; Branding: am 1150; Format: news / talk; Owner: astral media

3) Full table scan for context (showing both cjui - fm and astral media entries together)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
- Relevant extracted rows from the result:
  - 1150 am | ckfr     | am 1150           | news / talk | astral media
  - 0 103.9 fm | cjui - fm | 103.9 the juice | adult hits   | vista broadcast group

Conclusion
- The data shows that CJUI-FM (cjui - fm) is owned by Vista Broadcast Group, not Astral Media. Astral Media’s station in this dataset is CKFR (AM 1150). Therefore, the claim that Astral Media’s radio station call sign is CJUI-FM is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- Scope is limited to the available “media_in_kelowna” dataset, which appears to catalog Kelowna-area stations.
- “cjui - fm” in the dataset corresponds to CJUI-FM, matching the user’s formatting with spaces around the hyphen.
- Ownership is assessed as recorded in the dataset at the time of data capture.
