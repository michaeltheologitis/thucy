Schema details used:
- Table: will_grace_season_5
  - Columns: series (bigint), season (text), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), original air date (text), us viewers (millions) (double precision)

Evidence gathered:
1) Retrieved the season for the row where series = 101
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season FROM will_grace_season_5 WHERE series = 101;
- Result: season = "10"

2) Verified uniqueness of the series = 101 record
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE series = 101;
- Result: row_count = 1

Conclusion:
- The data shows that the record with series = 101 has season = "10". Therefore, the claim that “series 101 be in season 10” is supported by the available dataset.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the available TabFact dataset and meaning: “The row with series = 101 belongs to season 10.”
- Treated the will_grace_season_5 table as authoritative despite its name suggesting season 5; we relied on the explicit season column value for verification.
