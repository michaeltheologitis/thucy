Summary
- I searched the available MLB dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays season) for a Blue Jays game on September 25 against the Orioles and checked who the pitcher of record was.

Data source discovery
- Available source: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (Toronto Blue Jays 1997 season games)

Schema confirmation
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season';
Result (summary):
- attendance (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), record (text)

Evidence query: September 25 vs. Orioles
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE date = 'september 25' AND opponent ILIKE '%orioles%';
Result (returned row):
- Date: September 25
- Opponent: Orioles
- Score: 4 - 3
- Loss: Mussina (15 - 8)
- Attendance: 28,324
- Record: 73 - 86

Interpretation
- The “Loss: Mussina (15 - 8)” entry indicates Mike Mussina was the losing pitcher in this September 25 game against the Orioles. Therefore, he did not get the win in this game.

Conclusion
- The claim that Mike Mussina got the win in the September 25 game against the Orioles is contradicted by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions
- The user’s unspecified year is interpreted using the only available dataset (1997 Toronto Blue Jays season).
- The “loss” column represents the losing pitcher for the game, which here lists “Mussina (15 - 8)”.
