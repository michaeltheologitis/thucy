Claim interpreted: The statement is taken to mean that in the Wimbledon row of the available results table (for Katrina Adams) there is exactly one occurrence of the result code “a” between 1986 and 1999.

Data source discovery and schema
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: katrina_adams
- Columns: tournament (text), and per-year text columns for 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999. Note: there is no 1987 column in this table.

Evidence 1: Verify Wimbledon is a tournament in this table
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM katrina_adams;
Result (abridged):
- US Open
- Wimbledon
- French Open
- Grand Slam Tournaments
- Australian Open

Evidence 2: Retrieve Wimbledon row and inspect year-by-year results
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM katrina_adams WHERE LOWER(tournament) = LOWER('Wimbledon');
Returned row (values for relevant years):
- 1986 = 'a'
- 1988 = 'sf'
- 1989 = 'qf'
- 1990 = '3r'
- 1991 = 'qf'
- 1992 = '3r'
- 1993 = '1r'
- 1994 = '2r'
- 1995 = '3r'
- 1996 = 'qf'
- 1997 = '3r'
- 1998 = '3r'
- 1999 = '1r'

Analysis
- Counting occurrences of the code 'a' across the available columns from 1986 and 1988–1999 yields exactly one instance: 1986 = 'a'. No other listed year in that span has 'a'.

Conclusion
- Within the data available for 1986 and 1988–1999, there is exactly one 'a' result in the Wimbledon row, occurring in 1986.

Assumptions and limitations
- Subject interpreted as the Wimbledon tournament row in the katrina_adams table (i.e., Katrina Adams’ Wimbledon results), with 'a' interpreted as the “absent” code commonly used in results tables.
- The period “1986 to 1999” is evaluated using the columns present in the dataset. The table does not contain a 1987 column, so we cannot assess that specific year from this source.
