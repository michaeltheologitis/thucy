Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “Johnny Miller place t3.” I interpret this as asking whether Johnny Miller’s placing is T3 in the available dataset (1973 U.S. Open golf).

Data source context:
- Available dataset: A single table in the public schema named t_1973_u_s_open_golf (1973 U.S. Open golf results).
- Relevant columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Search for any player with surname Miller
SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Miller%';
Result:
- Place: t3; Player: Johnny Miller; Country: United States; Score: 71 + 69 = 140; To Par: - 2

2) Case-insensitive exact match on player name
SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" 
FROM t_1973_u_s_open_golf 
WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Johnny Miller')
Result:
- Place: t3; Player: johnny miller; Country: united states; Score: 71 + 69 = 140; To Par: - 2

Conclusion:
- The dataset explicitly records Johnny Miller with place t3.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the placing recorded in the provided dataset (1973 U.S. Open golf table).
- “t3” is interpreted as “tied for 3rd place,” consistent with common golf notation and the table’s place values.
