Claim to verify: “joliette township have a geo id of 3806741020.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Relevant table: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota (columns include: township, county, geo id, etc.)

What the data shows
- The table lists a township named “Joliette” in Pembina County, ND, with GEOID 3806741020. Although the township column stores the name as “Joliette” (without the word “Township”), this table’s context is North Dakota townships, so “Joliette” corresponds to Joliette Township.

Executed SQL evidence
1) Identify the township row and its GEOID
SQL:
SELECT township, county, "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE township ILIKE 'Joliette%'
Result:
- township: Joliette
- county: Pembina
- geo id: 3806741020

2) Confirm the GEOID directly
SQL:
SELECT "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE township ILIKE 'Joliette%'
Result:
- geo id: 3806741020

Conclusion
- The data confirms that Joliette Township (listed as “Joliette”) has GEOID 3806741020.

Assumptions
- “Joliette” in the township field refers to Joliette Township in Pembina County, ND, as the table is specifically a list of North Dakota townships.
