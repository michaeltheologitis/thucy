Analysis
- The database shows Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performed to “All by Myself” by Céline Dion, but the style was Contemporary, not Paso Doble.
- They also performed a Paso Doble, but to “Filet from Le Rêve,” not to “All by Myself.”
- Therefore, the specific claim that they danced a Paso Doble to “All by Myself” is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The song-artist pair (All by Myself – Céline Dion) is correct for Katee & Joshua.
- The style for that performance is Contemporary, not Paso Doble.
- Their Paso Doble used different music.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s message as asserting that Katee Shean and Joshua Allen performed a Paso Doble to “All by Myself” by Céline Dion on So You Think You Can Dance (U.S.) Season 4. Minor formatting differences in how the couple is listed (comma vs. ampersand) are treated as referring to the same pair.
