Claim to verify: “223 be the only episode number with q147 format.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table public.my_info_table (episode bigint, season bigint, format text, title text, "original airdate" text).

Checks performed and evidence
1) Identify all rows with format q147
- Result: One row found, episode 225.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, season, format, title, "original airdate" 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE lower(trim(format)) = 'q147' 
ORDER BY episode ASC;
- Returned row:
  - episode: 225, season: 9, format: q147, title: it's a smurfy life / land of lost and found, original airdate: october 8 , 1988

2) Count distinct episodes with format q147 and list them
- Result: 1 distinct episode, which is 225.
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT episode) AS distinct_episode_count
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(format)) = 'q147';
- Executed SQL (list):
SELECT DISTINCT episode
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(format)) = 'q147';

3) Check episode 223’s format explicitly
- Result: Episode 223 exists but has format q146, not q147.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, season, format, title, "original airdate" 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE episode = 223;
- Returned row:
  - episode: 223, season: 7, format: q146, title: grandpa 's nemesis / grandpa 's walking stick, original airdate: october 1, 1988

Conclusion
- The data shows that the only episode with format q147 is episode 225, not 223. Episode 223 has format q146. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Episode number” refers to the episode column in public.my_info_table.
- “q147 format” refers to records where format equals q147 (matched case-insensitively after trimming to be robust to formatting).
