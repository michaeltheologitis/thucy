Summary of approach:
- Discovered and examined the available data source and schema.
- Queried the games table for any entry on February 4 to verify whether New Jersey was the home team.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (columns: date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Context sample to understand date formatting and nearby entries:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 20;
Result (excerpt shows February entries, e.g., "february 3", "february 5", etc., but no "february 4"):
- february 3 | ny islanders | 7 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 32 - 11
- february 5 | new jersey   | 4 - 5 | washington | 11 - 33 - 11
- february 6 | vancouver    | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 33 - 12
...

2) Direct check for February 4 entries:
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE date ILIKE 'february 4%';
Result: No rows returned.

Findings:
- The dataset contains no game recorded on February 4. Therefore, the statement that the game on February 4 had New Jersey as the home team is not supported. Without any February 4 entry, New Jersey cannot be confirmed (or refuted) as the home team for that date; the claim presupposes a game that does not appear in the data.

Assumptions made:
- "february 4th" corresponds to the date text format used in the table as "february 4".
- The table public.my_info_table is the authoritative source for the games in question; no year is specified, and the table appears to list a single season’s schedule in text form.
