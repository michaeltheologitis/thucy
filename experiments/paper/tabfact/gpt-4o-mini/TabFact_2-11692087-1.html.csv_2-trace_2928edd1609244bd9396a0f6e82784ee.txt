Claim to verify: “the team have be[en] called the Coquitlam Adanacs throughout all 45 season since 1965.”

Summary conclusion based on data: From 1965 through 2009 (45 seasons), there is at least one season (1968) where the team name is recorded as Portland Adanacs, not Coquitlam Adanacs. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source consulted:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: coquitlam_adanacs (columns: season text, "team name" text, games bigint, losses bigint, points bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Establish the count and range of real seasons (exclude non-year aggregate rows)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS seasons_count, MIN(season) AS min_season, MAX(season) AS max_season
  FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
  WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]{4}$';
- Result:
  seasons_count: 45
  min_season: 1965
  max_season: 2009

2) Identify any seasons where the team name differs from Coquitlam Adanacs
- SQL executed:
  SELECT season, "team name"
  FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
  WHERE season ~ '^[0-9]{4}$'
    AND LOWER("team name") <> 'coquitlam adanacs'
  ORDER BY season;
- Result rows:
  - season: 1968; team name: Portland Adanacs

Context note (supporting the filtering step):
- A preliminary look showed an aggregate row labeled season = 'total' with team name = '45 seasons'. Example queries and outputs that revealed this:
  - SQL executed: SELECT season, "team name" FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs LIMIT 20;
  - Sample findings included a non-year season value 'total' and the string '45 seasons' in the team name column. To avoid counting this aggregate, season values were filtered to 4-digit years using season ~ '^[0-9]{4}$'.

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains 45 distinct season-year rows from 1965 to 2009.
- At least one season (1968) records the team name as Portland Adanacs, contradicting the claim that the team was called Coquitlam Adanacs throughout all 45 seasons since 1965.

Assumptions made:
- “Season” refers to individual year entries in the coquitlam_adanacs table; non-year aggregate rows (e.g., season = 'total') are excluded from season counts.
- Name comparisons are case-insensitive (e.g., 'coquitlam adanacs' vs 'Coquitlam Adanacs').
- The table fully represents the team’s naming history for the period 1965–2009 within the available data.
