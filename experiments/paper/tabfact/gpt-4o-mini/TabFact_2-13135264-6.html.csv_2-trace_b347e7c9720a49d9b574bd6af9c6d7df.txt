Claim to verify: "the highest score of the season be detroit, on january 5 with 6 point"

Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret this as: In the available 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season game log, Detroit’s highest single-game goal total was 6 goals, achieved on January 5.
- I interpret "6 point" to mean 6 goals in that game.

What the data source contains
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL table public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text, format "visitor_goals - home_goals"), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). This table logs Detroit’s 2003–04 regular-season games.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Compute Detroit’s goals per game and find the season maximum
- Logic: DetroitGoals = CASE WHEN LOWER(home) = 'detroit' THEN split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int ELSE split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int END
- SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN LOWER(home)='detroit' THEN split_part(score,' - ',2)::int ELSE split_part(score,' - ',1)::int END) AS max_detroit_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: max_detroit_goals = 6

2) List all games where Detroit scored 6 goals (to identify the date and opponent)
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home 
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season 
WHERE (CASE WHEN LOWER(home) = 'detroit' THEN split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int ELSE split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int END) = 6;
- Result: Date: January 5; Visitor: Nashville; Score: 0 - 6; Home: Detroit

3) Cross-check that no opponent exceeded Detroit’s max (to ensure “highest score of the season” belongs to Detroit)
- OpponentGoals = CASE WHEN LOWER(home)='detroit' THEN split_part(score,' - ',1)::int ELSE split_part(score,' - ',2)::int END
- SQL executed (Detroit max):
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN LOWER(home) = 'detroit' THEN split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int ELSE split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int END) AS MaxDetroitGoals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- SQL executed (Opponent max):
SELECT MAX(CASE WHEN LOWER(home) = 'detroit' THEN split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int ELSE split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int END) AS MaxOpponentGoals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: MaxDetroitGoals = 6; MaxOpponentGoals = 5

4) Context: top scoring games (confirming 6 is the peak)
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home,
    CASE WHEN LOWER(home) = 'detroit' THEN split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int ELSE split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int END AS DetroitGoals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
ORDER BY DetroitGoals DESC, date
LIMIT 5;
- Result (top): January 5, Nashville at Detroit, 0 - 6, DetroitGoals = 6; next-highest DetroitGoals were 5 on other dates.

Conclusion
- Supported by the data: Detroit’s highest single-game goal total of the season was 6, achieved on January 5 (home vs Nashville, score 0 - 6). Opponents’ maximum was 5, so Detroit also holds the overall highest single-team game score in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Highest score of the season” refers to the highest number of goals scored by the Detroit Red Wings in a single game within the provided 2003–04 season game log.
- “6 point” is interpreted as 6 goals in that game.
- The date field is stored without a year; the season context is 2003–04, so “January 5” pertains to that season’s January 5.
