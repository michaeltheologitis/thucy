Claim: “justin leonard score a 212 , make him tie for 8th place.”

Conclusion: The data for the 2002 U.S. Open Golf confirms Justin Leonard had a total of 212 and finished tied for 8th (t8).

Evidence from the database
- Data source: public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, "to par")

1) Query to find players with name containing 'Leonard'
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Leonard%';
Result:
- place: t8; player: justin leonard; score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212; to par: + 2

2) Query to match Justin Leonard exactly (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, score, "to par" FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Justin Leonard');
Result:
- place: t8; score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212; to par: + 2

3) Query to confirm tie for 8th (all players with place 't8')
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't8';
Result:
- Nick Faldo — 70 + 76 + 66 = 212
- Justin Leonard — 73 + 71 + 68 = 212
This confirms “t8” (tie for 8th) with multiple players at 212.

Assessment
- The claim is fully supported: Justin Leonard’s total is 212 and his place is t8 (tie for 8th) in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the 2002 U.S. Open, which is the available and authoritative dataset in scope.
- “t8” denotes a tie for 8th place, consistent with common golf notation and verified by multiple players listed at the same position.
