Claim to verify: “jelle van damme score 3 time as much as each of the other 2 player in the uefa champion league tournament.”

Summary of available data sources
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season, covering R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season.

Table structure (no UEFA Champions League field present)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season';
- Resulting columns:
  - player (text)
  - league (bigint)
  - title playoff (bigint)
  - super cup (bigint)
  - total (bigint)

Key observation: The table contains no column for “UEFA Champions League” or any European competition. Therefore, within this authoritative dataset, we cannot extract UEFA Champions League goal totals.

Jelle Van Damme’s stats in the available dataset
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player ILIKE '%van damme%'
- Result:
  - player: Jelle Van Damme; league: 3; title playoff: 0; super cup: 0; total: 3

Context from the same table: players with total = 1
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
  WHERE total = 1;
- Result (examples):
  - víctor bernárdez — total: 1
  - bart goor — total: 1
  - nemanja rnić — total: 1

Assessment against the claim
- The claim specifically asserts a relationship in the “UEFA Champions League tournament.” The only available, authoritative dataset for verification is Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season table, which does not include UEFA Champions League statistics at all. Hence, we have no data here to show Jelle Van Damme’s Champions League goals or to compare them with “the other 2 player[s]” in that tournament.
- Within the scope of this dataset, Jelle Van Damme has 3 total goals for the season, which indeed is triple the total of certain teammates with 1 goal. However, this pertains to Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season competitions captured by the table (league, title playoff, super cup), not the UEFA Champions League.

Conclusion
- The dataset provides no UEFA Champions League statistics and therefore cannot support the claim as stated. Based on the available authoritative data, the statement about the UEFA Champions League is not supported.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to UEFA Champions League goal totals for Jelle Van Damme and two other unspecified players in some season or tournament phase.
- Verification is constrained to the available dataset (Anderlecht 2008–09), which does not contain Champions League data; no external data was used beyond the provided data source.
