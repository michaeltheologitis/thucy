Claim to verify: "henrik stenson be from australia , aaron baddeley be from south korea , and charlie wi be from sweden"

Data source consulted: public.t_2008_pga_championship (2008 PGA Championship), which includes columns: place, player, country, score, to par.

Evidence from the data:
- Henrik Stenson — Sweden
- Aaron Baddeley — Australia
- Charlie Wi — South Korea

Executed SQL that produced the evidence:
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Stenson%' OR player ILIKE '%Baddeley%' OR player ILIKE '%Wi%';

Returned rows:
- (Henrik Stenson, Sweden)
- (Charlie Wi, South Korea)
- (Aaron Baddeley, Australia)

Conclusion based on evidence:
- The claim reverses the actual countries for all three golfers found in the dataset.
  - Henrik Stenson is listed as Sweden, not Australia.
  - Aaron Baddeley is listed as Australia, not South Korea.
  - Charlie Wi is listed as South Korea, not Sweden.

Additional executed SQL (attempted exact-match lookup; returned no rows, included here for completeness):
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player IN ('Henrik Stenson', 'Aaron Baddeley', 'Charlie Wi');

Assumptions:
- "be from" is interpreted as the nationality field (country) recorded in the 2008 PGA Championship dataset for each player.
