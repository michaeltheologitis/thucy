Claim: “there be 2 project in rankin county , sonford product and flowood site”

Summary of findings:
- The Mississippi Superfund data shows exactly two Superfund site records in Rankin County.
- Their names are “sonford products” and “flowood site,” matching the user’s items aside from a minor plurality difference (“product” vs “products”).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all Rankin County records
- Result:
  - CERCLIS ID: msd980710941 | Name: flowood site | County: rankin | Proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983 | Listed: 09 / 21 / 1984 | Construction Completed: 09 / 17 / 1993 | Partially Deleted: - | Deleted: 02 / 16 / 1996
  - CERCLIS ID: msd086556388 | Name: sonford products | County: rankin | Proposed: 09 / 27 / 2006 | Listed: 03 / 07 / 2007 | Construction Completed: - | Partially Deleted: - | Deleted: -
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "cerclis id", name, county, proposed, listed, "construction completed", "partially deleted", deleted
FROM list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE LOWER(county) = LOWER('Rankin');

2) Count Rankin County records
- Result: 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE LOWER(county) = LOWER('Rankin');

Conclusion:
- The data supports that there are two Superfund sites in Rankin County named “sonford products” and “flowood site.” The claim is correct aside from the minor plurality difference in “sonford product(s).”

Assumptions made:
- “project” refers to entries in the Mississippi Superfund sites table (i.e., Superfund projects/sites in Rankin County).
