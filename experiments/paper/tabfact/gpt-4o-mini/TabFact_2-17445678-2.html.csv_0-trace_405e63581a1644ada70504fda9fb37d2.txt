Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a table named brad_gumm.
- Inspected the schema of public.brad_gumm to understand available columns relevant to fights (res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location).
- Queried the table to check whether there is a fight held in South Dakota, United States, versus an opponent named Brian Dunn, with round = 2.

Schema details
- Table: public.brad_gumm
- Columns:
  - res (text)
  - record (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - method (text)
  - event (text)
  - round (bigint)
  - location (text)

Evidence from data
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.brad_gumm WHERE LOWER(location) LIKE '%south dakota%' AND LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%brian dunn%' AND round = 2;

- Result (matching row summarized):
  - event: msf - total destruction
  - location: south dakota , united states
  - method: submission (rear naked choke)
  - opponent: brian dunn
  - record: 5 - 1 - 1
  - res: win
  - round: 2

Conclusion
- The data shows a fight against Brian Dunn that took place in South Dakota, United States, and ended in round 2. This directly supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “2 round match” as “the fight ended in round 2,” consistent with the round field in the dataset, which records the finishing round rather than the number of scheduled rounds.
