Claim to verify: “fukusyū no puropōzu have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: tsuki_no_koibito (episodes with romanized title and broadcast date)

Step 1: Confirm table structure
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'tsuki_no_koibito';

Result (columns):
- Unnamed: 0 (text)
- episode title (text)
- romanized title (text)
- translation of title (text)
- broadcast date (text)
- ratings (text)

Step 2: Rank episodes by actual broadcast date (most recent = 1)
Note: broadcast date is stored as text like “may 24 , 2010”. We parse it to a proper date and then rank by that parsed date.

Executed SQL:
SELECT 
  "romanized title", 
  "broadcast date", 
  TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date,
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD , YYYY') DESC) AS rank
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito;

Result (romanized title, broadcast date, parsed_date, rank):
1. saishūshōjomakuwakare | june 14 , 2010 | 2010-06-14 | 1
2. suki to ietara iinoni | june 7 , 2010 | 2010-06-07 | 2
3. konna ni suki dattanda… | may 31 , 2010 | 2010-05-31 | 3
4. fukusyū no puropōzu | may 24 , 2010 | 2010-05-24 | 4
5. arienai kisu | may 17 , 2010 | 2010-05-17 | 5
6. omae ga hosii | may 10 , 2010 | 2010-05-10 | 6

Step 3: Retrieve the rank of “fukusyū no puropōzu” directly
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank
FROM (
  SELECT ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD , YYYY') DESC) AS rank,
         "romanized title"
  FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
) AS ranked
WHERE "romanized title" = 'fukusyū no puropōzu';

Result:
- rank = 4

Conclusion
- The episode “fukusyū no puropōzu” ranks 4th most recent by broadcast date, not 2nd. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “2nd most recent” means sorted by broadcast date in descending order (most recent = 1).
- The field “broadcast date” was parsed using the format Month DD , YYYY.
- Matching was done against the exact romanized title string present in the dataset: “fukusyū no puropōzu”.
