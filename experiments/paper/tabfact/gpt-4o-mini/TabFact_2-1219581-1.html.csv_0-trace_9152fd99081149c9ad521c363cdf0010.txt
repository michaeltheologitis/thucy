Summary of approach
- Discovered and reviewed available data sources and schema.
- Queried the zakspeed database to retrieve the engine information for the Zakspeed 891 chassis.

Data source discovery
- Available database: zakspeed (public schema).
- Relevant table: public.zakspeed
  - Columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint)

Evidence 1: Filter by the season associated with the 891
- Result: Year 1989, Chassis "zakspeed 891", Engine(s) "yamaha v8".
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)" FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year = 1989;

Evidence 2: Directly search for the chassis designation
- Result: Year 1989, Chassis "zakspeed 891", Engine(s) "yamaha v8".
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)" FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis ILIKE '%891%';

Assessment
- Both targeted queries return the Zakspeed 891 with engine(s) listed as "yamaha v8". This directly supports the claim that the Zakspeed 891 chassis had a Yamaha V8 engine.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Formula 1 Zakspeed 891 chassis used in 1989.
- The "engine (s)" field denotes the engine manufacturer and configuration for that chassis-season entry.
