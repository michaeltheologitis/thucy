Scope and data sources examined:
- Discovered available data: a PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with a single table: list_of_csi_miami_characters, containing character-level metadata for CSI: Miami, including each character’s first episode title.
- Relevant columns: character (text), position (text), actor (text), "first episode" (text), "final episode" (text), duration (text), "final episode count" (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify any DEA agent(s) in CSI: Miami and check their first episode
- Result: Found one character with DEA in name/position: Bob Keaton, Position: DEA Agent, Actor: Max Martini, First Episode: Big Brother.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position, actor, "first episode" 
FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters 
WHERE character ILIKE '%DEA%' OR position ILIKE '%DEA%';

2) Check whether any character’s first episode is titled "Vengeance"
- Result: No rows where the first episode equals or contains "Vengeance".
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position, actor, "first episode" FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters WHERE "first episode" ILIKE '%Vengeance%';

Findings:
- Within the CSI: Miami characters dataset, the (only) DEA Agent listed is Bob Keaton, whose first appearance episode is "Big Brother"—not "Vengeance". No characters have a first episode titled "Vengeance".

Conclusion:
- The claim that “the first episode for [the] DEA agent [is] Vengeance” is not supported by the available data; it is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “DEA agent” as referring to the DEA Agent character(s) present in the available CSI: Miami character dataset.
- Interpreted “first episode” as the character’s first appearance episode title, per the table’s "first episode" field.
