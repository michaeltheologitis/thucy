What I checked
- I explored the available data sources and found a database (TabFact) with a table public.my_info_table that contains demographic indicators by period, including “live births per year” and “deaths per year.”

Evidence from data
- The row for the period 1965 - 1970 in public.my_info_table shows:
  - live births per year: 3,330,000
  - deaths per year: 998,000
  - natural change per year: 2,332,000
- These figures directly match the claim of 3,330,000 live births per year and 998,000 deaths per year for 1965–1970.
- Consistency check: 3,330,000 − 998,000 = 2,332,000 (matches the recorded natural change per year), reinforcing the data’s internal consistency.

Executed SQL (exact)
SELECT period, "live births per year", "deaths per year", "natural change per year" 
FROM public.my_info_table;

Result excerpt relevant to the claim
- 1965 - 1970 | 3,330,000 | 998,000 | 2,332,000

Conclusion
- The claim is supported exactly by the data in public.my_info_table.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the same dataset represented by public.my_info_table.
- “Per year” reflects the average annual values over the 1965–1970 period, as implied by the column names and period grouping in the table.
