Claim interpreted: The user appears to ask whether Cooperstown (assumed “Cooper town”) is known/famous for the Blanchard Bridge, implying an association between Cooperstown and the Blanchard Bridge.

Findings grounded in data:
- The data source lists a “Blanchard Bridge” located in Blanchard, Traill County, not in Cooperstown.
- Cooperstown (Griggs County) is associated with the “Romness Bridge,” not the Blanchard Bridge.
- No entry links “Blanchard Bridge” to Cooperstown.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate entries with ‘Blanchard’ in the name
- Result:
  • Name: Blanchard Bridge; Listed: 1997-02-27 removed 2009-03-25; Location: Blanchard; County: Traill; Type: Pratt through truss
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, listed, location, county, type FROM my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Blanchard%';

2) Confirm whether Cooperstown has any entries and what they are
- Result:
  • Name: Romness Bridge; Listed: 1997-02-27; Location: Cooperstown; County: Griggs; Type: Pratt Through Truss
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, listed, location, county, type FROM my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE '%Cooperstown%';

3) Check explicitly for any entry tying ‘Blanchard’ to ‘Cooperstown’
- Result: No rows returned.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, location, county FROM my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Blanchard%' AND location ILIKE '%Cooperstown%';

Conclusion:
- The data shows Blanchard Bridge is located in Blanchard (Traill County), not Cooperstown. Cooperstown is associated with Romness Bridge. Therefore, the claim that Cooperstown is famous for the Blanchard Bridge is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Cooper town” refers to Cooperstown, North Dakota.
- “Famous for” is interpreted as an association or location claim linking the town to that specific landmark.
- “Blanchard Bridge” refers to the entry labeled “Blanchard Bridge” in the provided authoritative dataset.
