Claim interpreted: In the 2005 MLB season, the Milwaukee Brewers played the St. Louis Cardinals one day before playing the Cincinnati Reds (i.e., Cardinals on date D, Reds on D+1).

Data source discovery
- Available database contains a public table likely representing the Brewers’ 2005 schedule: t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season.

Schema verification (with executed SQL)
1) Identify tables related to Brewers:
SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog','information_schema') AND table_name ILIKE '%brewers%';

2) List columns for the discovered table:
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season' ORDER BY ordinal_position;

3) Check primary key:
SQL:
SELECT kcu.column_name FROM information_schema.table_constraints tc JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu ON tc.constraint_name=kcu.constraint_name AND tc.table_schema=kcu.table_schema WHERE tc.table_schema='public' AND tc.table_name='t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season' AND tc.constraint_type='PRIMARY KEY';

Resulting structure used for analysis:
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). No primary key.

Verification analysis
A. Direct test for “Cardinals then Reds on the next day” anywhere in 2005
SQL executed:
WITH games AS (
  SELECT to_date(initcap(date) || ' 2005','FMMonth DD YYYY') AS game_date,
         lower(opponent) AS opponent
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
)
SELECT c.game_date AS cardinals_date, r.game_date AS reds_date
FROM games c
JOIN games r ON r.game_date = c.game_date + INTERVAL '1 day'
WHERE c.opponent LIKE '%cardinals%'
  AND r.opponent LIKE '%reds%'
ORDER BY c.game_date;

Evidence returned:
- Cardinals Date: 2005-09-25
- Reds Date: 2005-09-26

B. Context check around those dates to confirm sequence
SQL executed:
WITH games AS (
  SELECT to_date(initcap(date) || ' 2005','FMMonth DD YYYY') AS game_date,
         lower(opponent) AS opponent
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
)
SELECT to_char(game_date,'YYYY-MM-DD') AS game_date, opponent
FROM games
WHERE game_date BETWEEN DATE '2005-09-24' AND DATE '2005-09-27'
ORDER BY game_date;

Evidence returned:
- 2005-09-24: cardinals
- 2005-09-25: cardinals
- 2005-09-26: reds
- 2005-09-27: reds

Conclusion
The data shows that the Brewers played the Cardinals on September 25, 2005, and then played the Reds the very next day, September 26, 2005. This directly satisfies the claim that, in the 2005 season, they played the Cardinals one day before playing the Reds.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions due to phrasing ambiguity
- “cardinal” interpreted as the St. Louis Cardinals; “red” interpreted as the Cincinnati Reds.
- “1 day before” interpreted as consecutive calendar days (D and D+1).
