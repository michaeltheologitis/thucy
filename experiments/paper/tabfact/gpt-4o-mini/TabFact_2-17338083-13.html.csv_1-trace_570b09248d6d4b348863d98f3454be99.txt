Claim interpreted: For the state of Jin, the relevant name(s) are “xi” or “xian.”

Evidence from available data:
- Data source: TabFact database, public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc (columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, from).

1) Full table inspection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc;
- Relevant rows observed for state = jin:
  • state: jin | type: sovereign | name: xi | title: marquis | royal house: ji | from: 840 bc
  • state: jin | type: sovereign | name: xian | title: marquis | royal house: ji | from: 822 bc

2) Targeted filter for Jin
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'jin';
- Result:
  • From: 840 bc | Name: xi | Royal House: ji | Title: marquis | Type: sovereign
  • From: 822 bc | Name: xian | Royal House: ji | Title: marquis | Type: sovereign

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows that, for the state “jin,” the sovereigns listed for the period covered include names “xi” and “xian.” Thus, the claim that “xi or xian be the name when the state be jin” is supported by the data in this table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the phrasing as referring to the names of the sovereigns of the state of Jin in the provided dataset/timeframe (820s BC context).
