Summary
- Claim: “Nick Faldo is a player from Ireland.”
- Finding: The available authoritative dataset lists Nick Faldo’s country as England, not Ireland.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table t_2002_u_s_open_golf, which includes player names and their countries.

Schema details (from schema exploration)
- Table: t_2002_u_s_open_golf
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify Nick Faldo’s listed country
- SQL executed:
SELECT player, country FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Faldo%';
- Result:
  - player: Nick Faldo | country: England

2) Verify how Irish players are recorded (sanity check)
- SQL executed:
SELECT player, country FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE country ILIKE '%Ireland%';
- Result:
  - player: Pádraig Harrington | country: Ireland

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly lists Nick Faldo’s country as England. Therefore, the claim that he is from Ireland is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Country” in the table denotes the player’s represented country/nationality for the tournament. The t_2002_u_s_open_golf table is treated as authoritative for the players it includes.
