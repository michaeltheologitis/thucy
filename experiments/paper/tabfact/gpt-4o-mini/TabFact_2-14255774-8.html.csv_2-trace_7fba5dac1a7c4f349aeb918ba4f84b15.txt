Claim to verify: “2 game have a score of more than 10 point.”

Data source overview
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public, table t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season with columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Understanding the score format
- Sample rows to inspect the score column:
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 10;
Observation: The score values look like “8 - 6”, which (based on consistency with the team record changes) corresponds to opponent_runs - Diamondbacks_runs.

Checks performed
1) How many games where the Diamondbacks scored more than 10 runs?
Result: 0
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_above_10_runs
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[- ](\d+)$') AS INTEGER) > 10;

2) How many games where the opponent scored more than 10 runs? Also list them.
Result: 2 games
- September 21 vs Rockies, Score: 13 - 4
- September 25 vs Cardinals, Score: 12 - 3
SQL (list):
SELECT date, opponent, score 
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season 
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) > 10;
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season 
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) > 10;

3) How many games where either team (opponent or Diamondbacks) scored more than 10 runs?
Result: 2
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_score_count
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
WHERE (CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) > 10 OR CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '(\d+)$') AS INTEGER) > 10);

Conclusion
- There are 2 games in which at least one team scored more than 10 runs (both instances are the opponent scoring >10). Thus, the claim that “2 game have a score of more than 10 point” is supported if interpreted as “in two games, a team’s score exceeded 10.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted “have a score of more than 10 point” as: in a game, at least one team’s run total exceeded 10.
- If instead the claim meant “the Diamondbacks scored more than 10,” the count would be 0 (not 2), as shown above.
