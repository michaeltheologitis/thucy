Claim to verify: “there be an 64.64 point difference between the highest score (186.92) and the lowest score (122.28)”

What I checked
- Identified the highest and lowest values in the “points” column of the table t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships.
- Computed the difference between these two values.
- Retrieved the specific rows corresponding to the max and min points for confirmation.

Findings from the data
- Highest points: 186.92 (matches the claim’s highest score)
- Lowest points: 112.28 (does not match the claim’s 122.28)
- Difference (max − min): 74.64 (does not match the claim’s 64.64)

Executed SQL and results
1) SQL: SELECT MAX(points) AS max_points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
   Result: max_points = 186.92

2) SQL: SELECT MIN(points) AS min_points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
   Result: min_points = 112.28

3) SQL: SELECT (SELECT MAX(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships) - (SELECT MIN(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships) AS difference;
   Result: difference = 74.64

4) SQL: SELECT rank, name, nation, points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE points = (SELECT MAX(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships);
   Result: Rank 1, Name: Linda Fratianne, Nation: United States, Points: 186.92

5) SQL: SELECT rank, name, nation, points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE points = (SELECT MIN(points) FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships);
   Result: Rank 31, Name: Gloria Mas, Nation: Spain, Points: 112.28

Conclusion
- The claim’s highest score (186.92) matches the data.
- The lowest score and the stated difference are incorrect. The actual lowest score is 112.28, yielding a difference of 74.64, not 64.64.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to the “points” column in the t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships table.
- The claim pertains to this dataset specifically.
