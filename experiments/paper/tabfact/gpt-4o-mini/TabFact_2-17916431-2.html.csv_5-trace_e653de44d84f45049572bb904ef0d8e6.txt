Claim interpreted: March appears most often as the month in the match date than any other month, followed by April with 4 games.

Data source explored
- Database: public
- Table: t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)
- Date format: textual, e.g., "9 august 2008" (day month year)

Schema confirmation
- The table stores match dates as text in the column date.

Evidence 1: Count of matches by month (direct extraction of month token)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT LOWER(SUBSTRING(date FROM '^[^ ]+ ([^ ]+)')) AS month_name, COUNT(*) AS month_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
GROUP BY month_name;
- Result (normalized to capitalized month names for readability):
  - January: 5
  - February: 5
  - March: 7
  - April: 3
  - August: 4
  - September: 4
  - October: 6
  - November: 4
  - December: 5
- Interpretation: March has the highest count (7). April has 3, not 4, and is not second-highest; October is second with 6.

Evidence 2: Month counts ordered by frequency (alternate parsing cross-check)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT
    to_char(to_date(split_part(date, ' ', 2) || ' ' || split_part(date, ' ', 3), 'Month YYYY'), 'FMMonth') AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM
    t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
GROUP BY
    month
ORDER BY
    match_count DESC;
- Result:
  - March: 7
  - October: 6
  - December: 5
  - February: 5
  - January: 5
  - November: 4
  - August: 4
  - September: 4
  - April: 3
- Interpretation: Confirms Evidence 1.

Evidence 3: Explicit listing of March and April matches
- Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE date ILIKE '%March%' OR date ILIKE '%April%';
- Result:
  - March: game 34 (3 March 2009), 35 (7 March 2009), 36 (10 March 2009), 37 (14 March 2009), 38 (17 March 2009), 39 (21 March 2009), 40 (28 March 2009) → 7 matches
  - April: game 41 (4 April 2009), 42 (10 April 2009), 43 (13 April 2009) → 3 matches

Conclusion
- True: March is the most frequent month in the date column (7 matches), more than any other month.
- False: April is not next; April has 3 matches, not 4. The second-most frequent month is October (6 matches).

Assumptions
- “Month in the date” refers to the month extracted from the text column date in t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season.
- “Game” corresponds to a row in this table, i.e., a match.
- The claim is evaluated over the full 2008–09 season present in this table.
