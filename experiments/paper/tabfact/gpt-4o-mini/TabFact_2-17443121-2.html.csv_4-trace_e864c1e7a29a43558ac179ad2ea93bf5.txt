Claim to verify: “there be only 2 new episode of gary unmarried in december 2009.”

Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and its contents.
- Inspected the table structure and all rows to understand coverage and air-date formats.
- Queried for any episodes in December 2009.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: gary_unmarried
  - Columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect all available rows to understand coverage and air-date format
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.gary_unmarried;
- Result (abridged):
  The table lists episodes from September 24, 2008 through May 20, 2009. Months are stored as lowercase text (e.g., “december 10, 2008”). No rows extend beyond May 20, 2009, and there are no entries for December 2009.

2) Direct count of rows in December 2009 (attempt using date-range comparison on text column)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" >= '2009-12-01' AND "air date" < '2010-01-01';
- Result: 0
  Note: The air date column is text with spelled-out months; the primary evidence remains the full-table inspection above.

3) Pattern search for “December 2009” in the air date field
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" LIKE '%December 2009%';
- Result: 0
  Note: Months are lowercase in this dataset (e.g., “december”), but the complete row dump in step (1) shows no December 2009 entries regardless of case.

Conclusion
- The available, authoritative dataset lists episodes only up to May 20, 2009 and contains no entries for December 2009. Therefore, within the scope of this data, there is no evidence of any, let alone exactly two, new episodes in December 2009. The claim is unsupported by the accessible data.

Assumptions and notes
- “New episode” is interpreted as an episode with its original air date in December 2009.
- The verification relies solely on the provided database; it appears to contain season 1 data through May 2009 and does not cover later 2009 dates. As instructed, conclusions are based strictly on the accessible data, which in this case does not include December 2009 airings.
