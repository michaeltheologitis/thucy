Claim interpreted: The user asserts that (a) episode 11 premiered on October 9, 2012, (b) the coach was named Rebecca Star, and (c) the summary was “Ashley is made into a circus performer.”

Data source explored: public.made_tv_series (trusted authoritative source per instructions) with columns season, episode, episode summary, premier date, external link, coach.

Evidence gathered
1) Check for any episode with premier date “October 9, 2012”
- Result: No matching records.
- SQL executed: SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE "premier date" LIKE '%October 9, 2012%';

2) Check for any episode coached by someone named Rebecca (to locate “Rebecca Star”)
- Result: Found one record:
  • Season: 13
  • Episode: 13
  • Premier Date: October 15, 2012
  • Coach: Rebecca Star
  • Episode Summary: Ashley is made into a circus performer.
- SQL executed: SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE coach ILIKE '%Rebecca%';

3) Verify the summary phrase “Ashley is made into a circus performer”
- Result: One record found (same as above):
  • Season: 13, Episode: 13, Premier Date: October 15, 2012, Coach: Rebecca Star
- SQL executed: SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE "episode summary" ILIKE '%Ashley is made into a circus performer%';

4) Identify episode 11 in 2012
- Result: Found episode 11 in 2012, but details do not match the claim:
  • Season: 13
  • Episode: 11
  • Premier Date: October 11, 2012
  • Coach: Katie Kansas
  • Episode Summary: Shambre is made into a gogo dancer.
- SQL executed: SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE episode = 11 AND "premier date" LIKE '%2012%';

5) Re-check for any exact match on the stated date string
- Result: No records with premier date containing 'October 9, 2012'.
- SQL executed: SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE "premier date" LIKE '%October 9, 2012%';

Assessment of the claim
- Episode number: The episode with coach Rebecca Star and the Ashley/circus-performer summary is Episode 13, not Episode 11.
- Premier date: The relevant episode premiered on October 15, 2012, not October 9, 2012.
- Coach: Rebecca Star is correct, but associated with Episode 13, not Episode 11.
- Summary: “Ashley is made into a circus performer” is accurate for Episode 13.

Corrected statement (based on the data): Season 13, Episode 13 of the series (premiered October 15, 2012) features coach Rebecca Star, and the summary is “Ashley is made into a circus performer.” Episode 11 (premiered October 11, 2012) features coach Katie Kansas with the summary “Shambre is made into a gogo dancer.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to MTV’s “Made” series, represented by the public.made_tv_series table.
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing as asserting all three attributes (episode number, premiere date, coach, and summary) describe a single episode.
