Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns: district TEXT, incumbent TEXT, party TEXT, first elected BIGINT, result TEXT, candidates TEXT)

Goal interpreted: Verify whether the dataset records incumbent Sidney R. Yates’s “first elected” year as 1964.

Evidence gathered:
1) Attempt exact-name match for incumbent
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent = 'Sidney R. Yates';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Perform a partial-name search for Yates
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Yates%';
Result (one row):
- District: Illinois 9
- Incumbent: Sidney R. Yates
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: 1964
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Sidney R. Yates (D) unopposed

Conclusion:
- The authoritative dataset for the 1974 U.S. House elections lists Sidney R. Yates as an incumbent with “First Elected” = 1964. This supports the claim that his (recorded) first elected year, per this dataset, is 1964.

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “fourth elect” in the user’s query is interpreted as a typographical error for “first elected.” The available dataset contains a “first elected” field but has no concept of “fourth elected,” so the verification is performed against the “first elected” field.
