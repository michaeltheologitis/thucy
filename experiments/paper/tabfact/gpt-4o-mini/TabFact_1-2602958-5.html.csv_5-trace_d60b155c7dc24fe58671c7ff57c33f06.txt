Claim: In the Gilmore Girls episode “Ballroom and Biscotti,” the writer is Matthew Diamond.

Findings grounded in data
1) Episode credit for “Ballrooms and Biscotti”
- Evidence: Querying the episodes table for the title shows the writer is Amy Sherman-Palladino (not Matthew Diamond). Director is also Amy Sherman-Palladino.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, director, "writer (s)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('Ballrooms and Biscotti');
- Result:
  • Title: Ballrooms and Biscotti
  • Director: Amy Sherman-Palladino
  • Writer(s): Amy Sherman-Palladino

2) Whether Matthew Diamond is credited as writer anywhere in the dataset
- Evidence: Searching for any episodes where either the director or writer(s) contains “Matthew Diamond” shows he appears as a director on certain episodes, but not as a writer.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, director, "writer (s)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE LOWER(director) LIKE '%matthew diamond%' OR LOWER("writer (s)") LIKE '%matthew diamond%';
- Results (selected):
  • The Hobbit, the Sofa and Digger Stiles — Director: Matthew Diamond — Writer(s): Amy Sherman - Palladino
  • An Affair to Remember — Director: Matthew Diamond — Writer(s): Amy Sherman - Palladino
  • Luke Can See Her Face — Director: Matthew Diamond — Writer(s): Amy Sherman - Palladino, Daniel Palladino

Conclusion
- The dataset lists “Ballrooms and Biscotti” as written by Amy Sherman-Palladino. Matthew Diamond is credited as a director on some episodes but not as a writer for this episode (and not as a writer elsewhere in the dataset). The claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Gilmore Girls episode titled “Ballrooms and Biscotti” (plural), which is the standard title in the dataset.
