Summary
I explored the available data source (public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season) to verify whether there are any players in a round higher than 4 whose nationality is either Canada or the United States. The data indicates that while there are Canadian and U.S. players in the table, none are in rounds greater than 4.

Data exploration and evidence
1) Distinct nationalities present (to confirm exact values to filter by)
Executed SQL:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season
GROUP BY nationality;

Result:
- United States: 2 players
- Canada: 7 players
- Sweden: 1 player

2) Count of rows meeting the condition round > 4 and nationality in ('Canada', 'United States')
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season WHERE round > 4 AND nationality IN ('Canada', 'United States');

Result:
- 0 rows

3) Attempt to list the matching players (returned no rows)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "round", nationality
FROM public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season
WHERE "round" > 4 AND nationality IN ('Canada','United States')
ORDER BY "round" ASC, player ASC;

Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion
Based on the table public.t_2007_08_los_angeles_kings_season, there are no players in rounds higher than 4 who are from either Canada or the United States.

Assumptions
- “Round higher than 4” is interpreted as round > 4.
- “Either Canada or the United States” is matched to nationality values exactly equal to 'Canada' or 'United States' as they appear in the data.
- The verification is scoped to the available dataset (Los Angeles Kings 2007–08 season table).
