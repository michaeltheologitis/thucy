Claim interpreted: On March 15, 2007, for entries in the 'region 4' field, the highest number of episodes is 4.

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: volume (bigint, not null), discs (bigint, not null), episodes (bigint, not null), "region 1" (text, not null), "region 2" (text, not null), "region 4" (text, not null)
  - Note: The column "region 4" stores text values that appear to be dates (e.g., "march 15 , 2007").

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Establish data presence and inspect possible matching dates in "region 4"
- Result: total_rows = 5
- Result: Distinct values of "region 4" include: march 13 , 2008; march 15 , 2007; march 5 , 2009; july 5 , 2007; june 19 , 2008
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
  SELECT DISTINCT "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY "region 4" ASC LIMIT 50;

2) Retrieve rows with "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007' and inspect episodes
- Result rows:
  - volume: 1, discs: 1, episodes: 4
- SQL executed:
  SELECT volume, discs, episodes FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007';

3) Compute the maximum number of episodes for rows where "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007'
- Result: MAX(episodes) = 4
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(episodes) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" = 'march 15 , 2007';

Conclusion
- The data shows that on 'march 15 , 2007' (as stored in the "region 4" column), the highest number of episodes is 4. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "on march 15 , 2007 and in region 4" to mean: rows where the text value of the column named "region 4" equals 'march 15 , 2007'.
- Interpreted "highest number of episode" as the maximum value of the numeric column "episodes" among those rows.
