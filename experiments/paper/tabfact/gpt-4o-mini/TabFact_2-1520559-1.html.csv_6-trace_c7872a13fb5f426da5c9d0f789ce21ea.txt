Summary
- Claim: “Karrie Webb [was] the runner-up in 2008 and [became] the champion in 2010 and 2011.”
- Interpreted domain: Women’s British Open (based on the available database).
- Finding: The data shows this claim is false for the Women’s British Open. In 2008 the champion was Jiyai Shin (runner-up Yani Tseng). In both 2010 and 2011, the champion was Yani Tseng, not Karrie Webb. No record shows Karrie Webb as champion in 2010 or 2011, nor as runner-up in 2008.

Evidence from data (with exact executed SQL)
1) Champions and runners-up for 2008, 2010, 2011
- Result:
  - 2008: Champion – Jiyai Shin; Runner-up – Yani Tseng
  - 2010: Champion – Yani Tseng; Runner-up – Katherine Hull
  - 2011: Champion – Yani Tseng; Runner-up – Brittany Lang
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2008, 2010, 2011);

2) Check if Karrie Webb appears as champion or runner-up in 2008, 2010, or 2011
- Result: No rows returned (Karrie Webb does not appear as champion or runner-up in those years).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM women_s_british_open 
  WHERE year IN (2008, 2010, 2011)
    AND (champion LIKE '%Karrie Webb%' OR "runner (s) - up" LIKE '%Karrie Webb%');

3) Context (where Karrie Webb does appear near those years)
- 2009 row (for context): Champion – Catriona Matthew; Runner(s)-up – Karrie Webb.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM women_s_british_open WHERE year = 2009;

Conclusion
- The table shows:
  - 2008: Runner-up was Yani Tseng, not Karrie Webb.
  - 2010 and 2011: Champion was Yani Tseng in both years, not Karrie Webb.
- Therefore, the claim is not supported by the Women’s British Open data and is inaccurate for this event.

Assumptions
- Because the only available authoritative dataset is the public.women_s_british_open table, I interpreted the claim as referring to the Women’s British Open results.
