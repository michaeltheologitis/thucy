Claim to verify: “the boston celtic achieved their lowest score game against the philadelphia 76s.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: public schema
- Table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season (columns: game bigint, date text, opponent text, score text, location text, record text)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to confirm score format
- Purpose: Determine if the score column is formatted as Celtics points first, then opponent points.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season LIMIT 10;
- Evidence observed: Rows include entries like “104 - 102” with record increasing after such games, indicating the score format is Celtics points – Opponent points. Example includes a game vs “philadelphia 76ers” with score “113 - 97,” consistent with Celtics points listed first.

Step 2: Compute the minimum Celtics points in 1984-85 and list the game(s)
- Purpose: Identify the lowest-scoring game and the opponent involved.
- Executed SQL (minimum):
  SELECT MIN(CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS min_celtics_points
  FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: 86
- Executed SQL (games with that minimum):
  SELECT game, date, opponent, score, location
  FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  WHERE CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INTEGER) = 86;
- Result: Game 40, Date: January 18, 1985, Opponent: Indiana Pacers, Score: 86 - 91, Location: Market Square Arena.

Step 3: List Celtics games vs Philadelphia 76ers and their points
- Purpose: Check whether any game vs the 76ers corresponds to the lowest Celtics point total.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, score, location, CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) AS celtics_points
  FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  WHERE opponent = 'philadelphia 76ers';
- Results:
  - Date: January 20, 1985 | Score: 113 - 97 | Location: Boston Garden | Celtics Points: 113
  - Date: January 30, 1985 | Score: 104 - 122 | Location: The Spectrum | Celtics Points: 104

Step 4: Corroborate by listing the five lowest-scoring games
- Purpose: Provide additional context on the lowest-scoring games and opponents.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, location, CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) AS celtics_points
  FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  ORDER BY celtics_points ASC, date ASC
  LIMIT 5;
- Results (lowest to higher):
  - 86 vs Indiana Pacers (Market Square Arena)
  - 97 vs Seattle SuperSonics (Boston Garden)
  - 103 vs Washington Bullets (Boston Garden)
  - 104 vs Los Angeles Lakers (Boston Garden)
  - 104 vs Philadelphia 76ers (The Spectrum)

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (Boston Celtics 1984-85 season), the Celtics’ lowest-scoring game was 86 points against the Indiana Pacers, not the Philadelphia 76ers. Games vs the 76ers in this dataset feature Celtics point totals of 113 and 104, which are not the season low.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope is limited to the available data: the Boston Celtics’ 1984-85 season as represented in public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season. No other seasons or playoff data were available in the accessible database.
- Interpreted “lowest score game” as the lowest single-game point total by the Celtics in that season.
- Interpreted “philadelphia 76s” as the Philadelphia 76ers.
