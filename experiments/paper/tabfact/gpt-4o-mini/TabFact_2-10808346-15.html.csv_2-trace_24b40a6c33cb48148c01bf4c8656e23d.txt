Claim interpreted: The user is asserting that there exists a match in the available data where Melbourne was the away team, Richmond was the home team, and Richmond’s home team score was 9.10 (64).

Data source discovered: public.t_1943_vfl_season (1943 VFL season). Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text). No primary key.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Direct exact-name lookup for home = 'Richmond' and away = 'Melbourne'
SQL: SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE "away team" = 'Melbourne' AND "home team" = 'Richmond';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Case-insensitive partial match to accommodate naming variations
SQL: SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE LOWER("away team") LIKE '%melbourne%' AND LOWER("home team") LIKE '%richmond%';
Result: 1 row found: Home Team: Richmond; Home Team Score: 15.19 (109); Away Team: Melbourne; Away Team Score: 12.13 (85); Venue: Punt Road Oval; Crowd: 9000; Date: 21 August 1943.

3) Check whether any such Richmond (home) vs Melbourne (away) match had home team score exactly '9.10 (64)'
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE LOWER("away team") LIKE '%melbourne%' AND LOWER("home team") LIKE '%richmond%' AND "home team score" = '9.10 (64)';
Result: No rows returned.

4) Check whether any match with Melbourne as away had a home team score of '9.10 (64)'
SQL: SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE "away team" = 'Melbourne' AND "home team score" = '9.10 (64)';
Result: No rows returned.

5) Count of Richmond(home) vs Melbourne(away) matches (case-insensitive)
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%richmond%' AND LOWER("away team") LIKE '%melbourne%';
Result: 1.

Conclusion: The data confirms a Richmond (home) vs Melbourne (away) match in 1943, but Richmond’s home team score in that game was 15.19 (109), not 9.10 (64). Therefore, the specific claim that Richmond, with home team score 9.10 (64), was Melbourne’s opponent as the away team is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “be away team Melbourne’s home team opponent” is interpreted as: Melbourne was the away team and Richmond was the home team in the same match.
- Verification is limited to the available 1943 VFL season dataset (public.t_1943_vfl_season).
