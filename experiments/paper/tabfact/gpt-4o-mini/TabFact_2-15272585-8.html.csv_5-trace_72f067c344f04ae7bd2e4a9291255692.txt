Claim to verify: "Galina Voskoboeva played a total of 3 games on a hard tennis court, and 1 on clay."

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with schema public. Primary table identified: public.galina_voskoboeva.

- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'galina_voskoboeva';
- Result columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Surface values overview
- SQL executed:
  SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.galina_voskoboeva GROUP BY surface;
- Result:
  - hard (i): 2
  - hard: 1
  - clay: 2

Match listings by surface (evidence)
- Clay matches
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT date, tournament, opponent, surface FROM galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface ILIKE 'clay';
  - Results:

Aggregate counts used to verify the claim
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches_hard FROM galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface IN ('hard', 'hard (i)');
  Result: 3
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches_clay FROM galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface = 'clay';
  Result: 2

Conclusion
- The data shows 3 matches on hard (including indoor hard) and 2 matches on clay. Therefore, the claim is correct for hard-court matches (3) but incorrect for clay (claim says 1; data shows 2).

Assumptions
- Interpreted "game" as "matches" recorded in the public.galina_voskoboeva table.
- Counted both 'hard' and 'hard (i)' as hard-court matches (indoor hard included).
