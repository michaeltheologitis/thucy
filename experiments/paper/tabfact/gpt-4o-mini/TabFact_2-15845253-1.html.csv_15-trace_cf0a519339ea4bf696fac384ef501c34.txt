Claim to verify: “9 of the viral disease replicate outside the nucleus.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered dataset: public.viral_disease (PostgreSQL)
- Schema (via introspection):
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)
  - The replication site column indicates where replication occurs (nucleus vs cytoplasm).

Evidence from data:
1) Distinct replication sites and counts
SQL:
SELECT "replication site", COUNT(*) as record_count
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "replication site";
Result:
- Cytoplasm: 14
- Nucleus: 9

2) Direct counts by site
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cytoplasm_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';
Returned: 14

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS nucleus_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
Returned: 9

Conclusion:
- “Outside the nucleus” corresponds to cytoplasmic replication. The dataset shows 14 cytoplasmic (outside nucleus) and 9 nuclear (inside nucleus). Therefore, the claim that 9 replicate outside the nucleus is not supported; the correct count is 14.

Assumptions made:
- “Outside the nucleus” is interpreted as replication site = cytoplasm.
- “Viral disease” refers to records in the public.viral_disease table of the available dataset.
