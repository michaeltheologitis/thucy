Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and identified a single relevant table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season in the TabFact database, which contains game-level leader stats (including high rebounds) for the Charlotte Bobcats’ 2009–10 season.
- Inspected the table schema and a sample of rows to understand the structure and the format of the “high rebounds” field.
- Parsed the numeric value from the “high rebounds” text and computed the maximum single-game rebounds recorded in this dataset. Then listed the game(s) corresponding to that maximum.

Key evidence from the data
1) Table schema
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season';

2) Sample rows (to confirm data format)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season LIMIT 10;

Observed example (from returned rows):
- game 51 | date: february 10 | team: minnesota | high rebounds: nazr mohammed (20)

3) Maximum single-game rebounds value in 2009–10 dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("high rebounds" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS max_rebounds FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;

Result:
- max_rebounds = 20

4) Games with that maximum
SQL executed:
SELECT date, team, "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("high rebounds" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) = 20;

Result row(s):
- date: february 10 | team: minnesota | high rebounds: nazr mohammed (20)

Conclusion
- Within the available 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season dataset, the highest single-game rebounds recorded by a Bobcats player is 20, achieved by Nazr Mohammed on February 10 against Minnesota. This directly supports the claim for that season.
- The data source only covers the 2009–10 season; it does not allow verification of an all-time franchise record across other Bobcats seasons.

Assumptions
- “Bobcat player” refers to a Charlotte Bobcats player.
- “In 1 game” refers to a single NBA game.
- Verification is limited to the 2009–10 season due to the scope of the available dataset; no inference is made about other seasons.
