Summary
- Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that (the Drop Tower: Scream Zone installation at) Kings Island opened before 1999.
- Finding: The data shows the Kings Island entry has Opened = 1999, not before 1999.

Data source reconnaissance
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with a single table public.drop_tower_scream_zone.
- Table columns: park, tower height, drop height, speed, model, opened, height requirement.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for an entry matching Kings Island or King Island and return the opened year
SQL:
SELECT opened FROM drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE park ILIKE 'Kings Island' OR park ILIKE 'King Island';
Result: 1999

2) List any parks containing the word 'Island'
SQL:
SELECT park FROM drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE park ILIKE '%Island%';
Result: Kings Island

3) Retrieve the full row for Kings Island to confirm context (model and opened)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE park ILIKE '%Kings Island%';
Result:
- Park: Kings Island
- Tower Height: 315 feet
- Drop Height: 264 feet
- Speed: 67 mph
- Model: Gyro Drop
- Opened: 1999
- Height Requirement: inches (cm)

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the Kings Island entry with Opened = 1999. Therefore, the claim that it opened before 1999 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The term "king island" is interpreted as "Kings Island" (the amusement park) in the context of this specific dataset about the Drop Tower: Scream Zone installations; thus, "opened" refers to the ride’s opening year at Kings Island, not the park’s founding year.
- Only the available dataset was used to verify the claim, as instructed.
