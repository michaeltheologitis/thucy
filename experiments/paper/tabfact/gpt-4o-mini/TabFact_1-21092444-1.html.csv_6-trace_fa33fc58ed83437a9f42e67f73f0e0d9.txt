Assessment relative to the claim
- Claim: “the black knight lose to stanford 21 - 10.”
- Data shows Army vs Stanford in 1975 ended 67–14 (Stanford over Army), not 21–10. A 21–10 loss occurred vs Duke, not Stanford.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (1975 Army Cadets/Black Knights season). If the claim refers to a different season, it falls outside the accessible data, and no contrary evidence is available here.
