Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and inspected its structure.
- Queried the standings to extract the top two positions and their points.
- Calculated the point gap between 1st and 2nd.

Data source
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1940_in_brazilian_football (columns: position bigint, team text, points bigint, played bigint, against bigint, difference text)

Evidence from executed SQL and results
1) Retrieve team names and points for the top two positions
SQL:
SELECT team, points FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT 2;
Result:
- Flamengo — 13 points
- Fluminense — 13 points

2) Retrieve only the points for the top two positions
SQL:
SELECT points FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT 2;
Result:
- 13
- 13

3) Compute the point gap (leader points minus second place points)
SQL:
SELECT MAX(points) - MIN(points) as point_gap FROM (SELECT points FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT 2) AS subquery;
Result:
- point_gap = 0

4) Explicitly list positions 1 and 2 with teams and points
SQL:
SELECT position, team, points FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position IN (1, 2);
Result:
- Position 1: Flamengo — 13 points
- Position 2: Fluminense — 13 points

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: The top two teams have different points, with the 2nd behind by 2.
- Finding: Both teams have the same points (13). The point gap is 0, not 2.
- Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the available 1940 Brazilian football standings table (public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football).
- Assumed the column position defines the ranking order and points is the standings points used to compare the top two teams.
