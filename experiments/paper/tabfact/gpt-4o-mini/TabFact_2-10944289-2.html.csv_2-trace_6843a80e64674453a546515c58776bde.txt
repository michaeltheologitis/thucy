Claim: "on september 17 , the final score at texas stadium be 10 - 27"

Data sources explored
- Discovered an NBC Sunday Night Football results database with a single table: public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present (coverage: 2006–present).
- Schema (as reported by the schema tool):
  - date (text)
  - visiting team (text)
  - final score (text)
  - host team (text)
  - stadium (text)

Evidence
1) Confirming the presence of Texas Stadium in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT stadium FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present;
Result (excerpt): Includes "Texas Stadium" among distinct stadium names.

2) Retrieving all games at Texas Stadium
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "host team", "visiting team", "final score"
FROM nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Texas Stadium%';
Results returned by the tool:
- Date: September 17, Host Team: Dallas Cowboys, Visiting Team: Washington Redskins, Final Score: 10 - 27
- Date: December 10, Host Team: Dallas Cowboys, Visiting Team: New Orleans Saints, Final Score: 42 - 17
- Date: December 25, Host Team: Dallas Cowboys, Visiting Team: Philadelphia Eagles, Final Score: 23 - 7

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists a game at Texas Stadium on "September 17" with a final score of 10 - 27 (Cowboys vs. Washington). This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data from the NBC Sunday Night Football results table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the NBC Sunday Night Football entry for the date string "September 17" at Texas Stadium; the dataset stores date as text without an explicit year in this context.
- No additional context (e.g., year or competition beyond NBC SNF) was specified, so verification is confined to this authoritative dataset.
