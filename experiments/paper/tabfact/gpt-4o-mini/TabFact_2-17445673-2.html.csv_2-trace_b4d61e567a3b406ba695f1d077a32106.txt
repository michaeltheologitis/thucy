Claim interpreted: “only 2 match be play through 3 round.” I interpret this as: there are only 2 fights in the dataset that reached round 3 (i.e., fights recorded with round = 3).

Data discovery and validation
- Enumerated available schemas and tables to locate relevant data.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name
  FROM information_schema.tables
  WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';

- Listed columns to understand the structure of the relevant table.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name
  FROM information_schema.columns;

Findings from discovery
- The public schema contains a table: public.tim_lajcik
- The table has columns including: event, method, opponent, record, res, round, time

Data extraction
- Verified table content and total row count.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.tim_lajcik;
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.tim_lajcik;
  Result: 14 rows total.

- Counted fights that reached round 3.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS fights_to_round_3
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  WHERE round = 3;
  Result: 2

- Listed the fights that reached round 3 for confirmation.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT event, opponent, res, method, time
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  WHERE round = 3;
  Results:
  1) pancrase - 2001 neo - blood tournament second round | Opponent: osami shibuya | Result: win | Method: decision (unanimous) | Time: 5:00
  2) ufc 22 | Opponent: ron waterman | Result: draw | Method: draw | Time: 5:00

- Distribution check by round (sanity check):
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT round, COUNT(*) AS fight_count
  FROM public.tim_lajcik
  GROUP BY round
  ORDER BY round;
  Results: Round 1: 10, Round 2: 2, Round 3: 2

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 2 fights recorded with round = 3. This supports the claim that only 2 matches were played through 3 rounds.

Assumptions
- “play through 3 round” is interpreted as fights that reached round 3 (i.e., recorded with round = 3). No fights in this dataset go beyond 3 rounds, and there are no round-3 stoppages; both round-3 entries are decisions/draws, which are consistent with going the distance to round 3.
