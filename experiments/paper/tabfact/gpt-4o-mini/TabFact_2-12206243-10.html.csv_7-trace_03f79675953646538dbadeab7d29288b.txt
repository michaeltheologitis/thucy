Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source(s), inspected the table schema, and queried the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays game logs to verify how many times the Blue Jays scored exactly 12 runs in a given month.

Data source discovery
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Finding: A PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (Toronto Blue Jays 1997 season).

Table structure confirmation
- Tool: Schema query
- Result: t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season columns:
  - date (text) — game date (e.g., “September 8”)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text) — formatted like “12 - 10”
  - loss (text) — appears to store the losing pitcher’s name and record
  - attendance (bigint)
  - record (text) — team W-L record after the game

Executed evidence queries and results
1) Sample rows to validate date and score format
SQL:
SELECT date, score FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt returned by the tool:
- September 8 | 12 - 10 (confirms at least one 12-run game in September)

2) Identify which side of “score” corresponds to Blue Jays and surface additional 12-run evidence
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS blue_jays_score, split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS opponent_score
FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE loss IS NOT NULL;
Result excerpt returned by the tool (subset shown):
- September 8 | Angels | 12 | 10
- September 27 | Red Sox | 12 | 5
This output (along with the earlier sample) indicates two separate September games with the Blue Jays scoring 12 runs: September 8 (12-10) and September 27 (12-5).

3) Count of 12-run games by month
SQL:
WITH game_counts AS (
    SELECT LOWER(SPLIT_PART(date, ' ', 1)) AS month,
           COUNT(*) AS game_count
    FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
    WHERE SPLIT_PART(score, ' - ', 1)::int = 12
    GROUP BY month
) 
SELECT month, game_count
FROM game_counts
ORDER BY CASE month
    WHEN 'april' THEN 1
    WHEN 'may' THEN 2
    WHEN 'june' THEN 3
    WHEN 'july' THEN 4
    WHEN 'august' THEN 5
    WHEN 'september' THEN 6
END;
Tool-reported result: For September, game_count = 2.

Conclusion
- Interpreting “the month” as a specific calendar month within the 1997 season, the data shows the Blue Jays scored exactly 12 runs twice in September (not once). Therefore, the claim that they scored 12 runs “1 time during the month” is not supported for September 1997.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user’s phrase “the month” to refer to a month within the 1997 season because that is the only available authoritative dataset.
- Interpreted “score 12 run” to mean “scored exactly 12 runs in a game.”
- Took the left side of the score string (split_part(score, ' - ', 1)) to represent the Blue Jays’ runs, consistent with the tool’s own splitting and returned examples.
