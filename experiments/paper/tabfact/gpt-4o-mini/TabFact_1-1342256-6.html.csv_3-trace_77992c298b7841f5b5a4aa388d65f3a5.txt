Claim: “Alfred J. Elliott [was] re‑elect[ed] to California’s 10th district in 1937.”

Data source consulted: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 (authoritative in this context).

Findings from the data
1) Identify California’s 10th congressional district entry and its incumbent/result in 1942
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, result, candidates 
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 
WHERE district ILIKE 'California %';
- Returned evidence (relevant row excerpt):
  • district: california 10
  • incumbent: alfred j elliott
  • party: democratic
  • result: re - elected
  • candidates: alfred j elliott (d) unopposed

2) Retrieve the full row for California’s 10th to see the “first elected” year
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE district = 'california 10';
- Returned evidence (full row fields summarized):
  • district: california 10
  • incumbent: alfred j elliott
  • party: democratic
  • first elected: 1937
  • result: re - elected
  • candidates: alfred j elliott (d) unopposed

Assessment
- The table indicates Alfred J. Elliott was first elected in 1937 and (as of 1942) was re‑elected. Therefore, the data shows 1937 as his first election year, not a re‑election year. The claim that he was re‑elected in 1937 is not supported by the data.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative data, Alfred J. Elliott was first elected in 1937 and re‑elected later (e.g., in 1942), so the specific assertion of a 1937 re‑election is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- “California’s 10th district” is interpreted as the U.S. House congressional district.
- The verification leverages the 1942 election table’s “first elected” field to infer whether 1937 was a first‑election or re‑election year.
