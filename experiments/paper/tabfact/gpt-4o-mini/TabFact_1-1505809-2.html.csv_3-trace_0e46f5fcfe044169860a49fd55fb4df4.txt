Claim interpreted: “48 is the value of ends lost when the blank ends is 9” within the available 2005 Tim Hortons Brier dataset.

Data source consulted
- Table: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier (TabFact database)

Evidence
- I queried rows where "blank ends" = 9 and inspected the corresponding "ends lost" value(s).

Executed SQL
SELECT locale, skip, "blank ends", "ends lost" FROM t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 9;

Query result
- locale: Northern Ontario; skip: Mike Jakubo; blank ends: 9; ends lost: 48

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that for the row with blank ends = 9, ends lost = 48. This supports the claim as stated in the context of this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted specifically with respect to the available 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table. It asserts that for entries where "blank ends" equals 9, the value of "ends lost" is 48; the dataset contains one such entry, which matches 48.
