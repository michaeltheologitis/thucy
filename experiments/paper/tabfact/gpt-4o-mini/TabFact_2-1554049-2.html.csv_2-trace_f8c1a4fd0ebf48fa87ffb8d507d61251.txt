Summary
- Interpreted the claim as: In the available table of tennis matches (public.ji_nov_k), for the row where the opponent is Roger Federer, the surface is clay.

Data source and schema review
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with schema public and table ji_nov_k.
- Table public.ji_nov_k columns: date (TEXT), tournament (TEXT), surface (TEXT), opponent (TEXT), score (TEXT). All NOT NULL.

Evidence
1) Count rows where opponent contains 'Federer'
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Federer%';
Result: row_count = 1

2) Retrieve opponent and surface for those rows
SQL: SELECT opponent, surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Federer%';
Result: opponent = roger federer; surface = clay

3) Retrieve full row details for opponent Roger Federer
SQL: SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Roger Federer';
Result: date = July 13, 2003; tournament = Gstaad, Switzerland; surface = Clay; opponent = Roger Federer; score = 5 - 7, 6 - 3, 6 - 3, 1 - 6, 6 - 3

Conclusion
- The table contains exactly one row with opponent Roger Federer, and its surface is Clay. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the surface field in the table public.ji_nov_k for the row where opponent equals Roger Federer (case-insensitive match).
