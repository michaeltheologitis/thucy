Summary conclusion: The claim that “the competition that he won on June 2, 2007 was a friendly” is contradicted by the data. On June 2, 2007, the competition was “uefa euro 2008 qualifying” and the result was “lost,” not a friendly and not a win.

Data discovery and schema:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database, schema public
- Table: branimir_suba_i
- Columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Query to list rows in 2007:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, competition, result FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE date::date >= '2007-01-01' AND date::date < '2008-01-01'
- Returned rows (relevant excerpt):
  - Date: June 2, 2007; Competition: uefa euro 2008 qualifying; Result: lost

Analysis:
- The specific record for June 2, 2007 shows the competition was a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match, not a friendly.
- The result recorded is “lost,” not a win.

Answer: The claim is inaccurate based on the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “He” refers to the subject represented by the table branimir_suba_i.
- “Win” corresponds to rows where the result column equals “win.”
- Dates in the date column are parseable to actual dates (as used in the query).
