Claim to verify: “the frequency mhz for call sign W269AX and the frequency for call sign W273AE be 93.9 FM and 105.9 FM, respectively.”

Data discovery summary
- Discovered database: wyfk (PostgreSQL), schema: public.
- No station tables were available. Verification proceeded using the deterministic FCC FM channel-to-frequency relationship, executed as SQL constant expressions.

Method and evidence
FM translator call signs in the U.S. encode the FM channel as the three-digit number in the call sign (e.g., W269AX → channel 269). The standard mapping between FM channel (N) and frequency (MHz) is:
- freq_mhz = 87.9 + 0.2 × (N − 200)
- Inverse: channel = 200 + (freq_mhz − 87.9)/0.2

Evidence 1: Frequency for channel 269 (W269AX)
Executed SQL:
SELECT 269 AS channel, 87.9 + 0.2 * (269 - 200) AS freq_mhz;
Result: channel = 269, freq_mhz = 101.7

Evidence 2: Frequency for channel 273 (W273AE)
Executed SQL:
SELECT 273 AS channel, 87.9 + 0.2 * (273 - 200) AS frequency_mhz;
Result: channel = 273, frequency_mhz = 102.5

Evidence 3: Channel corresponding to 93.9 MHz (to test the first claimed frequency)
Executed SQL:
SELECT 200 + (93.9 - 87.9) / 0.2 AS channel;
Result: channel = 230

Evidence 4: Channel corresponding to 105.9 MHz (to test the second claimed frequency)
Executed SQL:
SELECT 105.9 AS frequency, 200 + (105.9 - 87.9) / 0.2 AS channel;
Result: frequency = 105.9, channel = 290

Findings
- W269AX (channel 269) should be 101.7 MHz, not 93.9 MHz.
- W273AE (channel 273) should be 102.5 MHz, not 105.9 MHz.
- 93.9 MHz corresponds to channel 230 (not 269), and 105.9 MHz corresponds to channel 290 (not 273).

Conclusion
The provided frequencies do not match the channel numbers embedded in the call signs and are therefore incorrect.

Assumptions
- The call signs W269AX and W273AE are U.S. FM translator/booster call signs that follow FCC nomenclature, where the three-digit number is the FM channel.
- The standard U.S. FM channel-to-frequency formula applies.
