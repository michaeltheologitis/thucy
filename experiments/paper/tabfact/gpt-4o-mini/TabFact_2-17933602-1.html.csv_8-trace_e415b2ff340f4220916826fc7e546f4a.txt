Claim to verify: "porto be 1st in the liga for the 2003 - 2004 season , follow by benfica , both from the city of porto"

Data source discovery:
- Available database includes a table: public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga with columns: club (text), head coach (text), city (text), stadium (text), and "2003 - 2004 season" (text). This table records, among other things, each club’s city and their outcome in the 2003-2004 season.

Evidence gathered:
- Query objective: Retrieve the rows for Porto and Benfica, returning their city and the value recorded for the 2003-2004 season.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT club, city, "2003 - 2004 season" 
FROM t_2004_05_primeira_liga 
WHERE club ILIKE '%Porto%' OR club ILIKE '%Benfica%';

- Query results (as returned by the database):
  - Club: Porto; City: Porto; 2003 - 2004 Season: 1st in the liga
  - Club: Benfica; City: Lisbon; 2003 - 2004 Season: 2nd in the liga

Assessment against the claim:
- "porto be 1st in the liga for the 2003 - 2004 season": Supported by the data (Porto: 1st in the liga).
- "follow by benfica": Supported by the data (Benfica: 2nd in the liga).
- "both from the city of porto": Contradicted by the data (Benfica’s city is Lisbon, not Porto).

Conclusion: The standings portion of the claim is correct, but the statement that both clubs are from the city of Porto is false.

Assumptions made:
- "Liga" refers to Portugal’s top division (Primeira Liga/SuperLiga for 2003-2004).
- "Porto" refers to FC Porto; "Benfica" refers to SL Benfica (Sport Lisboa e Benfica).
