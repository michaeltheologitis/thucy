  - Week 3 — date: “september 26 , 1976” — opponent: Tampa Bay Buccaneers — result: w 14 - 9 — attendance: 44505
  - Highest attendances visible in the season listing include 77683, 71009, 66875, etc., all greater than 44505.

2) Maximum attendance in the season
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season);
- Result: Week 1 — date: September 13, 1976 — opponent: Miami Dolphins — result: Loss (30 - 21) — attendance: 77,683.

3) Exact attendance for September 13, 1976

Assessment
- The largest attendance of the 1976 Buffalo Bills season was 77,683, and it occurred on September 13, 1976 vs. the Miami Dolphins.
- An attendance of 44,505 occurred on September 26, 1976 vs. the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, not on September 13, 1976, and it was not the season’s largest attendance.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Largest attendance” refers to the largest single-game attendance for the Buffalo Bills 1976 season as represented in table t_1976_buffalo_bills_season.
- The date string “september 13 , 1976” corresponds to the exact formatting used in the dataset’s date column.
