Claim interpreted: “Two of the viral diseases are in Baltimore group III.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.viral_disease.

Schema inspection (public.viral_disease)
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)
- No primary key listed

Evidence step 1: Count entries by Baltimore group
- Result summary (distinct groups with counts):
  - group i: 5
  - group ii: 1
  - group iii: 1
  - group iv: 7
  - group v: 7
  - group vi: 1
  - group vii: 1
- Executed SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "baltimore group", COUNT(*) as count FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY "baltimore group";

Evidence step 2: Retrieve entries in Baltimore group III
- Rows found for group iii: 1
  - family: reoviridae; baltimore group: group iii; envelopment: non - enveloped; virion shape: icosahedral; replication site: cytoplasm
- Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "baltimore group" = 'group iii';

Conclusion
- The dataset shows only 1 entry in Baltimore group III, not 2. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Viral disease” refers to entries in the public.viral_disease table.
- “Baltimore group III” corresponds to the value "group iii" in the baltimore group column, as enumerated by the data.
- Counts reflect exactly what is present in this dataset; no external sources were used.
