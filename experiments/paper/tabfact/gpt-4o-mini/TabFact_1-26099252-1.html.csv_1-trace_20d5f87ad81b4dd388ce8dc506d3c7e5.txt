Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources.
- Inspected the relevant schema to identify where codec information is stored.
- Queried the table for the Android Browser on Android to retrieve Theora and H.264 values.

Data source discovery:
- Accessible data source: PostgreSQL database with public schema containing a table named html5_video.

Schema inspection:
- Table: public.html5_video
  - Columns: browser (text), operating system (text), latest stable release (text), theora (text), h264 (text), vp8 ( webm ) (text), vp9 ( webm ) (text)
  - No keys or indexes.

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", theora, h264 
  FROM html5_video 
  WHERE browser = 'android browser' AND "operating system" = 'android';
- Result:
  - Browser: Android Browser
  - Operating System: Android
  - Latest Stable Release: 4.2.1 Jelly Bean (November 27, 2012)
  - Theora: 2.3
  - H264: 3.0

Assessment:
- The claim states: "the android browser for android have a theora version of 2.3 and an h264 version of 3.0".
- The data for Android Browser on Android shows Theora = 2.3 and H264 = 3.0, matching the claim exactly.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data in the html5_video table.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “android browser for android” as the entry where browser = "Android Browser" and operating system = "Android" in the html5_video table.
- Interpreted theora and h264 column values as the relevant version/level indicators as recorded in the dataset, without external reinterpretation.
