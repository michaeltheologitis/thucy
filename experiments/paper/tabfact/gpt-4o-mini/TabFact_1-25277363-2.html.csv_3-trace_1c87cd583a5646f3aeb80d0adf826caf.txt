Claim to verify: "fast friend originally air on october11 , 1992"

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact
- Available table: public.full_house_season_7
  - Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text)

Evidence gathered
1) Locate any episode with title containing "Fast Friend"
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in season", title, "original air date" FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE title ILIKE '%Fast Friend%';
Result:
- no in season: 5
- title: fast friends
- original air date: october 12, 1993

2) Check if any episode aired on October 11, 1992
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "original air date" FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE "original air date" = 'October 11, 1992';
Result:
- No rows returned

Assessment
- Title: The dataset shows the episode title as "fast friends" (plural), not "fast friend".
- Date: The original air date is October 12, 1993, not October 11, 1992.
- No episode in this table has an original air date of October 11, 1992.

Conclusion
Based on the authoritative Full House Season 7 data, the claim is incorrect: the episode "Fast Friends" originally aired on October 12, 1993, not October 11, 1992.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the Full House episode titled "Fast Friends" (as that is the only relevant "Fast Friend(s)" entity available in the accessible data).
