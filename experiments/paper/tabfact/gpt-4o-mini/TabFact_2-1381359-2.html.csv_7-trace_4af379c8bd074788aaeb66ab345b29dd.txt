Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. In the 32nd edition, Meiji were the winners, and the runner-up was Waseda—not Hosei. Therefore, Meiji was not the loser in that game, and Hosei was not the runner-up for the 32nd edition.

Evidence from the database (TabFact.public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship):

1) Identify the 32nd edition (winner and runner-up)
SQL:
SELECT winner, "runner - up", score FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE title = '32nd'
Result:
- winner: Meiji
- runner - up: Waseda
- score: 43 - 9
Interpretation: Meiji won the 32nd edition; Waseda was runner-up. This directly contradicts the claim that Hosei was runner-up and that Meiji was the loser.

2) Check whether any edition has Hosei as runner-up
SQL:
SELECT title, winner, "runner - up", score 
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
WHERE LOWER("runner - up") LIKE '%hosei%';
Results:
- Title: 30th | Winner: Meiji | Runner-up: Hosei | Score: 41 - 12
- Title: 37th | Winner: Kanto Gakuin University | Runner-up: Hosei | Score: 42 - 15
Interpretation: Hosei appears as runner-up in the 30th and 37th editions, not the 32nd. Notably, in the 30th edition where Hosei was runner-up, Meiji was the winner (not the loser).

3) Directly verify existence of a 32nd edition with Hosei as runner-up
SQL:
SELECT * FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE title = '32nd' AND "runner - up" = 'Hosei';
Result:
- No rows returned.
Interpretation: There is no record of the 32nd edition having Hosei as runner-up.

Assumptions made:
- "game that have a title of 32nd" is interpreted as the 32nd edition (final) of the All Japan University Rugby Championship.
- "looser" is interpreted as "loser" (i.e., the team that lost the final), and "runner - up" refers to the team listed as runner-up in the final.
