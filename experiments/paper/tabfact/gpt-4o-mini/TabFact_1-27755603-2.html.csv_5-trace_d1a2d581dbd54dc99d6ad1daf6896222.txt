Claim interpreted: The user asserts that in the game where the high points were “rodney stuckey (16)”, the high rebounds were “ben gordon (17)”. I verify this against the 2010–2011 Detroit Pistons season table.

Data source overview
- Database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
- Relevant columns: game, date, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists

Evidence
1) Distinct high-points entries (to confirm presence of “rodney stuckey (16)” and formatting)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "high points", COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
GROUP BY "high points"
ORDER BY "high points" ASC;
Result excerpt (relevant values):
- ben gordon (17)
- rodney stuckey (16)
- rodney stuckey (25)
- rodney stuckey (34)

2) Identify the game where high points = “rodney stuckey (16)” and check its high rebounds
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season 
WHERE "high points" = 'rodney stuckey (16)';
Result:
- Game: 3
- Date: October 11
- Score: W 94 - 85 (OT)
- High Points: rodney stuckey (16)
- High Rebounds: greg monroe (7)
- High Assists: richard hamilton (7)
Interpretation: In the game where high points were “rodney stuckey (16)”, the high rebounds were by Greg Monroe (7), not Ben Gordon (17).

3) Check whether Ben Gordon ever appears as a high rebounder (for completeness)
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points", "high rebounds" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season 
WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%ben gordon%'
Result (example):
- Game: 1; Date: October 5; Score: L 89 - 105 (OT); High Points: Ben Gordon (17); High Rebounds: Ben Gordon, Charlie Villanueva (5)
Interpretation: Ben Gordon is listed as a (co-)leader for rebounds in another game, but not in the game where high points were “rodney stuckey (16)”.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that when “rodney stuckey (16)” was the high points, the high rebounds were “greg monroe (7)”. Therefore, the claim that “ben gordon (17) do the high rebound in the game in which rodney stuckey (16) do the high point” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “do the high point/rebound” is interpreted as the team-high entries recorded in the “high points” and “high rebounds” columns of the 2010–2011 Detroit Pistons season dataset.
- Player names and figures are matched exactly to the text values stored in those columns (e.g., “rodney stuckey (16)”).
