Claim to verify: "when the grid be 5, the least amount of lap be 43.0"

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix
- Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Interpretation: We interpret the claim as stating that among entries with grid position = 5 in this race table, the minimum value of the laps column is 43.0 (i.e., 43 laps).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) SQL to compute the minimum laps for grid=5:
SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 5;
Result: min_laps = 43

2) SQL to show the row(s) at grid=5 for context:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 5;
Result (summary): driver = Michele Alboreto; constructor = Ferrari; laps = 43; time / retired = Engine failure; grid = 5

Assessment:
- The minimum number of laps for grid position 5 is 43. The claim states 43.0, which is a formatting difference only. The data supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- "grid be 5" refers to rows where grid = 5 in t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix.
- "least amount of lap" refers to MIN(laps).
- 43.0 is taken as numerically equivalent to 43 (integer).
