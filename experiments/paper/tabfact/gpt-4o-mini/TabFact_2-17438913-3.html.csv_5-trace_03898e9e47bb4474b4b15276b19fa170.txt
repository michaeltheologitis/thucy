Claim to verify: “carlos cuéllar have the lowest transfer fee of any player at 7.8 m.”

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season transfers)
- Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text)

Step 1: Inspect all transfer fees and players
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "transfer fee", "moving to", type, "transfer window" FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
- Evidence highlights from results:
  - carlos cuéllar — 7.8 m — aston villa — transfer — summer
  - filip šebo — 1 m — valenciennes — transfer — summer
  - daniel cousin — 3.5 m — hull city — transfer — summer
  - jean - claude darcheville — free — valenciennes — transfer — winter
  - chris burke — free — cardiff city — transfer — winter
  - Many entries show “n / a” for fee (loans, end of contract, etc.)

Step 2: Compute numeric minimum and maximum transfer fees among entries with explicit numeric amounts
- Executed SQL to compute min and max:
  SELECT MIN(CAST(replace("transfer fee", ' m', '') AS numeric)) AS min_transfer_fee, MAX(CAST(replace("transfer fee", ' m', '') AS numeric)) AS max_transfer_fee
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE "transfer fee" LIKE '% m' AND replace("transfer fee", ' m', '') ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$';
- Result:
  - Minimum numeric transfer fee: 1.0 million
  - Maximum numeric transfer fee: 7.8 million

- Executed SQL to list players with numeric fees:
  SELECT name, "transfer fee"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE "transfer fee" LIKE '% m' AND replace("transfer fee", ' m', '') ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$';
- Result:
  - filip šebo — 1 m
  - daniel cousin — 3.5 m
  - carlos cuéllar — 7.8 m

Step 3: Check for zero-fee (free) transfers
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "transfer fee", COUNT(*) AS player_count
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE "transfer fee" IN ('free', 'n / a')
  GROUP BY "transfer fee";
- Result:
  - free: 2 entries
  - n / a: 28 entries

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset, 7.8 m (Carlos Cuéllar to Aston Villa) is the highest numeric transfer fee, not the lowest. The lowest numeric fee among explicit amounts is 1 m (Filip Šebo), and there are also free transfers (0 fee) recorded.
- Therefore, the claim that Carlos Cuéllar has the lowest transfer fee at 7.8 m is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the discovered dataset: Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season transfers (table public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season).
- “m” denotes millions in the currency used by the dataset.
- Entries labeled “free” are interpreted as zero transfer fee; “n / a” indicates unspecified or not applicable fees and are not treated as numeric amounts.
