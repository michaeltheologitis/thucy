What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public and a single relevant table: olga_govortsova.
- Inspected the table structure and contents. It summarizes Olga Govortsova’s tournament results by year (2007–2011), including Grand Slam tournaments (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open).

Evidence from data
- Table schema (from discovery): public.olga_govortsova(tournament text, "2007" text, "2008" text, "2009" text, "2010" text, "2011" text)

Executed SQL and results
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova;

Returned rows (relevant excerpt):
- australian open: 2007=a, 2008=1r, 2009=1r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r
- french open: 2007=a, 2008=3r, 2009=3r, 2010=2r, 2011=2r
- wimbledon: 2007=2r, 2008=1r, 2009=2r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r
- us open: 2007=2r, 2008=2r, 2009=1r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r

Interpretation
- For Grand Slam events in the years covered (2007–2011), the results are limited to rounds such as 1R, 2R, and 3R. There is no indication of a final (commonly denoted as F or “final”) in any Grand Slam tournament during these years.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data (2007–2011 results), there is no evidence that Olga Govortsova reached a final in a Grand Slam tournament.

Assumptions and scope
- The table appears to capture singles results only; it does not cover doubles/mixed doubles nor years outside 2007–2011. I interpret the claim in the context of the available dataset (singles Grand Slam results for 2007–2011). Within this scope, the claim is not supported by the data.
