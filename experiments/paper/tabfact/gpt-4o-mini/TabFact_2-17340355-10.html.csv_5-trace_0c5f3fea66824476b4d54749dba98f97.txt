Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season game data)

Step 1: Inspect table structure and sample rows
Executed SQL:
1) SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season' 
AND table_schema = 'public';

2) SELECT * 
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
LIMIT 5;

Evidence returned (abridged):
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
- Sample rows include entries such as:
  - game 78 | date april 8 | team new orleans | location attendance new orleans arena 17781 | record 43 - 35
  - game 79 | date april 10 | team memphis | location attendance fedexforum 15908 | record 43 - 36

Step 2: Retrieve attendance for Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans and parse numeric attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", NULLIF(regexp_replace("location attendance", '[^0-9]', '', 'g'), '')::int AS attendance_numeric 
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
WHERE team IN ('golden state', 'memphis', 'new orleans') 
ORDER BY game;

Results:
- Game 78 | Date April 8 | Team New Orleans | Location Attendance: New Orleans Arena 17781 | Attendance Numeric: 17781
- Game 79 | Date April 10 | Team Memphis | Location Attendance: FedExForum 15908 | Attendance Numeric: 15908
- Game 81 | Date April 13 | Team Memphis | Location Attendance: US Airways Center 18422 | Attendance Numeric: 18422
- Game 82 | Date April 15 | Team Golden State | Location Attendance: US Airways Center | Attendance Numeric: NULL (no number provided)

Assessment against the claim:
- New Orleans attendance (17781) ≠ Memphis attendance (15908 and 18422).
- Golden State row has no attendance number recorded in this dataset.
- Therefore, the three teams do not all have the same attendance in the available data.

Conclusion: The evidence contradicts the claim that Golden State, Memphis, and New Orleans all have the same attendance.

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the TabFact.public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season table, where “attendance” refers to the numeric crowd size embedded at the end of the “location attendance” field for each listed game.
- If the claim intended league-wide average or season-long team attendance figures from a different dataset, that is outside the scope of the available data; verification here is strictly based on the provided table.
