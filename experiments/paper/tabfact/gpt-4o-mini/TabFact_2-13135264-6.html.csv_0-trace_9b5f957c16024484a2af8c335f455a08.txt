Conclusion: Supported by the data. In the available dataset (public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season), the highest visitor score is 5, and it was achieved by Detroit as the visiting team.

Evidence and executed SQL

1) Maximum visitor goals in any game
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)::int) AS max_goals FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;

Result:
max_goals = 5

2) All games where the visiting team scored that maximum
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)::int = (SELECT MAX(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)::int) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);

Result:
- Date: January 22 | Visitor: Detroit | Home: Los Angeles | Score: 5 - 4

3) Did Detroit appear as the visiting team among those max-score games?
Executed SQL:
SELECT CASE WHEN EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE visitor = 'detroit' AND SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)::int = 5) THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS detroit_appeared;

Result:
- detroit_appeared = Yes
