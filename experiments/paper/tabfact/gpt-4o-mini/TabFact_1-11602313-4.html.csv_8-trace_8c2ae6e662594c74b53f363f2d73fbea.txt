Claim to verify: “part number lf80537 gf0411 m with release price 90 have fsb 667 mt / s.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema with table: list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors (authoritative for Intel Pentium Dual-Core microprocessors, including part numbers, FSB, and release price (USD)).

Evidence collected:
1) Direct lookup for the specified part number
- Finding: Part number lf80537 gf0411 m corresponds to Pentium Dual-Core T3200 with FSB 667 MT/s and release price listed as “OEM,” not 90.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "model number", fsb, "release price ( usd )", "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE LOWER("part number (s)") = LOWER('lf80537 gf0411 m');
- Result (key fields):
  • model number: Pentium Dual-Core T3200
  • fsb: 667 MT/s
  • release price ( usd ): OEM
  • part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m

2) Check which part(s) actually have release price 90
- Finding: The only row with release price 90 is Pentium Dual-Core T2310 with part number lf80537 ge0201 m and FSB 533 MT/s.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "model number", fsb, "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE "release price ( usd )" = '90';
- Result (key fields):
  • model number: pentium dual - core t2310
  • fsb: 533 mt / s
  • part number (s): lf80537 ge0201 m

3) Broader context: entries containing LF80537 and GF0411M
- Finding: Confirms mapping of part numbers; shows lf80537 gf0411 m is the T3200 (667 MT/s, OEM price). Also shows nearby part numbers for reference.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "fsb", "release price ( usd )", "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE LOWER("part number (s)") LIKE '%lf80537%'
   OR LOWER("part number (s)") LIKE '%gf0411m%';
- Extract of relevant results:
  • pentium dual - core t3200 | slavg (m0) | 667 mt / s | oem | lf80537 gf0411 m
  • pentium dual - core t2310 | slaec (m0) | 533 mt / s | 90  | lf80537 ge0201 m

Assessment:
- The FSB portion of the claim is correct: lf80537 gf0411 m has FSB 667 MT/s.
- The price portion is incorrect: the database lists the release price for lf80537 gf0411 m as “OEM,” not 90 USD. The 90 USD release price corresponds to a different part (lf80537 ge0201 m, T2310) with a different FSB (533 MT/s).

Conclusion: The claim mixes correct FSB data for lf80537 gf0411 m with an incorrect release price. Therefore, the claim is not fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Case-insensitive matching for the part number string.
- “release price ( usd )” is taken as the authoritative launch/release price; values like “OEM” indicate a non-specified OEM pricing rather than a numeric USD amount.
- The claim refers to Intel Pentium Dual-Core mobile processors as represented in the provided table.
