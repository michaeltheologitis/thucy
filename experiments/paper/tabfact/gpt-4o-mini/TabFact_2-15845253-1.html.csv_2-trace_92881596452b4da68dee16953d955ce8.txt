Claim: “2 viral family have a complex virion shape.”

Data source explored
- Database: virology dataset
- Schema: public
- Table: viral_disease(family text, “baltimore group” text, envelopment text, “virion shape” text, “replication site” text)

Evidence from the data
1) Check available virion shape categories
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "virion shape" FROM public.viral_disease;
- Result (distinct values): helical; spherical; complex; helical, bullet shaped; icosahedral

2) List families labeled with virion shape = 'complex'
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'complex';
- Result (families): Herpesviridae; Poxviridae

3) Count distinct families with virion shape = 'complex'
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count 
  FROM public.viral_disease 
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'complex';
- Result: 2

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 2 distinct virus families labeled with a ‘complex’ virion shape: Herpesviridae and Poxviridae. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “There are exactly two virus families with a ‘complex’ virion shape,” according to the available dataset.
- Used exact string matching on the column “virion shape” = 'complex' within the provided table.
