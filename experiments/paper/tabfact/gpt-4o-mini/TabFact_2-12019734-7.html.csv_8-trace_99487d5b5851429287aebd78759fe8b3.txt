Interpretation: You appear to be asking for games where Detroit was the home team and Chicago was the visitor against them, using the available data.

Data source exploration
- Available database: public schema
- Table: my_info_table
- Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)
- Sample inspection shows NHL-style entries like: “new jersey @ chicago” and “detroit @ new jersey.”

Primary check: Detroit home vs Chicago visitor
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(home) = 'detroit' AND LOWER(visitor) = 'chicago' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: No rows returned.

Additional checks
1) Any Detroit home games in this dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(home) = 'detroit' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: No rows returned.

2) Any Chicago visitor games in this dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(visitor) = 'chicago' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: No rows returned.

Context (related matches involving these teams)
- Detroit visiting New Jersey
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
  FROM my_info_table 
  WHERE LOWER(home) = 'new jersey' AND LOWER(visitor) = 'detroit' 
  ORDER BY date ASC;
  - Result: February 24 — visitor: detroit, score: 1 - 4, home: new jersey, record: 12 - 37 - 13

- New Jersey visiting Chicago
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
  FROM my_info_table 
  WHERE LOWER(home) = 'chicago' AND LOWER(visitor) = 'new jersey' 
  ORDER BY date ASC;
  - Result: February 9 — visitor: new jersey, score: 4 - 5, home: chicago, record: 11 - 34 - 12

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset, there are no games where Detroit is the home team and Chicago is the visitor. The data does show Detroit as a visitor to New Jersey and Chicago as a home opponent for New Jersey, but not Chicago visiting Detroit, nor any Detroit home games at all in this table.

Assumptions
- Team names are represented by city/franchise names in lowercase (e.g., “detroit”, “chicago”, “new jersey”).
- The table appears to contain only games involving New Jersey; therefore, absence of “chicago @ detroit” likely reflects dataset scope, not the broader league schedule.
