Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and located a table about airport cargo rankings.
- Reviewed the table schema to identify relevant fields (airport, rank, total cargo).
- Queried the table for the O’Hare entry to retrieve its rank and cargo value.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic (air cargo rankings).

Schema details (public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic)
- rank (bigint)
- airport (text)
- code (iata / icao) (text)
- total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint)
- % change (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
- Purpose: Retrieve the O’Hare row and its rank and total cargo.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT airport, rank, "code (iata / icao)", "total cargo (metric tonnes)"
FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE '%hare%'
   OR airport ILIKE '%O’Hare%'
   OR airport ILIKE '%O''Hare%'

- Result returned:
  - Airport: O'Hare International Airport
  - Rank: 17
  - Code (IATA / ICAO): ORD / KORD
  - Total Cargo (Metric Tonnes): 1,512,186

Conclusion
- The table shows O'Hare International Airport with rank 17 in total cargo. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “the table” refers to public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic.
- “rank 17th on the table in total cargo” means the value in the rank column for O'Hare International Airport equals 17, where the table ranks airports by total cargo (metric tonnes).
