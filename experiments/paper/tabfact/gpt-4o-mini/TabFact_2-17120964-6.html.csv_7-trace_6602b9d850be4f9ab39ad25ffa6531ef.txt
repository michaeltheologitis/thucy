Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema with a single table t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season (Guildford Flames 2008–2009 season).

What I checked
1) Whether any game in this season lists “Wightlink Raiders” (or similar) as the opponent, and the venue marked as Home.
2) Whether there are any games against Wightlink at all and their venue classification.
3) The venue categories used in the table to confirm how “home” is represented.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Locate all games vs Wightlink Raiders
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, competition, result, attendance, "man of the match" 
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%wightlink%';
Result:
- Date: 22nd | Opponent: Wightlink Raiders | Venue: Away | Competition: League / Cup | Result: Lost 5 - 4 | Attendance: 509 | Man of the Match: Stuart Potts

2) Check how many games vs Wightlink by venue
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%wightlink%' 
GROUP BY venue;
Result:
- Away: 1
(No Home entries.)

3) Confirm venue categories used in this dataset
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
GROUP BY venue;
Result:
- Home: 6
- Away: 5

Conclusion
- The only recorded game against Wightlink Raiders in the 2008–09 Guildford Flames dataset is marked as Away, not Home. There is no record of a Home game against Wightlink Raiders in this table.

Assumptions
- “the wightlink raider” refers to the Wightlink Raiders ice hockey team.
- “the home game” refers to a Guildford Flames home fixture within the 2008–09 season captured by the table t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season.
