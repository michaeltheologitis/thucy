Claim to verify: "on 21 august 1943, north melbourne be the away team at glenferrie oval"

Summary of finding: The data shows that on 21 August 1943 the match at Glenferrie Oval was Hawthorn (home) vs South Melbourne (away). North Melbourne were away that day at Princes Park (vs Carlton), not at Glenferrie Oval. No 1943-season record shows North Melbourne as the away team at Glenferrie Oval.

Evidence from database queries:

1) Identify available dates to understand date format
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season ORDER BY date;
Result excerpt: 21 August 1943

2) List all matches on 21 August 1943
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", venue, date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE date ILIKE '%21%August%1943%';
Results:
- Home Team: Hawthorn | Away Team: South Melbourne | Venue: Glenferrie Oval | Date: 21 August 1943
- Home Team: Collingwood | Away Team: Fitzroy | Venue: Victoria Park | Date: 21 August 1943
- Home Team: Carlton | Away Team: North Melbourne | Venue: Princes Park | Date: 21 August 1943
- Home Team: Richmond | Away Team: Melbourne | Venue: Punt Road Oval | Date: 21 August 1943
- Home Team: Footscray | Away Team: Essendon | Venue: Western Oval | Date: 21 August 1943

3) Confirm the away team at Glenferrie Oval on that date
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "away team", venue, date FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Glenferrie%' AND date ILIKE '%21%August%1943%';
Result:
- Home Team: Hawthorn | Away Team: South Melbourne | Venue: Glenferrie Oval | Date: 21 August 1943

4) Check if North Melbourne ever appear as the away team at Glenferrie Oval in 1943
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1943_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Glenferrie%' AND "away team" = 'North Melbourne';
Result: No rows returned

Conclusion: The evidence contradicts the claim. On 21 August 1943, the away team at Glenferrie Oval was South Melbourne, not North Melbourne.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to VFL fixtures and the term "Glenferrie Oval" refers to the venue recorded in the 1943 VFL season dataset.
- The phrasing "be the away team" is interpreted as North Melbourne being listed as the away team in a match at that venue on the specified date.
