Claim interpreted: “The smallest attendance was not at the game against the New England Patriots.” Context grounded in the available data source for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: t_1976_buffalo_bills_season

Schema overview
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence collected
1) Identify the game(s) with the minimum attendance
- Result: Week 11, November 21, 1976, Opponent: San Diego Chargers, Attendance: 36,539
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season)

2) List games vs New England Patriots (case-insensitive match on “patriot”)
- Results:
  - Week 7, October 24, 1976, Opponent: New England Patriots, Attendance: 45,144
  - Week 9, November 7, 1976, Opponent: New England Patriots, Attendance: 61,157
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%patriot%';

3) Distinct opponent values (to confirm naming)
- Result includes: new england patriots (lowercase), among others
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season ORDER BY opponent;

Assessment
- The smallest attendance game (36,539) was against the San Diego Chargers, not the New England Patriots.
- Both Patriots games had higher attendances (45,144 and 61,157) than the overall minimum.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “New England patriot” is interpreted as the NFL team “New England Patriots.”
- “Smallest attendance” refers to the minimum attendance among all rows in t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (i.e., all 1976 Buffalo Bills games in the dataset).
