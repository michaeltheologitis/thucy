Summary conclusion: In the 1973 U.S. Open Golf dataset, the New Zealand player (Bob Charles) is tied for 3rd place (T3), not in last place. The last recorded place in this table is T6, and all players at that position are from the United States.

Data source discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf, representing results from the 1973 U.S. Open Golf tournament (players, country, place, score, to-par).

Schema confirmation
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text).

Evidence 1: Countries represented and counts
- Result: United States: 8 players; New Zealand: 1 player; South Africa: 1 player.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
  GROUP BY country;

Evidence 2: Identify the New Zealand player and their place
- Result: place=t3, player=Bob Charles, country=New Zealand, score=71 + 69 = 140.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, player, country, score 
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf 
  WHERE LOWER(country) IN ('new zealand', 'zealand', 'nz', 'nzl');

Evidence 3: Determine the last place in the table
- Max numeric place (treating T6 as 6) = 6.
- SQL executed to compute max place:
  SELECT MAX(CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER)) AS max_place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf;
- Players at the last place (numeric 6):
  1) Gene Borek, United States, T6, 77 + 65 = 142
  2) Julius Boros, United States, T6, 73 + 69 = 142
  3) Tom Weiskopf, United States, T6, 73 + 69 = 142
  4) Arnold Palmer, United States, T6, 71 + 71 = 142
  5) Lee Trevino, United States, T6, 70 + 72 = 142
- SQL executed to list last-place players:
  SELECT player, country, place, score FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) = 6;

  2) jim colbert, united states, 2, 70 + 68 = 138, - 4
  3) bob charles, new zealand, t3, 71 + 69 = 140, - 2
  4) jack nicklaus, united states, t3, 71 + 69 = 140, - 2
  5) johnny miller, united states, t3, 71 + 69 = 140, - 2
  6) arnold palmer, united states, t6, 71 + 71 = 142, e
  7) gene borek, united states, t6, 77 + 65 = 142, e
  8) julius boros, united states, t6, 73 + 69 = 142, e
  9) lee trevino, united states, t6, 70 + 72 = 142, e
  10) tom weiskopf, united states, t6, 73 + 69 = 142, e
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par" 
  FROM t_1973_u_s_open_golf 
  ORDER BY CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(place, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER), player;

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the New Zealand player (Bob Charles) at T3, while the last place recorded (numeric 6) is occupied exclusively by players from the United States. Therefore, the claim that the player from New Zealand is in last place is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "The player from New Zealand" refers to any row where the country field indicates New Zealand (case-insensitive match in this dataset, which stores values in lowercase).
- "Last place" is interpreted as the highest numeric finishing position found in the place column after removing non-digit characters (e.g., T6 treated as 6).
- Verification is limited to the rows present in the provided 1973 U.S. Open Golf dataset table.
