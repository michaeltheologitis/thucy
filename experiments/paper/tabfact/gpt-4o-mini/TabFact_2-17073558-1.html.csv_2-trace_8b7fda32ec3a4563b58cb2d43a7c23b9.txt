Claim to verify: “the average service be less than 7, when year be greater than 2003, when industry be less than 1465, and when regional gva be greater than 9432.”

Data source discovery
- Available DB: PostgreSQL with a single table public.my_info_table.

Schema details (public.my_info_table)
- Columns: year (bigint), regional gva (bigint), agriculture (bigint), industry (bigint), services (bigint)
- No primary keys, constraints, or indexes.

Evidence 1: Direct test of the claim’s filter and average
- Purpose: Compute AVG(services) where year > 2003 AND industry < 1465 AND "regional gva" > 9432.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT AVG(services) AS average_services, COUNT(*) AS count_matching_rows, MIN(services) AS min_services, MAX(services) AS max_services 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE year > 2003 AND industry < 1465 AND "regional gva" > 9432;
- Result: average_services = null, count_matching_rows = 0, min_services = null, max_services = null.
- Interpretation: No rows satisfy the combined conditions; the average is undefined, so it cannot be less than 7.

Evidence 2: Diagnostics to understand why no rows match
- Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_row_count FROM my_info_table;
Result: 5

2) SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_year_gt_2003 FROM my_info_table WHERE year > 2003;
Result: 2

3) SQL:
SELECT MAX("regional gva") AS max_regional_gva FROM my_info_table;
Result: 9432

4) SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_regional_gva_gt_9432 FROM my_info_table WHERE "regional gva" > 9432;
Result: 0

5) SQL:
SELECT MIN(industry) AS min_industry FROM my_info_table;
Result: 1110

6) SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_industry_lt_1465 FROM my_info_table WHERE industry < 1465;
Result: 3

- Interpretation: Although there are rows with year > 2003 (2 rows) and industry < 1465 (3 rows), there are zero rows with regional gva > 9432 because the maximum regional gva equals 9432. Hence, the combined filter yields zero rows, making the average of services under those conditions undefined.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no records that satisfy all the stated conditions simultaneously. Therefore, the average of services under those conditions cannot be computed and is not demonstrably less than 7.

Assumptions
- “average service” is interpreted as AVG(services) over rows meeting the specified conditions.
- “regional gva” refers to the column named exactly regional gva in public.my_info_table.
- Inequalities are interpreted strictly as > and < as stated, not ≥ or ≤.
- Verification is constrained to the available table public.my_info_table, treated as authoritative per instructions.
