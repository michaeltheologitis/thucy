Claim to verify: "all the tournament list have an average of 2.5 event"

Interpretation: I interpret this as asserting that the average number of events per tournament in the available tournament list is 2.5. I treat the “tournament list” as the tournaments recorded in the available database table and “events” as the events count for each tournament.

Data source discovery
- Connected PostgreSQL database with schema public
- Available table: public.brian_watts
  - Columns (per schema inspection): tournament (text), wins (bigint), top - 5 (bigint), top - 25 (bigint), events (bigint), cuts made (bigint)

Evidence from data (executed SQL and returned rows)
1) Listing all tournaments and events (first 20 rows)
SQL:
SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts LIMIT 20;
Result:
- Masters Tournament | 2
- US Open | 2
- The Open Championship | 7
- PGA Championship | 6
- Totals | 17

2) Listing all tournaments that are not the summary row ‘Totals’
SQL:
SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts WHERE tournament <> 'Totals';
Result:
- masters tournament | 2
- us open | 2
- the open championship | 7
- pga championship | 6

Analysis
- The tournament list (excluding the ‘Totals’ summary row) contains 4 tournaments with events: 2, 2, 7, 6.
- Sum of events across these tournaments = 2 + 2 + 7 + 6 = 17.
- Number of tournaments = 4.
- Average events per tournament = 17 / 4 = 4.25.

Conclusion
- The claimed average of 2.5 events is not supported by the data. The data shows an average of 4.25 events per tournament (excluding the ‘Totals’ summary row).

Assumptions
- “tournament list” refers to the set of tournaments recorded in public.brian_watts.
- The row labeled ‘Totals’ is a summary row and is excluded when computing the per-tournament average.
- “event” refers to the ‘events’ column values for each tournament entry.
