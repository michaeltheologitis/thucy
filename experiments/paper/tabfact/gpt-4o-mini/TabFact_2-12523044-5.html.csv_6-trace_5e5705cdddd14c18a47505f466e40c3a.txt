Claim: “Pádraig Harrington and Graeme McDowell are both from Northern Ireland.”

Findings from available data
- The database contains a table (public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf) with golfer names and their country.
- Querying for the two golfers shows:
  - Pádraig Harrington — Country: Ireland (not Northern Ireland)
  - Graeme McDowell — Country: Northern Ireland

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results)
- SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%harrington%' OR player ILIKE '%mcdowell%'
- Result excerpt:
  - Pádraig Harrington | Ireland
  - Graeme McDowell | Northern Ireland

Conclusion
- Because the data lists Pádraig Harrington’s country as Ireland (not Northern Ireland) and Graeme McDowell’s as Northern Ireland, the claim that both are from Northern Ireland is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The “country” field reflects the golfer’s represented country/national affiliation in the tournament, which we treat as the authoritative indicator of where they are “from” for the purpose of this verification.
