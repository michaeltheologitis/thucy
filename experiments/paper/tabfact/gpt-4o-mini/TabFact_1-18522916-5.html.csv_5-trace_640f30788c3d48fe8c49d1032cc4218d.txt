Claim to verify: “Mauricio Cienfuegos [was] sacked on 25 August 2008.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: El Salvador Primera División Apertura 2008
- Relevant table: primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
- Columns include: team, outgoing manager, manner of departure, date of vacancy, replaced by, date of appointment, position in table

Evidence 1: Records for Mauricio Cienfuegos
- Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "outgoing manager", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "replaced by", "date of appointment" 
FROM primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 
WHERE LOWER("outgoing manager") = 'mauricio cienfuegos';
- Result:
  - Team: Nejapa
  - Outgoing Manager: Mauricio Cienfuegos
  - Manner of Departure: Mutual consent
  - Date of Vacancy: 14 August 2008
  - Replaced By: Daniel Uberti
  - Date of Appointment (replacement): 5 September 2008

Evidence 2: Any sacking on 25 August 2008
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "team", "outgoing manager", "manner of departure" 
FROM primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 
WHERE "date of vacancy" = '25 august 2008';
- Result:
  - Team: Firpo
  - Outgoing Manager: Gerardo Reinoso
  - Manner of Departure: sacked

Assessment
- The data shows Mauricio Cienfuegos left Nejapa on 14 August 2008 by mutual consent, not on 25 August 2008 and not as a sacking.
- On 25 August 2008, a different manager (Gerardo Reinoso of Firpo) was sacked.
- Therefore, the claim that Mauricio Cienfuegos was sacked on 25 August 2008 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Sacked” corresponds to the “manner of departure” field value “sacked.”
- The claim concerns managerial changes within the Apertura 2008 season of El Salvador’s Primera División, which the provided dataset covers.
- Name matching is case-insensitive and refers to the Salvadoran former player/coach Mauricio Cienfuegos.
