Claim to verify: In the election with Goodloe Byron as the incumbent politician, Goodloe Byron (D) won with 73.7% of the vote vs Elton Rwampler (R).

Data source explored: A PostgreSQL database with table public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 containing U.S. House election results for 1974 (columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates).

Evidence collected:
1) Locate the row for incumbent “Byron”
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Byron%';
Result:
- District: Maryland 6
- Incumbent: Goodloe Byron
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: 1970
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Goodloe Byron (D) 73.7%, Elton R. Wampler (R) 26.3%

2) Retrieve the record specifically for incumbent “Goodloe Byron”
Executed SQL:

- District: Maryland 6
- Incumbent: Goodloe Byron
- Party: Democratic
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Goodloe Byron (D) 73.7%, Elton R. Wampler (R) 26.3%

Assessment:

- The claim’s figures and outcome match the data exactly. The only discrepancy is a minor misspelling of the opponent’s name: the correct name is Elton R. Wampler (not “Rwampler”).

Conclusion: The core claim is accurate; Goodloe Byron (D) won with 73.7% against Elton R. Wampler (R).

Assumptions made:
