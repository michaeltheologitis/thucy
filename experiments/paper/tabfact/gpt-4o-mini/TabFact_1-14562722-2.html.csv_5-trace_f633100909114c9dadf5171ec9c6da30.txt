Claim to verify: “there be 4 episode in region 4 on march 13 , 2008.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows a record with Region 4 date “march 13 , 2008” and episodes = 4. The claim is supported by the evidence below.

Data source discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with table public.my_info_table.

Schema context
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text)
  - No primary/foreign keys

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Table size (context only)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: 5 rows

2) Region 4 values containing year 2008 (to identify relevant dates)
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" LIKE '%2008%' LIMIT 20;
- Result examples: "june 19 , 2008"; "march 13 , 2008"

3) Match Region 4 entries corresponding to March 13, 2008 and check episode count
- SQL: SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 4" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "region 4" ~* 'March[ ]*,?[ ]*13[ ]*,?[ ]*2008';
- Result:
  - volume: 3; discs: 1; episodes: 4; region 4: "march 13 , 2008"

Assessment
- The record matching Region 4 date “march 13 , 2008” has episodes = 4. This directly supports the claim that there are 4 episodes in Region 4 on that date.

Assumptions
- “region 4” in the claim refers to the "region 4" text column in public.my_info_table.
- The phrase “on march 13 , 2008” refers to the date embedded in the "region 4" column’s text value.
- “4 episode” means the episodes column equals 4 for the matching record.
