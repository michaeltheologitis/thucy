Claim to verify: More viewers in the US watched episode 4 of Dexter (season 3) than watched episode 2.

Data source discovery:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.dexter_season_3.
- Key columns: "no in season" (episode number within the season), "title", and "us viewers (millions)" (viewership in millions, stored as text).

Schema reference (as discovered):
- Columns: "no in series" bigint, "no in season" bigint, "title" text, "directed by" text, "written by" text, "original air date" text, "us viewers (millions)" text.

Evidence queries and results:
1) Context check (first 10 rows):
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.dexter_season_3 LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt relevant to the claim:
- no in season = 2, title = finding freebo, us viewers (millions) = 0.79
- no in season = 4, title = all in the family, us viewers (millions) = 0.86

2) Direct retrieval for episodes 2 and 4:
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in season", "title", "us viewers (millions)"
FROM public.dexter_season_3
WHERE "no in season" IN (2, 4);
Returned values:
- Episode 2 (finding freebo): 0.79 million
- Episode 4 (all in the family): 0.86 million

Analysis:
- Episode 4 viewership (0.86M) is greater than Episode 2 viewership (0.79M).
- Difference: 0.07 million viewers (approximately 70,000 more viewers for episode 4).

Conclusion:
The data shows episode 4 had higher US viewership than episode 2 for Dexter season 3.

Assumptions:
- “US viewers” refers to the column "us viewers (millions)" in public.dexter_season_3.
- “Episode 2/4” refers to the season episode numbering in the column "no in season".
