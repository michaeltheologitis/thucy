Claim checked: “beausejour have a lead of aaron watson.” Interpreted as: In the dataset, the team from Beausejour has a lead whose name is Aaron Watson.

Findings grounded in data
1) Beausejour’s lead
- Result: The Beausejour team’s lead is Tyler Forrest, not Aaron Watson.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city ILIKE 'beausejour';
- Returned row:
  Skip: Jason Gunnlaugson; Third / Vice Skip: Justin Richter; Second: Braden Zawada; Lead: Tyler Forrest.

2) Existence of a lead named Aaron Watson (for context)
- Result: Aaron Watson is listed as the lead for the Richmond team.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT city, skip, "third / vice skip" AS third, second, lead FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE lead ILIKE 'aaron watson';
- Returned row:
  City: Richmond; Skip: Greg McAulay; Third (Vice Skip): Ken Maskiewich; Second: Deane Horning; Lead: Aaron Watson.

Conclusion
- The data shows Beausejour’s lead is Tyler Forrest. Aaron Watson appears as a lead, but for Richmond, not Beausejour. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “lead” refers to the curling position listed in the table.
- “beausejour” refers to the City field value in the available dataset (Canadian curling trials).
