Claim interpreted: The user claims that “Dundee West have higher swing to gain point than Western Isle(s).” I interpret “swing to gain point” as the “swing to gain” percentage points recorded in the Scottish Parliament General Election 2007 dataset for the constituencies “dundee west” and “western isles.”

Data source consulted: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 (authoritative per available environment).

Step 1 — Confirm constituency entries
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT constituency FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE constituency ILIKE '%Dundee%' OR constituency ILIKE '%Western%';
Result (relevant rows):
- dundee west
- western isles

Step 2 — Retrieve “swing to gain” values for both constituencies
Executed SQL:
SELECT constituency, "swing to gain" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE lower(constituency) IN ('dundee west', 'western isles');
Results:
- Dundee West: swing to gain = 2.13
- Western Isles: swing to gain = 2.91

Analysis:
- Dundee West’s swing to gain (2.13) is lower than Western Isles’ (2.91).
- Therefore, Dundee West does not have a higher swing-to-gain than Western Isles; it is lower.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- “Swing to gain point” is interpreted as the “swing to gain” metric provided in the Scottish Parliament General Election 2007 dataset.
- The comparison refers to those exact constituency entries in this dataset and timeframe, not to a different election or calculation method.
