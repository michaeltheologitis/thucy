Summary
Claim: “the chicago bull only play the boston celtic at the boston garden during the 1984 - 85 season.”
Conclusion: The available season dataset shows exactly one Celtics–Bulls game in 1984–85, and it was at Boston Garden. No games vs the Bulls are recorded at any other venue. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) List all 1984–85 games vs the Bulls and their venues
SQL: SELECT game, date, opponent, score, location, record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Bulls%' ORDER BY date ASC;
Result excerpt:
- Date: 1985-01-09 (Wed Jan 9), Opponent: Chicago Bulls, Score: 111-108, Location: Boston Garden, Record: 30-6
(No additional rows returned for the Bulls.)

2) Count of 1984–85 games vs the Bulls
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_vs_bulls FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Bulls%';
Result: games_vs_bulls = 1

3) Locations for all 1984–85 games vs the Bulls
SQL: SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Bulls%' GROUP BY location ORDER BY games DESC;
Result:
- Boston Garden: 1

Interpretation
- The dataset records one Celtics–Bulls matchup in 1984–85, played at Boston Garden, with no corresponding game at any other venue. This supports the claim that the Bulls only played the Celtics at Boston Garden during that season (as per the available data).

Assumptions
- The table public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season is a complete game log for the Boston Celtics’ 1984–85 season (regular season and any recorded postseason games).
- “Only play … at the Boston Garden” is interpreted as: all Celtics–Bulls meetings recorded for 1984–85 were at Boston Garden (i.e., none at Chicago or neutral sites).
