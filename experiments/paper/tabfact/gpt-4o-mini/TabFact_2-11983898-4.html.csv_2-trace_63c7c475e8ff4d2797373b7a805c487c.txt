What I checked
- Data source discovery shows a PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing a single table: fabio_fognini. This appears to catalog Fabio Fognini’s finals, including date, tournament, opponent, outcome, and score.
- I inspected the schema and then queried for finals on April 29, 2012.

Evidence from the data
- Result returned:
  - Date: 29 April 2012
  - Tournament: BRD Năstase Țiriac Trophy, Bucharest, Romania
  - Surface: Clay
  - Opponent in the final: Gilles Simon
  - Outcome: Runner-up
  - Score in the final: 4 - 6, 3 - 6

Executed SQL
SELECT date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", outcome, "score in the final"
FROM fabio_fognini
WHERE date::date = '2012-04-29';

Conclusion
- The database records that on April 29, 2012, in the final Fognini’s score was 4 - 6, 3 - 6. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to Fabio Fognini’s final on that date, as the available data source specifically covers Fabio Fognini’s finals.
