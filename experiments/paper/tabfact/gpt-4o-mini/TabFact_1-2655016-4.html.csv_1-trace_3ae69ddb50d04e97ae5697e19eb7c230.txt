Summary conclusion
- Claim: 3 episode have title begin with the letter t
- Finding: Supported by the data in the public.list_of_all_that_episodes table.

What data source I used
- Database: PostgreSQL (schema: public)
- Table: list_of_all_that_episodes
- Relevant column: "episode title" (text)

How I verified
1) Discovered available data sources
- Result: Found a single table, public.list_of_all_that_episodes.

2) Inspected the table schema
- Columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "nick prod" (bigint)
- No primary keys or additional constraints noted.

3) Queried the data to count titles beginning with the letter t (case-insensitive)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count, ARRAY_AGG("episode title") AS titles
  FROM list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("episode title") LIKE 't%';
- Result: episode_count = 3
- Matching titles returned:
  - tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j
  - tyra banks / blackstreet
  - tony! toni! tone!

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 3 episodes with titles that begin with the letter t (case-insensitive), which matches the claim.

Assumptions
- "Begin with the letter t" is interpreted case-insensitively (T or t).
- The term "episode" refers to rows in public.list_of_all_that_episodes, and the relevant field for title is the "episode title" column.
