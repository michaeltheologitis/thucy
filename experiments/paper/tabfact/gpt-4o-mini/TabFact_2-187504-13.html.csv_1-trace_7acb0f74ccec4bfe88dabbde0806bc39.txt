What I checked
- Available data sources discovery indicates one authoritative table: public.t_1988_winter_olympics containing medal standings for the 1988 Winter Olympics (rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total).

Evidence pulled from the database
- Query executed:
  SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE nation IN ('sweden (swe)', 'austria (aut)');

- Result returned by the tool:
  • Sweden — Rank: 5; Gold: 4; Silver: 0; Bronze: 2; Total: 6
  • Austria — Rank: 6; Gold: 3; Silver: 5; Bronze: 2; Total: 10

Assessment
- Official medal table ranking (gold-first) for the 1988 Winter Olympics: Sweden ranked higher than Austria (5 vs 6).
- Total medal count comparison: Austria had more total medals than Sweden (10 vs 6). Therefore, if ranking by total medals, Austria would place higher than Sweden.

Conclusion based on available data
- The statement that Sweden placed higher than Austria “in the total medal count” for the 1988 Olympics is contradicted by the data for the 1988 Winter Games: Austria led in total medals.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “1988 Olympics” as the 1988 Winter Olympics because the available authoritative dataset covers only the Winter Games.
- Interpreted “total medal count” literally as ranking by the total number of medals, not the official gold-first ranking.
