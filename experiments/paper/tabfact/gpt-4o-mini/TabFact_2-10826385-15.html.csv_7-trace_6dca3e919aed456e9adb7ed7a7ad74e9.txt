Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and its structure.
- Queried the dataset for the specific 1972 VFL round that contains both fixtures: Fitzroy vs North Melbourne and Essendon vs Richmond.
- Compared the recorded crowds for those games to evaluate the claim.

Available data sources
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1972_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows (confirms both relevant matches occur on the same date in this dataset):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Returned (excerpt):
- fitzroy vs north melbourne — venue: junction oval — crowd: 7007 — date: 15 july 1972
- essendon vs richmond — venue: windy hill — crowd: 22251 — date: 15 july 1972

2) Retrieve Fitzroy vs North Melbourne match(es):
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
WHERE ("home team" = 'fitzroy' AND "away team" = 'north melbourne')
   OR ("home team" = 'north melbourne' AND "away team" = 'fitzroy')
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- 15 july 1972 | home: fitzroy | away: north melbourne | venue: junction oval | crowd: 7007

3) Retrieve Essendon vs Richmond match(es):
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd 
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season 
WHERE ("home team" = 'essendon' AND "away team" = 'richmond') 
   OR ("home team" = 'richmond' AND "away team" = 'essendon') 
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- 15 july 1972 | home: essendon | away: richmond | venue: windy hill | crowd: 22251

4) Count of Essendon–Richmond rows present (to confirm dataset scope for this pairing):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE ("home team", "away team") IN (('essendon', 'richmond'), ('richmond', 'essendon'));
Result:
- 1

Findings
- On 15 July 1972 (the round represented in the accessible table), the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne match had a recorded crowd of 7,007.
- On the same date, the Essendon vs Richmond match had a recorded crowd of 22,251.
- Therefore, for this round/date, fewer people attended Fitzroy vs North Melbourne than Essendon vs Richmond.

Conclusion
- The claim that "more attend the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game than the Essendon vs Richmond game" is contradicted by the available data for 15 July 1972.

Assumptions
- The dataset available contains the relevant round of the 1972 VFL season (all sample rows are dated 15 July 1972). I interpret the user’s claim as referring to the matches on that date in the dataset, since no other date/context was provided. Team names in the table are stored in lowercase, so SQL comparisons used lowercase to match values exactly.
