Scope and data sources
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database (public schema) with one relevant table: t_1970_isle_of_man_tt, which holds Isle of Man TT 1970 results.
- Table schema (t_1970_isle_of_man_tt): rank (bigint), rider (text), team (text), speed (text), time (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Direct test of the full claim (rider = Brian Finch, team contains Suzuki, rank > 3)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rider, team, time FROM public.t_1970_isle_of_man_tt WHERE rider ILIKE 'Brian Finch%' AND team ILIKE 'Suzuki%' AND rank > 3;
Result: no rows returned.

2) Confirm the entry for rider Brian Finch (regardless of team)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rider, team, time FROM public.t_1970_isle_of_man_tt WHERE LOWER(rider) = LOWER('Brian Finch');
Result:
- Rank: 7, Rider: brian finch, Team: velocette, Time: 2:14.59.0

3) Broader check for any rider containing the surname Finch
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rider, team, time FROM public.t_1970_isle_of_man_tt WHERE rider ILIKE '%Finch%';
Result:
- Rank: 7, Rider: Brian Finch, Team: Velocette, Time: 2:14.59.0

4) Identify all entries for team containing Suzuki
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rider, team, time FROM public.t_1970_isle_of_man_tt WHERE team ILIKE '%Suzuki%';
Results:
- Rank: 1, Rider: frank whiteway, Team: suzuki, Time: 2:05.52.0
- Rank: 6, Rider: jwade, Team: suzuki, Time: 2:12.42.0

5) Check if any Suzuki entry has time exactly 2:14.59.0
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, rider, team, time FROM public.t_1970_isle_of_man_tt WHERE team ILIKE '%Suzuki%' AND time = '2:14.59.0';
Result: no rows returned.

Conclusion
- There is no record for a rider named Brian Finch on team Suzuki with rank greater than 3 and time 2:14.59.0.
- The time 2:14.59.0 does exist for Brian Finch, but his team is Velocette and his rank is 7 (>3). Suzuki entries have different riders and times.

Assumptions
- “team suzuki” was interpreted as any team name containing the substring “Suzuki” (case-insensitive).
- The claim pertains to the 1970 Isle of Man TT results contained in the t_1970_isle_of_man_tt table.
- Time matching required an exact text match to '2:14.59.0'.
