Summary:
- Using the available PostgreSQL data for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season (table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season), I verified how many games occurred in November and December.

Data exploration (date format and months present):
- Evidence query (lists all weeks and dates):
  SQL: SELECT week, date FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
- Result excerpt shows months: September, October, November, December, with these November/December dates:
  • November: november 7 , 1976; november 15 , 1976; november 21 , 1976; november 25 , 1976
  • December: december 5 , 1976; december 12 , 1976

Verification counts:
- November games count:
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS november_games FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'november%';
  Result: 4

- December games count:
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS december_games FROM t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'december%';
  Result: 2

Assessment of the claim:
- If the claim means “there are 2 games in November and December (combined),” the data shows 6 total (4 in November + 2 in December), so that interpretation is incorrect.
- If the claim means “there are 2 games in November and 2 in December,” the data shows 4 in November and 2 in December, so this is only half-correct.

Conclusion: The data shows 4 games in November and 2 games in December for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season. Therefore, the statement that there are 2 games in “November December” is not supported overall.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the user’s phrase “the month of november december” as referring to the months of November and December in the only available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season).
