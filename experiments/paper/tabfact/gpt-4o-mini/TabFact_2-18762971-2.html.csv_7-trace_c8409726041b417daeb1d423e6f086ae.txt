Scope and data sources
- Discovered available data: a single authoritative table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season containing Sheffield Wednesday FC match records for the 2000–2001 season with columns (date, opponent, venue, result, attendance).

Operational definition
- Interpreted “games where no goal be score by either side” as matches with result exactly “0 - 0”.

Evidence from data
1) Retrieve all 0-0 matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue 
FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season 
WHERE result = '0 - 0'
Result (3 matches):
- 30 December 2000 — Huddersfield Town — Away (a)
- 7 March 2001 — Portsmouth — Home (h)
- 6 May 2001 — Crewe Alexandra — Home (h)

2) Count 0-0 matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE result = '0 - 0';
Result: 3

Conclusion
- The data shows 3 matches ended 0-0, not 4. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Sheffield Wednesday FC 2000–2001 season (the only available dataset).
- “No goal be score by either side” means a final score of 0 - 0.
