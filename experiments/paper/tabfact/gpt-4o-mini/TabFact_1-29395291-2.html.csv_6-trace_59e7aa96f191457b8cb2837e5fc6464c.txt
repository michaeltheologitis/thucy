Claim to verify: “the maximum number of 2006 subscriber for glo mobile be 11000 at morocco.”

Data discovery and context
- Available database schemas and tables (from information_schema):
  SQL:
  SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
- Relevant table and columns:
  SQL:
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'mobile_telephony_in_africa';
  Resulting relevant columns:
  - provider (text)
  - country (text)
  - subscribers (2005) (thousands) (numeric)
  - subscribers (2006) (thousands) (numeric)
  - growth % (numeric)

Evidence 1: Glo Mobile’s 2006 subscribers and location
- Query Glo-related rows and compute maxima:
  SQL:
  SELECT "provider", "country", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE "provider" ILIKE '%Glo%';

  SQL:
  SELECT "country", MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)") AS max_subscribers
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE "provider" ILIKE '%Glo%'
  GROUP BY "country";

  SQL (top Glo row by 2006 subscribers):
  SELECT "provider", "country", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE "provider" ILIKE '%Glo%'
    AND "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" DESC
  LIMIT 1;

Findings:
- Provider: Glo Mobile; Country: Nigeria; Subscribers (2006): 11,000 (thousands).
- The maximum 2006 value for Glo Mobile corresponds to Nigeria, not Morocco.

Evidence 2: Morocco records in 2006
- Query Morocco-related rows:
  SQL:
  SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE country ILIKE '%Moroc%';

  SQL (maximum 2006 subscribers in Morocco):
  SELECT MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)")
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE country ILIKE '%Moroc%';

Findings:
- Country: Morocco; Provider: maroc; Subscribers (2006): 10,707 (thousands).
- Maximum in Morocco for 2006: 10,707 (thousands). No Glo Mobile record appears for Morocco.

Evidence 3: Records with exactly 11,000 (thousands) in 2006
- Query exact 2006 value 11,000:
  SQL:
  SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" = 11000;

Findings:
- Provider: Glo Mobile; Country: Nigeria. No Morocco match at this value.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that Glo Mobile’s 2006 subscribers of 11,000 (thousands) are associated with Nigeria, not Morocco. Morocco’s 2006 maximum (10,707 thousands) is for a different provider (“maroc”), and there is no evidence of Glo Mobile in Morocco in this data. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as: “The maximum number of subscribers in 2006 for Glo Mobile is 11,000 (thousands) and this occurs in Morocco.”
- Treated values under “subscribers (2006) (thousands)” as counts in thousands (per column label).
