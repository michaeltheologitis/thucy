Scope and data sources explored:
- Discovered an NHL-related dataset containing a table for the Minnesota Wild’s 2007–08 season: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season (columns: date text, visitor text, score text, home text, decision text, attendance bigint, record text).

Step 1: Inspect date and score formats
- Purpose: Confirm how dates and scores are stored to query correctly.
- Executed SQL: SELECT date, score FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 5;
- Observation: Dates appear as textual month/day (e.g., "february 10"), and scores are stored as text in the format "X - Y".

Step 2: Retrieve game entries for February 10 and February 24
- Executed SQL: SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE LOWER(date) IN ('february 10', 'february 24');
- Results:
  - Date: February 10; Visitor: Minnesota; Score: 2 - 1; Home: St Louis; Decision: Harding
  - Date: February 24; Visitor: Calgary; Score: 2 - 1; Home: Minnesota; Decision: Backstrom

Conclusion:
- On both February 10 and February 24 during the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the recorded score is 2 - 1. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The dates "February 10" and "February 24" refer to the entries in this season table (which stores dates as text without explicit year) and correspond to 2008 within the 2007–08 season.
- The "score" field represents the final score of each game.
