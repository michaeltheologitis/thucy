Claim interpreted: The statement implies that the only invitational event occurred in the 2002 season in Los Angeles.

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema with one table: tsuyoshi_fujita
- Columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)

Step 1: Inspect distinct combinations of season, location, and event type
Result highlights show one invitational entry in Los Angeles, but in season 2005 (not 2002):
- 2005 | los angeles | invitational
- 2005 | los angeles | pro tour
- Multiple 2002-related seasons (formatted as 2002 - 03) exist, but they are Grand Prix events in Utsunomiya, Hiroshima, and Bangkok.
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season, location, "event type" FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita;

Step 2: Count invitational events and list their season and location
Result: 1 row with event type 'invitational'; Season: 2005, Location: Los Angeles.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, season, location 
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita 
WHERE LOWER("event type") = 'invitational' 
GROUP BY season, location;

Step 3: List all events in Los Angeles
Result: Two events in Los Angeles, both in 2005; one is invitational, one is pro tour.
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "event type"
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE LOWER(location) = 'los angeles';

Step 4: Check events in seasons containing 2002
Result: Events in the 2002 - 03 season are Grand Prix in Utsunomiya, Hiroshima, and Bangkok; none in Los Angeles and none are invitational.
Executed SQL:
SELECT location, "event type"
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE season LIKE '%2002%';

Conclusion
- The only invitational event in the dataset occurred in Los Angeles, but during the 2005 season, not in 2002. There are no invitational events in the 2002 - 03 season, and no Los Angeles events in that season.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as asserting that the unique invitational event took place in the 2002 season in Los Angeles. Season formatting in the data (e.g., '2002 - 03') was treated as the 2002 season span. Comparisons for text fields were done case-insensitively.
