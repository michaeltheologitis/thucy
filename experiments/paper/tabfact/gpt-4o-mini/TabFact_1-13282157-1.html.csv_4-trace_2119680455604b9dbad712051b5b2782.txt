Summary conclusion: The claim “99012 be the lowest reset point where the event be 56” is not supported by the data. In the available dataset, there are no rows with events = 56, and the observed reset points range from 96,500 to 100,000; 99,012 does not appear at all.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public
- Relevant table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
- Columns: Unnamed: 0 (bigint), player (text), country (text), points (bigint), events (bigint), reset points (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check which event counts exist
- Result: 13, 18, 19, 21, 23, 25 (no value 56)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT events FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY events ASC;

2) Verify whether any rows exist with events = 56 and, if so, the minimum reset points
- Result: count = 0; min_reset_points = null (no rows with events = 56)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, MIN("reset points") AS min_reset_points 
  FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs 
  WHERE events = 56;

3) Inspect distinct reset point values to see if 99,012 appears
- Result (ascending distinct values): 96,500; 96,750; 97,000; 97,250; 97,500; 98,000; 98,500; 99,000; 100,000 (99,012 is not present)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "reset points" FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs ORDER BY "reset points" ASC;

4) Confirm overall min and max reset points
- Result: Minimum = 96,500; Maximum = 100,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN("reset points") AS min_reset_points FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs;
  SELECT MAX("reset points") AS max_reset_points FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs;

Assessment
- There are no records with events = 56 in this dataset, so the condition “where the event be 56” is unmet.
- The value 99,012 does not occur as a reset point in the dataset, and the lowest reset point overall is 96,500, not 99,012.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “event be 56” to mean rows where the column events equals 56.
- Interpreted “lowest reset point” as the minimum value in the column "reset points" among rows satisfying the event condition.
