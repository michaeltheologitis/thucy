Claim interpreted: The user asserts that New Jersey is the visiting team when they play Vancouver as the home team (i.e., there exists at least one game with visitor = New Jersey and home = Vancouver in the available dataset).

Data source discovery
- Available database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Available table: my_info_table with columns (date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text).

Evidence collected
1) Search for games with Vancouver as home and New Jersey as visitor (pattern match to allow naming variants):
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE home ILIKE '%Vancouver%' 
AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Count such games:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE home ILIKE '%Vancouver%' 
AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%';
Result: game_count = 0.

3) Check naming variants present for these teams:
- Distinct home names including Vancouver or New Jersey:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT home AS team_name FROM my_info_table WHERE home ILIKE '%Vancouver%' OR home ILIKE '%New Jersey%';
Result: Vancouver.
- Distinct visitor names including Vancouver or New Jersey:
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT visitor AS team_name FROM my_info_table WHERE visitor ILIKE '%Vancouver%' OR visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%';
Result: New Jersey.
Interpretation: The dataset uses the plain strings "Vancouver" and "New Jersey" when these teams appear, so the pattern search in (1) should have captured any such head-to-head game with Vancouver home and New Jersey visiting.

4) Directly test for any head-to-head games (either home/visitor orientation):
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record FROM my_info_table WHERE (visitor = 'Vancouver' AND home = 'New Jersey') OR (visitor = 'New Jersey' AND home = 'Vancouver');
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no games where Vancouver is the home team and New Jersey is the visiting team. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- "New Jersey" refers to the New Jersey Devils and "Vancouver" refers to the Vancouver Canucks; the table stores team names as text without abbreviations or nicknames beyond these strings, consistent with the distinct-name queries above.
- The verification is limited to the authoritative dataset provided (my_info_table). If a game exists outside this dataset, it is out of scope for this verification.
