Claim to verify: “3 of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have 2 different uniform numbers.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks

Schema (relevant columns):
- quarterback (text)
- uniform no (s) (text)
- games started (bigint)
- wins (bigint)
- losses (bigint)
- ties (bigint)
- winning pct (double precision)

Evidence 1: Sample of quarterbacks and their uniform numbers
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, "uniform no (s)"
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
LIMIT 20;

Result excerpt (showing examples with multiple numbers):
- graham , otto | 60 , 14
- ninowski , jim | 15 , 11
(...others in sample have single numbers...)

Evidence 2: Robust parsing to find all QBs with more than one number and how many
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, COUNT(DISTINCT number) AS distinct_number_count, ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT number ORDER BY number) AS sorted_numbers
FROM (
    SELECT quarterback,
           REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_ARRAY("uniform no (s)", '[^0-9]+') AS numbers
    FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
) AS qb_numbers
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(numbers) AS number
GROUP BY quarterback
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT number) > 1;

Results:
- Graham, Otto | distinct_number_count = 2 | sorted_numbers = [14, 60]
- Ninowski, Jim | distinct_number_count = 2 | sorted_numbers = [11, 15]
- Ratterman, George | distinct_number_count = 2 | sorted_numbers = [12, 16]

Evidence 3: Robust parsing to list QBs who have exactly two distinct numbers (names and numbers)
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, STRING_AGG(DISTINCT uniform_no, ',' ORDER BY uniform_no) AS uniform_numbers
FROM (
    SELECT quarterback, UNNEST(REGEXP_SPLIT_TO_ARRAY("uniform no (s)", '[^0-9]+')) AS uniform_no
    FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
    WHERE "uniform no (s)" IS NOT NULL
) AS split_numbers
WHERE uniform_no <> ''
GROUP BY quarterback
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT uniform_no) = 2;

Results:
- Graham, Otto | 14,60
- Ninowski, Jim | 11,15
- Ratterman, George | 12,16

Conclusion:
- The data shows exactly three Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks with two distinct uniform numbers: Otto Graham (14, 60), Jim Ninowski (11, 15), and George Ratterman (12, 16). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Starting quarterbacks” refers to those listed in the table public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
- “Have 2 different uniform number” is interpreted as having exactly two distinct uniform numbers listed in the “uniform no (s)” field for that quarterback.
