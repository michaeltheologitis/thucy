Claim to verify: “Antonio Pompa-Baldi (Italy) was first in 1999 and 2000.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table public.cleveland_international_piano_competition containing columns: year, first, second, third, fourth.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Winner in 1999
SQL:
SELECT first, year FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 1999;
Result: first = “Antonio Pompa-Baldi” (Italy indicated in the result context), year = 1999.

2) Winner in 2000
SQL:
SELECT first, year FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 2000;
Result: No entry found (no recorded first-place winner for 2000 in this dataset).

Findings
- 1999: Supported. The dataset lists Antonio Pompa-Baldi as the first-place winner for 1999.
- 2000: Not supported. The dataset has no record for 2000, hence no evidence that anyone (including Antonio Pompa-Baldi) was first in 2000.

Conclusion
- The claim is only partly true: correct for 1999, unsupported for 2000 in the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the Cleveland International Piano Competition (the sole available dataset). Nationality is not a separate column; the mention of “Italy” reflects the context provided by the query result, not a dedicated field in the table.
