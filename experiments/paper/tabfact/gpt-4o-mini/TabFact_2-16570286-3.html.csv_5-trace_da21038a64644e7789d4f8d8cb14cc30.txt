Claim to verify: “the bowler with 13 wicket appear in less match than the bowler with 11 wicket.”

Data source explored: public.t_1948_ashes_series (1948 Ashes cricket series)
Relevant columns: player, team, matches, wickets

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Identify the bowler(s) with exactly 13 wickets:
SQL:
SELECT player, team, matches FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets = 13;
Result:
- Player: Keith Miller | Team: Australia | Matches: 5

2) Identify the bowler(s) with exactly 11 wickets:
SQL:
SELECT player, team, matches FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets = 11;
Result:
- Player: Ernie Toshack | Team: Australia | Matches: 4

Assessment:
- 13-wicket bowler (Keith Miller) played 5 matches.
- 11-wicket bowler (Ernie Toshack) played 4 matches.
- 5 is not less than 4. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The bowler with 13 wickets did not appear in fewer matches than the bowler with 11 wickets; he appeared in more matches.

Assumptions:
- The claim is evaluated within the available dataset (the 1948 Ashes series table). No other competitions or datasets are considered.
