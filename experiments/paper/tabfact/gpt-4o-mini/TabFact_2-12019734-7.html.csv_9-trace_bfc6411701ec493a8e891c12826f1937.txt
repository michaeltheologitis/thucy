Claim to verify: “On February 27, the score of the game with New Jersey as the home team was 1 - 4.”

Data source explored
- Available database: public schema
- Table: my_info_table
- Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Evidence collected
1) Establish table contents and context
- SQL (row count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM my_info_table;
  Result: 11
- SQL (sample rows):
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM my_info_table LIMIT 10;
  Returned sample included February entries (e.g., “February 24 | Detroit | New Jersey | 1 - 4 | 12 - 37 - 13”, “February 26 | New Jersey | Pittsburgh | 4 - 5 | 12 - 38 - 13”). This shows the dataset includes late-February games for New Jersey.

2) What happened on February 27?
- SQL (find any February 27 rows):
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%february 27%'
  Result: Date: February 27; Visitor: New Jersey; Home: Buffalo; Score: 2 - 6; Record: 12 - 39 - 13
  Interpretation: On February 27, New Jersey was the VISITOR at Buffalo, and the score was 2 - 6.

3) Was New Jersey the home team on February 27?
- SQL (explicitly search for New Jersey as home on Feb 27):
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
  FROM my_info_table 
  WHERE home ILIKE '%New Jersey%' AND date ILIKE '%February 27%';
  Result: No rows returned
  Interpretation: There is no record of New Jersey being the home team on February 27 in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. On February 27, New Jersey was not the home team; they played at Buffalo and lost 2 - 6. There is no evidence of a February 27 home game for New Jersey with a 1 - 4 score.

Notes on possible confusion
- The dataset shows a February 24 game where Detroit visited New Jersey and the score was 1 - 4, which might be the source of the “1 - 4” figure, but that was February 24, not February 27.

Assumptions
- The my_info_table is the authoritative source for these game results.
- Dates are recorded as literal month-day text (e.g., “February 27”).
- “New Jersey” refers to the team name string appearing in the home column when they are hosts.
- The claim’s lack of a year is resolved by using the entries present in this table for February of the season represented.
