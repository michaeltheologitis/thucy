Summary conclusion: The available data shows a bridge in Stanley with type recorded as "concrete deck girder bridge," supporting the claim that in Stanley the bridge is of the concrete deck girder style.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: my_info_table.
- Table schema (public.my_info_table): columns: name (text), listed (text), location (text), county (text), type (text). No primary/foreign keys.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Locate entries related to "Stanley" and inspect their recorded bridge type.
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT name, location, county, type, listed FROM my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE '%Stanley%' OR county ILIKE '%Stanley%';
   - Result row:
     • name: great northern railway underpass
     • location: stanley
     • county: mountrail
     • type: concrete deck girder bridge
     • listed: 1997 - 02 - 27

Assessment:
- The record for the Great Northern Railway Underpass in Stanley (Mountrail County) explicitly lists its type as "concrete deck girder bridge." This directly supports the claim that the bridge in Stanley is of the concrete deck girder style.

- "The bridge" refers to the identified entry in Stanley (Great Northern Railway Underpass).
- "Concrete deck girder style" aligns with the recorded type "concrete deck girder bridge."
