Claim interpreted: Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy (of Australia) were the only players at +1 to par in the referenced standings.

Data source discovery
- Available table found: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
- This table contains a 36-hole (two-round) leaderboard for the 2006 U.S. Open (Score column shows two rounds summed, e.g., “70 + 69 = 139”).

Table structure
- Columns (from information_schema): place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Listing tables (database introspection)
SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';
SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;

Result excerpt shows schema public includes table t_2006_u_s_open_golf.

2) Inspecting the standings (first 20 rows)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf LIMIT 20;

Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- 1 | Steve Stricker | United States | 70 + 69 = 139 | - 1
- 2 | Colin Montgomerie | Scotland | 69 + 71 = 140 | e
- t3 | Kenneth Ferrie | England | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1
- t3 | Geoff Ogilvy | Australia | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1
- t5 | Jim Furyk | United States | 70 + 72 = 142 | + 2
… (others at +2 or higher)

Observation: The only entries with to par = + 1 are Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy.

3) Explicitly list players at +1 and count them
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" = '+ 1';

Result:
- Kenneth Ferrie | England
- Geoff Ogilvy | Australia

4) Confirm there are only two +1 entries
SQL:
SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf GROUP BY "to par";

Relevant part of result shows “+ 1” occurs exactly 2 times, with no other players at +1.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly two players at +1 to par: Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy (country: Australia). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data in the context of this leaderboard snapshot.

Assumptions
- The table represents the 36-hole (through Round 2) leaderboard of the 2006 U.S. Open at Winged Foot, inferred from the two-round score formatting in the Score column. The conclusion applies to that stage of the tournament, not necessarily the final results.
