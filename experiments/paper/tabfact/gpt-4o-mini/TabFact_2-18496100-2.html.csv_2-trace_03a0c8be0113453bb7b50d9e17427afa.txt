Claim to verify: "gohad have 36732 more electorate in 2009 than bhander"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema containing table: bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
- Relevant columns per schema: "name" (text), "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence collected via executed SQL:
1) Retrieve 2009 electorate for Gohad
Executed SQL:
SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE LOWER("name") = LOWER('Gohad')
Result: 166,893

2) Retrieve 2009 electorate for Bhander
Executed SQL:
SELECT "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE LOWER("name") = LOWER('Bhander')
Result: 139,600

Computation based on evidence:
- Difference (Gohad minus Bhander) = 166,893 − 139,600 = 27,293

Assessment:
- The data shows Gohad does have more electorate than Bhander in 2009, but the margin is 27,293, not 36,732 as claimed. The direction is correct; the magnitude is not.

Conclusion:
- The specific numeric claim (36,732 more) is not supported by the data. The correct difference is 27,293.

Assumptions:
- "Electorate in 2009" refers to the column "number of electorates (2009)" in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table (which lists assembly segments within the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency). Names were matched case-insensitively for Gohad and Bhander.
