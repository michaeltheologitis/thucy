Overview of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with one table: public.my_info_table.
- Schema details (from inspection):
  - Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text).
  - No primary/foreign keys.

Evidence gathered:
1) Maximum number of discs across all volumes
- Result: 1
- SQL: SELECT MAX(discs) AS max_discs FROM public.my_info_table;

2) Count of rows where discs > 1
- Result: 0
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs > 1;

3) Distinct volumes with discs > 1 (preview up to 50)
- Result: No rows returned
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT volume, discs FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs > 1 LIMIT 50;

Conclusion:
- The data shows the highest number of disc releases (discs) for any volume is 1, and there are no entries with discs greater than 1. This supports the claim that the highest number of disc releases for any volume is only 1.

Assumptions made:
- "disc release" refers to the column discs in public.my_info_table.
- "volume" refers to the column volume in public.my_info_table.
