Claim interpreted: The user asserts that New Jersey was the visiting team against Buffalo on February 27.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table public.my_info_table.
- Schema details (public.my_info_table): columns are date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text).

Evidence gathered:
- I searched for rows where the visiting team includes 'New Jersey' and the home team includes 'Buffalo', and then specifically checked for a date matching February 27.
- Result found:
  - date: february 27
  - visitor: new jersey
  - home: buffalo
  - score: 2 - 6
  - record: 12 - 39 - 13

Executed SQL (exact):
1) List rows with New Jersey visiting Buffalo
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' 
AND home ILIKE '%Buffalo%';

2) Check specifically for February 27 among those matchups
SELECT * 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE (date ILIKE '%February 27%' OR date ILIKE '%Feb 27%') 
AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' 
AND home ILIKE '%Buffalo%';

Assessment:
- The data contains a game entry with visitor 'new jersey' at home 'buffalo' on 'february 27'. This directly supports the claim that New Jersey was the visiting team on February 27 against Buffalo.

Assumptions made:
- The table’s date field is text; 'february 27' is taken at face value without a specific year.
- Team labels 'new jersey' and 'buffalo' refer to the intended teams (e.g., Devils and Sabres), though the table does not include league or sport metadata.
- If multiple years exist, this verification confirms at least one occurrence on a February 27, not necessarily unique by year.
