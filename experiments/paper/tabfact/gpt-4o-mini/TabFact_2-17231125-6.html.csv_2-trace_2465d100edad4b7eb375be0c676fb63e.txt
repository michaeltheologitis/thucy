Data sources explored:
- Public schema (TabFact DB) with table: t_1988_u_s_open_golf (columns: place TEXT, player TEXT, country TEXT, score TEXT, "to par" TEXT).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate Fred Couples and read his recorded score
SQL:
SELECT player, score FROM t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'Fred Couples';
Result:
- player: Fred Couples
- score: "72 + 67 + 71 = 210"

2) Check whether that total exceeds 210 (as parsed from the score string)
SQL:
SELECT player, score, (CASE WHEN (72 + 67 + 71) > 210 THEN true ELSE false END) AS score_greater_than_210 FROM t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'Fred Couples';
Result:
- score_greater_than_210: false (since 72 + 67 + 71 = 210)

Conclusion:
- The recorded total for Fred Couples in this dataset is exactly 210, not larger than 210. Therefore, the claim that "fred couple have a score larger than 210" is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to golfer Fred Couples and the "score" column represents his total strokes as recorded in the 1988 U.S. Open table available in the data environment.
- "Larger than 210" is interpreted strictly as > 210 (not ≥ 210).
