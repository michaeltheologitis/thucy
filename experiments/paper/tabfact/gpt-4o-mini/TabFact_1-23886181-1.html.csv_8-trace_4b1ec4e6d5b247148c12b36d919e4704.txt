Claim to verify: “AC Sparta Prague and Team Netherlands are both located on the Asian continent.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs

Relevant schema (from data discovery):
- Columns: no (text), football club (text), continent (text), associated football club (text), seasons (text), racing drivers (text)
- The table includes football club names and their associated continent.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate AC Sparta Prague and its continent
- SQL Executed: SELECT "football club", continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Sparta%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Praha%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Prague%';
- Result excerpt: AC Sparta Prague | Europe

- Confirmation query
  SQL Executed: SELECT continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" ILIKE 'AC Sparta Prague';
  Result: Europe

2) Locate Team Netherlands and its continent
- SQL Executed: SELECT "football club", continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Netherlands%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Dutch%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Netherland%';
- Result excerpt: Team Netherlands | Europe

- Confirmation query
  SQL Executed: SELECT continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" ILIKE 'Team Netherlands';
  Result: Europe

Conclusion:
- The data shows both AC Sparta Prague and Team Netherlands are located in Europe, not Asia. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “Team Netherlands” in the user’s claim refers to the entity named “Team Netherlands” present in the available table, which the data identifies with continent = Europe.
