Claim to verify: "chris burke , be the only player to have a free transfer fee"

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee)

Evidence
1) All players with their transfer fees
SQL: SELECT name, "transfer fee" FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
Result highlight: Both "jean - claude darcheville" and "chris burke" have transfer fee listed as "free". Many others are "n / a"; some have fees like "1 m", "7.8 m", "3.5 m".

2) Count of players with a free transfer fee (matching any value containing "free")
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS free_transfer_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE LOWER("transfer fee") LIKE '%free%';
Result: 2

3) Names of players with a free transfer fee
SQL: SELECT name FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE LOWER("transfer fee") LIKE '%free%';
Result: Jean - Claude Darcheville; Chris Burke

Conclusion
- The data shows two players with a free transfer fee: Chris Burke and Jean - Claude Darcheville. Therefore, the claim that Chris Burke is the only player with a free transfer fee is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "free transfer fee" as any entry in the "transfer fee" column containing the word "free" (e.g., "free", "free transfer").
- Scope limited to the table t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season in the TabFact database.
