Claim to verify: “More viewers in the US watched the second episode of Dexter’s third season than the fourth episode.”

Evidence from data
- Episode 2 (Season 3): Finding Freebo — US viewers: 0.79 million
- Episode 4 (Season 3): All in the Family — US viewers: 0.86 million
- Comparison: 0.79 < 0.86 → Episode 4 had more US viewers than Episode 2.

Executed SQL (as returned by the query tool)
1) Identify table structure/sample rows
SELECT * FROM dexter_season_3 LIMIT 10;

2) Retrieve viewership for episodes 2 and 4
SELECT "no in season", "title", "us viewers (millions)" FROM dexter_season_3 WHERE "no in season" IN (2, 4);

Conclusion
- The data shows Episode 4 had higher US viewership than Episode 2, contradicting the claim.

Assumptions
- “Second episode” corresponds to Season 3 episode with "no in season" = 2; “fourth episode” corresponds to "no in season" = 4.
- “US viewers” refers to the column labeled "us viewers (millions)" in the dexter_season_3 table.
