Summary of data source discovery:
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season containing game-level records for the San Antonio Spurs 2008–09 season.

Schema inspection (context):
- Table public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), "high points" (text), "high rebounds" (text), "high assists" (text), "location attendance" (text), series (text).

Evidence query and results:
- Purpose: Retrieve the record for game 4 with fields needed to verify location/attendance and series status.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT game, "location attendance", series FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season WHERE game = 4;
- Result:
  - Game: 4
  - Location Attendance: American Airlines Center 20,829
  - Series: 1 - 3

Verification against the claim:
- Claimed: Game 4 location attendance is "AT&T Center 20491" and series is "1 - 1".
- Found in data: Location attendance is "American Airlines Center 20,829" and series is "1 - 3".
- Assessment: Both the venue (American Airlines Center, not AT&T Center), the attendance figure (20,829, not 20,491), and the series status (1 - 3, not 1 - 1) contradict the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "game 4" as referring to the game numbered 4 in the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season dataset, and "location attendance" as the venue name followed by attendance recorded in the "location attendance" text field. Interpreted "series" as the series status shown in the table for that game.
