Claim assessed: “after 2000 england, the united state, brazil, and puerto rico each contribute 1 player.”

Interpretation and scope
- Data source: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (Utah Jazz all-time roster). 
- Interpreting “after 2000” as players whose first season with the Jazz (the first 4-digit year extracted from the “years for jazz” field) is greater than 2000.
- “Contribute 1 player” interpreted as the count of players per listed nationality meeting the above date criterion equals 1.

Key evidence from the database
1) Count players by nationality with start_year > 2000
SQL executed:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '\d{4}')::int > 2000
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY nationality;

Result:
- Brazil: 1 player
- England: 1 player
- Puerto Rico: 1 player
- United States: 1 player

(These results directly support the claim as stated.)

Additional context (not required for verification but confirms available nationalities)
SQL executed:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(player) AS player_count 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
GROUP BY nationality 
ORDER BY player_count DESC;

Result summary:
- United States: 6 players (overall)
- England: 1 player (overall)
- Puerto Rico: 1 player (overall)
- Brazil: 1 player (overall)

Conclusion
- The counts for players starting after 2000 show that England, United States, Brazil, and Puerto Rico each have exactly 1 player, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “After 2000” means the first four-digit year extracted from “years for jazz” is greater than 2000 (i.e., start year > 2000).
- Nationality matching is case-sensitive to the stored values (England, United States, Brazil, Puerto Rico).
