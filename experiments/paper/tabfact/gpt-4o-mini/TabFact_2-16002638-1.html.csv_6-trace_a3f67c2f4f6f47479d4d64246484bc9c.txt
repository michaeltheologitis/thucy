Summary
- Claim: “the dundee hurricane have 4 losing season , 2003 , 2005 , 2007 , 2008.”
- Finding: The data shows only 2 losing seasons (2006 and 2009). The seasons 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2008 are not losing seasons.

Data source exploration
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: dundee_hurricanes
- Table columns: season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), "final position" (text), notes (text)

Evidence 1: Identify losing seasons (losses > wins)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, wins, losses, ties, notes 
  FROM dundee_hurricanes 
  WHERE losses > wins 
  ORDER BY season;
- Result (losing seasons):
  • 2006: 3–4–0
  • 2009: 2–6–1

- Executed SQL (count losing seasons):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_losing_seasons 
  FROM dundee_hurricanes 
  WHERE losses > wins;
- Result: total_losing_seasons = 2

Evidence 2: Context around 2000–2010
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, wins, losses, ties, "final position" FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season BETWEEN 2000 AND 2010;
- Relevant rows:
  • 2003: 6–4–0 (winning)
  • 2004: 6–2–1 (winning)
  • 2005: 5–5–0 (even)
  • 2006: 3–4–0 (losing)
  • 2007: 9–1–0 (winning)
  • 2008: 5–2–3 (winning)
  • 2009: 2–6–1 (losing)

Evidence 3: Direct check of the claimed seasons
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, wins, losses, ties FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season IN (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008);
- Results:
  • 2003: 6–4–0 (winning)
  • 2005: 5–5–0 (even)
  • 2007: 9–1–0 (winning)
  • 2008: 5–2–3 (winning)

Conclusion
- The claim lists four seasons (2003, 2005, 2007, 2008) as losing. The data shows none of these seasons are losing. The actual losing seasons in the dataset are 2006 and 2009, for a total of two losing seasons, not four.

Assumptions
- “Losing season” is defined as losses > wins; ties do not override that comparison.
