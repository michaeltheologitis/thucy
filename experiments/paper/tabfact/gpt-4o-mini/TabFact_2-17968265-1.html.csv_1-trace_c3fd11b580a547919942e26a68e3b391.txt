Claim interpreted: “Played equals 114 when points equals 107, and (also) when 1987-88 equals 31.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n (columns: played, average, points, "1988 - 89", "1986 - 87", "1987 - 88", team)

Schema/sample confirmation (context)
- SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n';
- SQL:
  SELECT * 
  FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n 
  LIMIT 5;

Evidence 1: When points = 107, played = 114
- SQL:
  SELECT team, points, played 
  FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n 
  WHERE points = 107;
- Result summary: Ferro Carril Oeste has points = 107 and played = 114.

Evidence 2: When 1987-88 = 31, played = 114
- SQL:
  SELECT team, "1987 - 88", played, points 
  FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n 
  WHERE "1987 - 88" = '31';
- Result summary: Racing de Córdoba has "1987 - 88" = 31 and played = 114 (points = 97).

Additional check (for the stricter, single-row interpretation)
- SQL:
  SELECT team, played, points, "1987 - 88" 
  FROM public.t_1988_89_argentine_primera_divisi_n 
  WHERE points = 107 AND "1987 - 88" = '31' 
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: No row satisfies both conditions simultaneously.

Conclusion
- The table shows that in the row where points = 107, played = 114, and in the (separate) row where 1987-88 = 31, played = 114. Under the interpretation that these are two separate cases, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the statement as asserting two separate conditions that each imply played = 114, not that a single row simultaneously satisfies both conditions.
