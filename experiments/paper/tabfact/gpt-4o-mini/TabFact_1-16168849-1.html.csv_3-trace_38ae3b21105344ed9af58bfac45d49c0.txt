Claim to verify: “the conference for the college that left in 1974 and again in 1989 is the AAC (NAIA).”

Interpretation: Identify the institution that left (the North State Conference) in 1974 and again in 1989, then verify its conference affiliation (specifically whether it is AAC (NAIA)).

Evidence from the data

1) Identify which institution(s) have leave years 1974 and/or 1989
- Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, joined, "left", "current conference" 
FROM public.north_state_conference 
WHERE CAST("left" AS text) ILIKE '%1974%' OR CAST("left" AS text) ILIKE '%1989%';
- Returned (relevant excerpt):
  • Lenoir-Rhyne University — Joined: 1930, 1985; Left: 1974, 1989; Current Conference: SAC
  • Catawba College — Joined: 1930; Left: 1989; Current Conference: SAC
  • Elon University — Joined: 1930; Left: 1989; Current Conference: SOCON (CAA in 2014) (NCAA Division I)

This shows the only institution with both 1974 and 1989 as leave years is Lenoir-Rhyne University.

2) Confirm Lenoir-Rhyne University’s current conference
- Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, "current conference", joined, "left" FROM public.north_state_conference WHERE LOWER(institution) LIKE '%lenoir%';
- Returned:
  • Institution: Lenoir-Rhyne University
    - Current Conference: SAC (South Atlantic Conference)
    - Joined: 1930, 1985
    - Left: 1974, 1989

Conclusion
- The college that left in 1974 and again in 1989 is Lenoir-Rhyne University. According to the data, its current conference is SAC (South Atlantic Conference), not AAC (NAIA). Therefore, the claim that its conference “be the AAC (NAIA)” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “the college that leave in 1974, and again in 1989” as referring to an institution’s North State Conference membership history. The table public.north_state_conference contains these membership events, and “current conference” reflects their present-day affiliation.
- I interpreted the user’s question as asserting/asking whether that institution’s conference is the AAC (NAIA).
