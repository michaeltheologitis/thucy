Claim to verify: "the highest attendance of the season be on september 5"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema containing table t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (Arizona Diamondbacks 2008 season).
- Table schema:
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)
  - loss (text)
  - attendance (bigint)
  - record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the maximum attendance and its date(s)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season);
- Result:
  - Date: September 7, Opponent: Dodgers, Attendance: 54,137

2) Show the top 5 attendances for context
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance
  FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
  ORDER BY attendance DESC
  LIMIT 5;
- Result (ordered by attendance desc):
  1. September 7 — Dodgers — 54,137
  2. September 5 — Dodgers — 52,270
  3. September 6 — Dodgers — 47,543
  4. September 13 — Reds — 45,075
  5. September 19 — Rockies — 43,137

Conclusion:
- The highest attendance of the season occurred on September 7 (54,137), not on September 5. September 5 had 52,270, which is lower than the maximum.

Assumptions:
- “Season” refers to the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season because this is the only accessible dataset. Dates are used as stored (text) in this table and correspond to 2008 game dates.
