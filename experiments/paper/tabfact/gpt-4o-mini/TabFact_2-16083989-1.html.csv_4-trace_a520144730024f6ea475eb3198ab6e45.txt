Summary
- Claim: “the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis be negative.”
- Finding: The data shows Proteus mirabilis is methyl red positive.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with schema public and table imvic.

Schema details (from schema inspection)
- Table: public.imvic
- Columns: species (text), indole (text), "methyl red" (text), "voges - proskauer" (text), citrate (text)

Evidence
1) Query: List all IMViC results
SQL: SELECT species, indole, "methyl red", "voges - proskauer", citrate FROM public.imvic;
Result excerpt (relevant row):
- species: proteus mirabilis | indole: negative | methyl red: positive | voges - proskauer: negative | citrate: positive

2) Query: Retrieve IMViC results specifically for proteus mirabilis
SQL: SELECT species, indole, "methyl red", "voges - proskauer", citrate FROM public.imvic WHERE species = 'proteus mirabilis';
Result:
- Indole: negative
- Methyl Red: positive
- Voges-Proskauer: negative
- Citrate: positive

Conclusion
- The database shows Proteus mirabilis is methyl red positive. Therefore, the claim that the methyl red reading is negative is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Methyl red reading” is interpreted as the MR result within the IMViC test panel.
- Species naming in the data is authoritative and uses lowercase (e.g., 'proteus mirabilis').
