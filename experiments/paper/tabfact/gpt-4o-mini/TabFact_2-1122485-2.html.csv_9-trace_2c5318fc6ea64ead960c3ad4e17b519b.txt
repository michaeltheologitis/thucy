Interpretation of the claim: The phrase "any driver above 75 lap care trouble of some kind thus no time list" is taken to mean: Are there any drivers who completed more than 75 laps but had car trouble (i.e., are marked as retired/with an issue) and therefore do not have a finishing time listed?

Data source discovery and inspection
- I examined the only available dataset: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix, which contains the 1971 South African Grand Prix results with fields for Driver, Constructor, Grid, Laps, and Time / Retired.

Evidence 1: Sample of the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix LIMIT 5;
Key observation: The table includes a "Time / Retired" field that shows either a finish time/gap (e.g., "+ 20.9", "+ 1 lap", or a total time like "1:47:35.5") or a retirement reason (e.g., "engine", "gearbox").

Evidence 2: Full dataset ordered by grid (to see context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix ORDER BY "grid" ASC;
Key observation: Drivers with laps greater than 75 (77–79 laps) all have times/gaps recorded (e.g., "+ 2 laps", "+ 1 lap", "+ 31.4", etc.). Retirements (e.g., "engine", "gearbox", "accident") occur at substantially fewer laps (e.g., 58, 56, 45, etc.).

Evidence 3: Identify the exact set of finish/retirement values
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "time / retired" FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix ORDER BY "time / retired" ASC;
Distinct values found include finish times/gaps ("1:47:35.5", "+ 20.9", "+ 31.4", "+ 1:09.4", "+ 1 lap", "+ 2 laps", "+ 4 laps") and retirement reasons ("engine", "gearbox", "accident", "overheating", "fuel leak", "differential", "suspension", "physical").

Evidence 4: Direct test of the claim (Laps > 75 and retirement reason)
Executed SQL (filter for >75 laps and retirement reasons):
SELECT Driver, Laps, "time / retired" 
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE Laps > 75 
  AND "time / retired" IN ('engine', 'gearbox', 'accident', 'overheating', 'fuel leak', 'differential', 'suspension', 'physical');
Result: No rows returned. This shows there are no drivers who completed more than 75 laps and have a retirement reason (i.e., "no time listed").

Corroboration query (show who did >75 laps):
Executed SQL:
SELECT Driver, Laps, "time / retired" 
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE Laps > 75;
Result (examples):
- Mario Andretti — 79 — 1:47:35.5
- Jackie Stewart — 79 — + 20.9
- Clay Regazzoni — 79 — + 31.4
- Reine Wisell — 79 — + 1:09.4
- Chris Amon — 78 — + 1 lap
- Denny Hulme — 78 — + 1 lap
- Jacky Ickx — 78 — + 1 lap
- Brian Redman — 78 — + 1 lap
- Graham Hill — 77 — + 2 laps
- Ronnie Peterson — 77 — + 2 laps
- Henri Pescarolo — 77 — + 2 laps
- Rolf Stommelen — 77 — + 2 laps
All have a time/gap recorded, not a retirement reason.

Conclusion
- The data shows no drivers with more than 75 laps who suffered car trouble (retirement) resulting in no time listed. All drivers above 75 laps have a finishing time/gap. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "Above 75 lap" is interpreted as Laps > 75.
- "Care trouble of some kind thus no time list" is interpreted as having a retirement reason (e.g., engine, gearbox, accident, etc.) in the "Time / Retired" field rather than a finishing time/gap.
