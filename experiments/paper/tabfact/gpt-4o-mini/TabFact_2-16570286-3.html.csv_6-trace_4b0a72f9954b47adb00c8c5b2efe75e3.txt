Claim to verify: “Ray Lindwall took a higher number of wickets than Bill Johnston but had a worse bowling average.”

Data exploration
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1948_ashes_series, which contains player-level bowling statistics for the 1948 Ashes series.
- Schema (t_1948_ashes_series):
  - player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text)

Evidence gathered
- Query executed to retrieve the relevant players’ statistics:
  SQL:
  SELECT player, wickets, average 
  FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series 
  WHERE LOWER(player) LIKE '%lindwall%' OR LOWER(player) LIKE '%johnston%';

- Results:
  - Ray Lindwall: 27 wickets, average 19.62
  - Bill Johnston: 27 wickets, average 23.33

Assessment against the claim
- “Ray Lindwall took a higher number of wickets than Bill Johnston”: Not supported. Both took 27 wickets in the 1948 Ashes series.
- “…but had a worse bowling average”: Not supported. In cricket, a lower bowling average is better. Lindwall’s average (19.62) is lower (better) than Johnston’s (23.33), so he did not have a worse average.

Conclusion
- The data contradicts both parts of the claim within the 1948 Ashes dataset: Lindwall did not take more wickets than Johnston, and his bowling average was better, not worse.

Assumptions
- Because the available authoritative dataset covers the 1948 Ashes series, the claim was interpreted as referring to that series specifically, rather than career totals.
