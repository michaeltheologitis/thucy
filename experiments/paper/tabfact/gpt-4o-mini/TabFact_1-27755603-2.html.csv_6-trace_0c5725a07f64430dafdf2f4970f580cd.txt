Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. In the game where the 'high points' entry is Austin Daye (16) — which is the lowest point total among his appearances as the Pistons’ game-high scorer in this dataset — the opponent listed in the table is Dallas.

Step-by-step verification and evidence

1) Identify all games where Austin Daye was the Pistons’ high scorer and extract points
- Result (ordered by points ascending):
  • Game 4 | Date: October 13 | High Points: austin daye (16) | Points: 16 | Location Attendance: van andel arena 10207
  • Game 5 | Date: October 15 | High Points: austin daye (18) | Points: 18 | Location Attendance: carrier dome 11747
  • Game 2 | Date: October 8  | High Points: austin daye (21) | Points: 21 | Location Attendance: the palace of auburn hills 12821
- Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, "high points", CAST(SUBSTRING("high points" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS points, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high points" LIKE 'austin daye (%'
ORDER BY points ASC;

2) Confirm the minimum-points (lowest) Austin Daye entry and retrieve the opponent
- Result:
  • Date: October 13 | Team (opponent): Dallas | High Points: Austin Daye (16) | Score: L 96 - 101 (OT) | Location Attendance: Van Andel Arena 10207
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "high points", score, "location attendance" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season 
WHERE "high points" LIKE 'austin daye (%' 
ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING("high points" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) ASC 
LIMIT 1;

3) Direct lookup of the specific row with “austin daye (16)” to verify the opponent
- Result:
  • Game: 4 | Date: October 13 | Team: Dallas | Score: L 96 - 101 (OT) | High Rebounds: Ben Wallace, Jason Maxiell (8) | High Assists: Rodney Stuckey (6) | Location Attendance: Van Andel Arena 10207 | Record: 2 - 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high points" = 'austin daye (16)';

Interpretation
- The dataset’s 'high points' field records the Pistons’ leading scorer and their points for each game; Austin Daye appears with 21, 18, and 16, with 16 being the lowest among those.
- For the row where 'high points' is Austin Daye (16), the 'team' column shows Dallas, indicating Dallas was the opponent in that game.

Assumptions
- “Lowest point” is interpreted as the lowest point total for entries where Austin Daye is listed in the 'high points' field (i.e., as the Pistons’ leading scorer in the game), within the available 2010–11 Pistons dataset rows (which include preseason games). 
- The 'team' column is interpreted as the opponent team for that game, as evidenced by values like Miami and Dallas rather than “Detroit Pistons.”
