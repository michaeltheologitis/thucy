Conclusion: The claim holds true in this dataset because Diego Milito’s recorded debut year in Italy is 2008, so there are zero records of him with a debut year before 2008; consequently, “0 goal occur … in a debut year before 2008” is satisfied (no such case exists).

Evidence from the database
1) Inspect sample rows to understand table contents
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.football_records_in_italy LIMIT 10;

Relevant sample row returned shows Diego Milito with debut year 2008 and goals 86 (apps 145, club Inter).

2) Retrieve Diego Milito’s record
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Diego Milito%';

Result (key fields):
- Debut Year: 2008
- Goals: 86
- Appearances: 145
- Current Club: Inter

3) Check for any record of Diego Milito with debut year before 2008 (regardless of goals)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name = 'Diego Milito' AND "debut year" < 2008;

Result: 0

4) Specifically check for records with debut year before 2008 and goals = 0
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count 
FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
WHERE name = 'Diego Milito' 
AND "debut year" < 2008 
AND goals = 0;

Result: 0

Interpretation
- The dataset records Diego Milito’s debut year (in Italy) as 2008 and total goals as 86. There are no records for him with a debut year earlier than 2008; therefore, there are zero occurrences where Diego Milito has “0 goal” tied to a debut year before 2008 in this dataset. This makes the statement true within the scope of the available data.

Assumptions
- “debut year” refers to the 'debut year' column in the table (interpreted as debut in Italian football per the dataset’s domain).
- “0 goal occur … in a debut year before 2008” is interpreted as: there are zero records for Diego Milito with a debut year < 2008 (and, more strictly, zero such records with goals = 0), which matches the data returned above.
