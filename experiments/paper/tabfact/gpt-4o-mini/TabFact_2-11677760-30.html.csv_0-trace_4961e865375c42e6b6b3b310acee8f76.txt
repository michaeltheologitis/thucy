Summary of verification
- Claim: "Shabazz Muhammad attend UCLA and his hometown be Las Vega(s), NV."
- Interpretation: The claim asserts that (1) Shabazz Muhammad’s college is UCLA and (2) his hometown is Las Vegas, NV.

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team
- Columns: player (text), height (text), school (text), hometown (text), college (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial exact-match lookup (no row returned):
SQL: SELECT player, school, hometown, college FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player = 'Shabazz Muhammad';

2) Case-insensitive search by last name (returned the player row):
SQL: SELECT player, school, hometown, college FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE '%Muhammad%';
Result:
- player: Shabazz Muhammad

- college: UCLA

Assessment

Assumptions
- "Attend UCLA" is interpreted as his listed college being UCLA.
- "Hometown" is taken from the dataset’s hometown field.
- The misspelling "Las Vega" is interpreted as "Las Vegas."
