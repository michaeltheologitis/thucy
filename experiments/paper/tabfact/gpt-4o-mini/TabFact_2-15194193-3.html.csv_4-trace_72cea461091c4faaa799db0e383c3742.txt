Claim to verify: "alberto pagani have race for aermacchi 10 time , more than any other team"

Data discovery
- Available source: 1 PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.alberto_pagani.

Schema understanding
- Table: alberto_pagani
  - year (bigint): season year
  - class (text): motorcycle class/category
  - team (text): team/manufacturer for that season entry
  - points (bigint): total season points
  - wins (bigint): total season wins
- No primary keys or foreign keys.

Evidence
1) Count of season entries by team (to see which team appears most for Alberto Pagani):
SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS season_entries
FROM alberto_pagani
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY season_entries DESC;
Result:
- Aermacchi: 10
- Norton: 4
- MV Agusta: 4
- Linto: 4
- Honda: 2
- Derbi: 1
- Paton: 1
- Suzuki: 1
- Ducati: 1
- Kreidler: 1

2) Team(s) with the maximum number of season entries:
SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(year) AS season_entries
FROM alberto_pagani
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY season_entries DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result: aermacchi — 10

3) Direct count of Aermacchi entries:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS season_count FROM alberto_pagani WHERE LOWER(team) = LOWER('Aermacchi');
Result: 10

Assessment
- The data show Aermacchi associated with 10 season entries for Alberto Pagani, which is higher than any other team in the table (next highest is 4).
- Therefore, within the available dataset, the statement that he raced for Aermacchi 10 times and that this is more than any other team is supported.

Assumptions
- The available data is organized at the season-entry level (per year/class/team), not per individual race start. I interpreted “times” as “season entries” due to the table’s granularity.
- “Team” in this dataset represents the team/manufacturer label recorded in the team column (e.g., Aermacchi) for those season entries.
