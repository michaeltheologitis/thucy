Summary conclusion: Carlton was the highest-scoring team among the matches played on 18 June (in the available dataset for the 1938 VFL season).

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1938_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Step 1 — Confirm the relevant date present in the data
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season ORDER BY date ASC;
Result:
- 18 June 1938

Step 2 — Retrieve all matches on 18 June and their scores
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season 
WHERE date ILIKE '%18 June%';
Results (summarized):
- Geelong vs Hawthorn — 11.23 (89) to 6.13 (49) — Corio Oval

- North Melbourne vs Carlton — 11.5 (71) to 16.25 (121) — Arden Street Oval

Step 3 — Determine the highest-scoring team on that date
- From the totals in parentheses, the highest single-team score on 18 June 1938 is 121 points by Carlton (16.25 (121)).
- The next highest totals in the list are Melbourne with 112, Fitzroy with 108, and Richmond with 104.

Conclusion: The data shows Carlton recorded the highest score among all teams that played on 18 June 1938, so the claim is supported.

Assumptions made:
