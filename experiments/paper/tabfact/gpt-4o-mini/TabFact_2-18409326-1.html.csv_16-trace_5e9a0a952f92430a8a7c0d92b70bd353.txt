Conclusion:
- The claim is not supported by the data in the available dataset. In Kelowna, CBC owns 3 radio stations, while Bell Media owns 2, not 3. Therefore, the statement that “Bell Media own 3 separate radio station like the CBC” is inaccurate in this context.

Assumptions and scope:
- Available data covers the Kelowna market only. I interpreted the claim within this scope due to data availability. National ownership totals are not assessed here.
