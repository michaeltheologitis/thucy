Conclusion: Within the available New Jersey Nets 2010–11 season data, Brook Lopez led the team in both points and rebounds in the same game exactly 3 times.

Key evidence from the database
1) Identify all games where Brook Lopez was both the team-high scorer and rebounder
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, "high points" AS high_points_raw, "high rebounds" AS high_rebounds_raw
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
WHERE lower("high points") LIKE 'brook lopez (%' AND lower("high rebounds") LIKE 'brook lopez (%'
ORDER BY game;

Result:
- Game 77 (April 5): High Points: Brook Lopez (30); High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (12)
- Game 78 (April 6): High Points: Brook Lopez (39); High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (7)
- Game 80 (April 10): High Points: Brook Lopez (35); High Rebounds: Brook Lopez (11)

2) Count of such games
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS both_points_and_rebounds_by_lopez
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
WHERE lower("high points") LIKE 'brook lopez (%' AND lower("high rebounds") LIKE 'brook lopez (%';

Result: 3

3) Check for ties (to ensure “led the team” is unambiguous)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tie_points FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high points" LIKE '%,%';
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tie_rebounds FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%';

Result: tie_points = 0; tie_rebounds = 0 (no ties recorded in this dataset)

Assumptions
- Scope: The claim is interpreted within the available dataset (New Jersey Nets 2010–11 season). No other seasons or teams are included in the accessible data.
- Definition: “Led the team” is taken to mean recorded the team-high in that category for the Nets in the given game (as captured in the “high points” and “high rebounds” columns).
