Claim to verify: “the only total that appear more than 2 time be 22.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
- Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text)

Schema evidence (from schema inspection):
- The column total exists in public.list_of_sumo_record_holders (type: bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Purpose: Count occurrences of each total and identify which exceed 2.
Executed SQL:
SELECT total, COUNT(*) AS count,
       COUNT(*) > 2 AS has_count_greater_than_2
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY total
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result snapshot:
- total 22 -> count 3 -> has_count_greater_than_2: true
- total 26 -> count 2 -> false
- total 30 -> count 2 -> false
- total 27 -> count 2 -> false
- total 34 -> count 1 -> false
- total 31 -> count 1 -> false
- total 32 -> count 1 -> false

2) Purpose: Directly list totals with count > 2 via HAVING.
Executed SQL:
SELECT total, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY total
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;
Result:
- total 22, count 3

Conclusion:
- The only total value appearing more than 2 times is 22 (appears 3 times). No other total has count > 2.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the column named total in the table public.list_of_sumo_record_holders.
- “appear more than 2 time” was interpreted as occurrences with COUNT(*) > 2.
