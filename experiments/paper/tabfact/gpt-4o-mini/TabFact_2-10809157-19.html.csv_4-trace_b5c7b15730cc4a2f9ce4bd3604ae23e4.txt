Claim to verify: “the home team score when the vfl play at prince park be 21.18 (144)”.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact, Schema: public, Table: t_1969_vfl_season (1969 VFL match results including date, teams, scores, venue, crowd)

Evidence 1: Inspect sample rows to understand columns and context
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season LIMIT 5;
Result (abridged):
- 23 August 1969 | Geelong vs Hawthorn | Home Team Score: 16.14 (110) | Venue: Kardinia Park
- 23 August 1969 | Collingwood vs South Melbourne | Home Team Score: 19.15 (129) | Venue: Victoria Park
- 23 August 1969 | Carlton vs Richmond | Home Team Score: 20.7 (127) | Venue: Princes Park
- 23 August 1969 | St Kilda vs North Melbourne | Home Team Score: 21.18 (144) | Venue: Moorabbin Oval
- 23 August 1969 | Melbourne vs Fitzroy | Home Team Score: 14.13 (97) | Venue: MCG

Observation: The score 21.18 (144) appears for St Kilda at Moorabbin Oval, not at Princes Park.

Evidence 2: Retrieve all matches at Princes Park and the home score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", crowd
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season
WHERE "venue" = 'princes park';
Result:
- Date: 23 August 1969 | Home Team: Carlton | Home Team Score: 20.7 (127) | Away Team: Richmond | Away Team Score: 24.12 (156) | Crowd: 27,657

Conclusion
- In the available 1969 VFL dataset, the home team score at Princes Park is 20.7 (127), not 21.18 (144). The specific score 21.18 (144) occurred at Moorabbin Oval. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “when the VFL play at Princes Park” as referring to the record(s) for Princes Park in the provided 1969 dataset (which covers matches on 23 August 1969). Venue matching treated case-insensitively as 'princes park'.
