Claim interpreted: “only 2 team (Hawthorn and South Melbourne) score more than 10.” Within the available, authoritative dataset (1938 VFL season, table t_1938_vfl_season), scores are stored as text in the format G.B (Total Points). I interpret “score more than 10” as “score more than 10 goals in a match.”

Data source overview
- Database table: t_1938_vfl_season (1938 Victorian Football League season)
- Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence
1) Sample rows to inspect score format and typical results
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date 
FROM t_1938_vfl_season 
LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt (shows many teams with >10 goals on 18 June 1938):
- Geelong 11.23 (89) vs Hawthorn 6.13 (49)
- Fitzroy 16.12 (108) vs South Melbourne 8.8 (56)
- St Kilda 14.12 (96) vs Melbourne 16.16 (112)
- Richmond 15.14 (104) vs Essendon 15.9 (99)
- Footscray 13.9 (87) vs Collingwood 10.5 (65)
- North Melbourne 11.5 (71) vs Carlton 16.25 (121)
This one round already shows at least nine teams exceeding 10 goals, contradicting the claim that only two teams did so.

2) Season-wide count of distinct teams that scored >10 goals in any game
SQL executed:
WITH all_scores AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team,
         split_part(split_part("home team score", ' ', 1), '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT "away team" AS team,
         split_part(split_part("away team score", ' ', 1), '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN goals > 10 THEN team END) AS num_teams_over_10,
       string_agg(DISTINCT CASE WHEN goals > 10 THEN team END, ', ' ORDER BY team) AS teams_over_10
FROM all_scores;
Result:
- num_teams_over_10 = 9
- teams_over_10 = Carlton, Essendon, Fitzroy, Footscray, Geelong, Melbourne, North Melbourne, Richmond, St Kilda
Observation: More than two teams scored >10 goals in at least one match. Notably, Hawthorn and South Melbourne are not in this list of teams that exceeded 10 goals even once in 1938.

3) Concrete rows of teams with >10 goals (illustrative)
SQL executed:
WITH all_scores AS (
  SELECT date, "home team" AS team, split_part(split_part("home team score", ' ', 1), '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM t_1938_vfl_season
  UNION ALL
  SELECT date, "away team" AS team, split_part(split_part("away team score", ' ', 1), '.', 1)::int AS goals
  FROM t_1938_vfl_season
)
SELECT date, team, goals
FROM all_scores
WHERE goals > 10
ORDER BY date, team
LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt (18 June 1938): Carlton 16, Essendon 15, Fitzroy 16, Footscray 13, Geelong 11, Melbourne 16, North Melbourne 11, Richmond 15, St Kilda 14.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. In the 1938 VFL season data, at least nine distinct teams scored more than 10 goals in a match. It is not true that only two teams did so, nor that those two were Hawthorn and South Melbourne.

Assumptions made (due to brevity of claim):
- “Score more than 10” refers to goals in an individual match (parsed from the G.B score text).
- Scope is the available 1938 VFL season dataset (table t_1938_vfl_season). If a different season, competition, or metric (e.g., wins, behinds, or total points) was intended, conclusions could differ, but within this dataset the claim does not hold.
