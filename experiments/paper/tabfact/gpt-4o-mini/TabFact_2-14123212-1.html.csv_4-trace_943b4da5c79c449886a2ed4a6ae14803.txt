Claim: “Illinois and Indiana each have 3 translator.”

Data source discovery
- Evidence: Confirm available base tables and the presence of public.whlp
  SQL executed:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
  Result excerpt: Schema: public; Table: whlp

Table structure inspection
- Evidence: Columns in public.whlp
  SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='whlp' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  Result:
  - call sign (text, nullable)
  - frequency mhz (double precision, nullable)
  - city of license (text, nullable)
  - erp w (bigint, nullable)
  - class (text, nullable)
  - fcc info (text, nullable)

Understanding state encoding
- Evidence: Sample rows showing state in “city of license”
  SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.whlp LIMIT 10;
  Sample results include entries like:
  - w221by | 92.1 | Elgin , Illinois | 38 | d | fcc
  - w240bj | 95.9 | Crown Point , Indiana | 10 | d | fcc

Verification by counts
- Evidence: Count entries whose “city of license” contains ‘Illinois’ or ‘Indiana’
  SQL executed:
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN "city of license" ILIKE '%Illinois%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS illinois_count, SUM(CASE WHEN "city of license" ILIKE '%Indiana%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS indiana_count FROM public.whlp;
  Result: illinois_count = 3; indiana_count = 3

Supporting detail: list entries per state
- Illinois entries
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license" FROM public.whlp WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%Illinois%';
  Results:
  1) w221by | 92.1 | Elgin, Illinois
  2) w264bf | 100.7 | Englewood, Illinois
  3) w276bm | 103.1 | Park Forest, Illinois

- Indiana entries
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license" FROM public.whlp WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%Indiana%';
  Results:
  1) w240bj | 95.9 | Crown Point, Indiana
  2) w293al | 106.5 | Rochester, Indiana
  3) w223au | 92.5 | South Bend, Indiana

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 3 entries in Illinois and 3 in Indiana. The claim is supported by the evidence from public.whlp.

Assumptions
- “translator” refers to the entries listed in public.whlp (which appear to be radio translators, as suggested by columns such as call sign, frequency, ERP, class, and FCC info).
- State attribution is derived from the text contained in the “city of license” field by matching the state name within the string.
