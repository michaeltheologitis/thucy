What I checked
- Whether “FC Basel 1893” is categorized as an Asian club in the available data, and whether it is “one of the two football clubs in Asia.”
- Whether “FC Basel 1893” participated in the 2008 and 2010 seasons (interpreted within the dataset’s competition context).

Evidence from the data
1) FC Basel 1893 entry (continent and seasons)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", "associated football club", "continent", "seasons" 
FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs 
WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%FC Basel 1893%';

Result (summarized):
- Football Club: FC Basel 1893
- Associated Football Club: FC Basel
- Continent: Europe
- Seasons: 2008, 2009, 2010

2) How many entries are labeled as Asia
Executed SQL:
SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs GROUP BY continent;

Result (summarized):
- Asia: 2 rows
- Europe: 9 rows
- Oceania: 2 rows
- South America: 1 row

3) Which clubs are labeled as Asia
Executed SQL:
SELECT "football club", "associated football club", "continent", "seasons" FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "continent" ILIKE '%Asia%';

Result (summarized):
- Football Club: Team Japan | Associated: None | Continent: Asia | Seasons: 2011
- Football Club: Beijing Guoan | Associated: Beijing Guoan FC | Continent: Asia | Seasons: 2008, 2010

Assessment of the claim
- “FC Basel 1893 be 1 of the 2 football club in Asia”: Not supported. The two Asian entries are Team Japan and Beijing Guoan. FC Basel 1893 is listed under Europe.
- “and participate in the 2008 an 2010 season”: Supported. The FC Basel 1893 row shows seasons 2008, 2009, 2010; therefore, it participated in both 2008 and 2010.

Conclusion:
- The continent part is incorrect; the seasons part is correct.

Assumptions made
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs), which catalogs entries for the Superleague Formula series. “Participate in the 2008 and 2010 season” is interpreted as participation in Superleague Formula seasons.
