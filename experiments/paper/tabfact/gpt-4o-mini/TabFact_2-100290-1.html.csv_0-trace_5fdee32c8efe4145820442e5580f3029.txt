Claim: “the at90s1200 chip have a frequency of 12 mhz.”

Finding: Supported by the available data. The AT90S1200 entry in the microcontrollers specification table lists frequency = 12 (interpreted as MHz based on context and comparable entries).

Evidence from data (including exact executed SQL):

1) Retrieve the AT90S1200 row
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(chip) = LOWER('AT90S1200')
- Result (key fields):
  • chip: at90s1200
  • flash size: 1k
  • eeprom: 64
  • sram: 0
  • frequency: 12
  • package: pdip - 20

2) Sample of chips and their frequency values to infer units (shows typical AVR values like 8, 10, 12) 
- Executed SQL:
SELECT chip, frequency FROM my_info_table LIMIT 10;
- Result (excerpt):
  • at90s1200 — 12
  • at90s2313 — 10
  • at90s / ls2323 — 10
  • at90s / ls2343 — 10
  • at90s4414 — 8
  • at90s / ls4434 — 8
  • at90s8515 — 8
  • at90s / ls8535 — 8

Conclusion: The database explicitly lists AT90S1200 with frequency 12. Given the context of peer entries (8 and 10 for related parts), the unit is consistent with MHz. Therefore, the claim is supported.

Assumptions:
- “frequency” in the table denotes maximum operating clock frequency and is measured in MHz.
- The claim “have a frequency of 12 mhz” is interpreted as “supports operation up to 12 MHz.”
