Claim interpreted: The gold medalist for equestrian at the Asian Games has been different in every edition/year it occurred.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games(year bigint, location text, gold text, silver text, bronze text)

Step 1: Retrieve all rows to inspect gold medalists by year
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
Result:
- 1982 | New Delhi  | Nadia Al - Moutawaa
- 1986 | Seoul      | Takashi Tomura
- 1994 | Hiroshima  | Konoshin Kuwahara
- 1998 | Bangkok    | Jin Kanno
- 2002 | Busan      | Mikaela Marãda Jaworski
- 2006 | Doha       | Ali Yousuf Al - Rumaihi
- 2010 | Guangzhou  | Ramzy Al Duhami

Step 2: Check for any repeated gold medalist names
Executed SQL:
SELECT gold AS name, COUNT(gold) AS occurrence_count 
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
GROUP BY gold 
HAVING COUNT(gold) > 1 
ORDER BY occurrence_count DESC;
Result: No rows returned (no repeated gold medalist names).

Step 3: Confirm counts of total rows vs. distinct gold medalists
Executed SQL 1:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
Result: 7
Executed SQL 2:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT gold) AS distinct_gold_medalists FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
Result: 7

Findings
- The dataset contains 7 editions/years of equestrian at the Asian Games with a single gold medalist listed for each.
- The number of distinct gold medalist names equals the total number of rows (7), and a direct duplicate check returns no repeated names.

Conclusion
- The evidence supports the claim that the gold medalist has been different in every year listed in the dataset.

Assumptions
- The table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games is complete for the editions/years in scope, and the ‘gold’ field represents the overall equestrian gold medalist relevant to this table’s definition. No external events or categories beyond what this table captures are included in the claim’s scope.
