Claim: From 2007 to 2011, Olga Govortsova’s WTA year-end ranking never went up.

What the data shows
- Source table: olga_govortsova (years 2007–2011)
- Retrieved the “year end ranking” row across 2007–2011.

Executed SQL (full table slice for context):
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM olga_govortsova;

Key returned row:
- tournament: year end ranking
- 2007: 49
- 2008: 49
- 2009: 52
- 2010: 74
- 2011: 114

Executed SQL (targeted):
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'year end ranking';

Returned values:
- 2007 = 49
- 2008 = 49
- 2009 = 52
- 2010 = 74
- 2011 = 114

Assessment
- Year-over-year changes: 2008 equals 2007 (no improvement), 2009 is worse (higher number), 2010 worse, 2011 worse.
- There is no year in 2008–2011 where the year-end ranking improves (i.e., becomes a lower number than the previous year). Thus, the ranking never “went up” in the sense of improving.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreting “go up” to mean “improve” (achieve a better ranking, i.e., a lower number). If “go up” were interpreted as the numerical ranking value increasing (which is worse), the statement would be false because the ranking number did increase in 2009, 2010, and 2011. The verdict below uses the standard sports phrasing that “ranking went up” means improved.
