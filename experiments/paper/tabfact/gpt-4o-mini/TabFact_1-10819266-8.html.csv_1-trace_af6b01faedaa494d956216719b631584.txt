Conclusion: Verified. In the CSI franchise dataset, the season that premiered on September 22, 2004 has a rank of 21.

Evidence from the database (TabFact, table public.csi_franchise):

1) Identify the season premiere dates and confirm September 22, 2004 exists
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "season premiere" FROM public.csi_franchise ORDER BY "season premiere" ASC;
- Result excerpt:
  • Season: 1, Season Premiere: September 22, 2004
  • Season: 2, Season Premiere: September 28, 2005
  • Season: 3, Season Premiere: September 20, 2006
  • Season: 4, Season Premiere: September 26, 2007
  • Season: 5, Season Premiere: September 24, 2008
  • Season: 6, Season Premiere: September 23, 2009
  • Season: 7, Season Premiere: September 24, 2010
  • Season: 8, Season Premiere: September 23, 2011

2) Retrieve the rank for the season with that premiere date (Season 1)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "season premiere", rank FROM public.csi_franchise WHERE season = 1;
- Result:
  • Season: 1, Season Premiere: September 22, 2004, Rank: 21

3) Cross-check by filtering premieres in 2004 (corroboration)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "season premiere", "tv season", rank FROM public.csi_franchise WHERE "season premiere" LIKE '%2004%';
- Result:
  • Season: 1, Season Premiere: September 22, 2004, TV Season: 2004 - 2005, Rank: 21

Therefore, the claim that the September 22, 2004 season premiere has a rank of 21 is directly supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the CSI franchise record in the available dataset (public.csi_franchise), where “season premiere” is a text date and “rank” is the season’s overall ranking for that TV season.
