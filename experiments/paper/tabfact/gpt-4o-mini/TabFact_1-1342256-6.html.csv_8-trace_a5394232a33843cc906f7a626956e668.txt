Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that there was only one party in a race with candidates “Harry Lane Englebright (R) 57.6%” and “N E West (D) 42.4%.” We verify these details against the available 1942 U.S. House elections data.

Data source exploration
- Tables listing (public schema):
  SQL 1: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  SQL 2: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name ILIKE '%united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942%';
  Evidence: A table named public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 exists.

What the data shows
1) Harry Lane Englebright in 1942
- Query for Englebright:
  SQL: SELECT district, candidates, result 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Englebright%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Harry Lane Englebright%';
- Result: District: California 2; Candidates: Harry Lane Englebright (R) unopposed; Result: Re-elected.
- Full row confirmation:
  SQL: SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE district = 'california 2';
  Result: District: California 2; Incumbent: Harry Lane Englebright; Party: Republican; First Elected: 1926; Candidates: Harry Lane Englebright (R) unopposed; Result: Re-elected.
- Interpretation: Englebright was unopposed in CA-2 in 1942. There were no vote percentages listed and no opponent.

2) N E West and the 57.6% vs 42.4% race
- Query for N E West:
  SQL: SELECT district, candidates, result 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%N E West%' OR candidates ILIKE '%West%';
- Result: District: California 22; Candidates: John J. Phillips (R) 57.6%, N E West (D) 42.4%; Result: New seat Republican gain.
- Full row (table-wide retrieval referenced by tool):
  SQL: SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942;
  Extracted row: District: California 22; Incumbent: None (district created); Party: None (district created); First Elected: None (district created); Candidates: John J. Phillips (R) 57.6%, N E West (D) 42.4%; Result: New seat Republican gain.
- Interpretation: The 57.6% vs 42.4% figures correspond to John J. Phillips (R) vs N E West (D) in California’s 22nd district, not to Englebright.

3) Check for any race listing both Englebright and N E West together
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE candidates LIKE '%Englebright%' AND candidates LIKE '%N E West%';
- Result: No rows.
- Interpretation: Englebright did not face N E West in 1942.

Assessment of the claim
- The claim mentions “only 1 party,” but the percentages (57.6% vs 42.4%) are from a two-party race (Republican vs Democrat) in CA-22 between John J. Phillips and N E West.
- Harry Lane Englebright’s 1942 race (CA-2) was unopposed and had no opponent or percentages. He did not face N E West.
- Therefore, the statement conflates two separate races and incorrectly attributes the 57.6%/42.4% outcome to Englebright.

Conclusion: The available 1942 U.S. House election data contradicts the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the accessible dataset: United States House of Representatives elections, 1942.
- Names are matched literally as “Harry Lane Englebright” and “N E West.” If the claim intended a different year or office, that is outside the present data scope.
