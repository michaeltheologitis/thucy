Claim interpreted
- The statement asserts two paired facts (respectively):
  1) VCA: 40 t (44.1 tons) and a 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer
  2) VCTM: power-to-weight of 28.8 hp/t (25.1 hp/ton) and a 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar

Data sources checked
- Database: TabFact
- Table: tam_tank (columns: vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt)

Executed SQL and results
SQL
SELECT * FROM tam_tank;

Result excerpt (relevant columns/rows):
- Column "vca 155":
  • Row 1: 40t (44.1tons)
  • Row 2: 155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer
- Column vctm:
  • Row 2: 120 mm (4.72in) mortar
  • Row 4: 28.8hp / t (25.1hp / ton)

Verification of each sub-claim
- VCA weight: Data shows 40t (44.1tons). Supported.
- VCA armament: Data shows 155 mm (6.1in) L/41 howitzer. Supported.
- VCTM power-to-weight: Data shows 28.8hp/t (25.1hp/ton). Supported.
- VCTM armament: Data shows 120 mm (4.72in) mortar. Supported.

Conclusion
- All parts of the claim are directly supported by the table contents returned by the executed SQL.

Assumptions
- “Respectively” maps the first pair to the VCA (weight and howitzer) and the second pair to the VCTM (power-to-weight and mortar).
