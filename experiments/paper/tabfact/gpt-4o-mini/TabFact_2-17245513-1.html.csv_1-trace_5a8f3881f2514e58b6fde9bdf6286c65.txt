Claim to verify: “t7 be the place of player peter oosterhuis, who have 10875.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database containing public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf, which holds results for the 1975 U.S. Open Golf Championship. Columns: place, player, country, score, to par, money.

Evidence and queries:
1) Does the table contain Peter Oosterhuis and what is his place and money?
- SQL: SELECT place, player, money FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Oosterhuis%';
- Result: place = t7, player = Peter Oosterhuis, money = 7500

2) Full details for Peter Oosterhuis
- SQL: SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Peter%Oosterhuis%';
- Result: place = T7, player = Peter Oosterhuis, country = England, score = 289 (rounds 69,73,72,75), to par = +5, money = $7500

3) Verify whether any player earned 10,875 in this event
- SQL: SELECT place, player, money FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(money, '$',''), ',', '')::int = 10875;
- Result: No matching rows found

4) Cross-check all T7 finishers and their payouts
- SQL: SELECT player, money FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(place) = LOWER('T7');
- Result: Jack Nicklaus — $7500; Peter Oosterhuis — $7500

Findings:
- Place: Peter Oosterhuis finished T7 at the 1975 U.S. Open. This supports the claim’s place component.
- Money: The database records his payout as $7,500. There is no record of a $10,875 payout for him (or any player) in this table. Thus, the “who have 10875” portion is not supported.

Conclusion:
- The claim’s place is correct (T7 for Peter Oosterhuis), but the stated amount 10875 is incorrect based on the available data, which shows $7,500.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1975 U.S. Open results for Peter Oosterhuis, given the available dataset. “10875” was interpreted as the intended money amount (currency not specified by the user), compared against the table’s money field.
