Claim evaluated: “Gary Unmarried comes on Friday at 8:00 pm.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: gary_unmarried
- Columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision)

Evidence collected
1) Distinct timeslots and counts
- Result: Only “wednesday 8:30 pm” appears, 20 rows.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT timeslot, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM gary_unmarried GROUP BY timeslot;

2) Direct check for any Friday timeslot (including “friday 8:00 pm”)
- Result: No entries found.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE timeslot ILIKE '%friday%' OR timeslot = 'friday 8:00 pm';

3) Day-of-week validation from air dates
- Result: All 20 episodes map to “Wednesday”.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT trim(to_char(to_date("air date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'), 'Day')) AS dow, COUNT(*) FROM public.gary_unmarried GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 2 DESC;

Conclusion
- The available data shows Gary Unmarried aired on Wednesday at 8:30 pm, with no evidence of a Friday 8:00 pm timeslot. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Comes on” is interpreted as the show’s original broadcast timeslot.
- The public.gary_unmarried table is treated as authoritative for the show’s airing schedule represented in the dataset (episodes listed span 2008–2009).
