Conclusion: Verified. The data shows that for the row where position in table = '10th' and the manner of departure contains 'resign', the date of vacancy is 28 February 2011.

Data source exploration
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: t_2010_11_primeira_liga
- Relevant columns: team (text), outgoing head coach (text), manner of departure (text), date of vacancy (text), position in table (text), incoming head coach (text), date of appointment (text)

Supporting evidence
1) Targeted lookup for position = '10th' and departure ≈ 'resign'
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "outgoing head coach", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "position in table" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga 
WHERE "position in table" = '10th' AND "manner of departure" ILIKE '%resign%'

Result:
- Team: Beira - Mar
- Outgoing Head Coach: Leonardo Jardim
- Manner of Departure: Resigned
- Date of Vacancy: 28 February 2011
- Position in Table: 10th

2) Broader check of all rows with manner of departure containing 'resign'
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "outgoing head coach", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "position in table" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga 
WHERE LOWER("manner of departure") LIKE '%resign%'

Relevant subset of results:
- académica | jorge costa | resigned | 21 December 2010 | 9th
- académica | josé guilherme | resigned | 20 February 2011 | 13th
- sporting | paulo sérgio | resigned | 26 February 2011 | 3rd
- beira - mar | leonardo jardim | resigned | 28 February 2011 | 10th

These results confirm that the only row with position in table = 10th and manner of departure containing 'resign' has date of vacancy = 28 February 2011.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “manner of departure be resign” to include the value “resigned” (case-insensitive match) in the manner of departure column.
- Interpreted “position in the table be 10th” as an exact text match to '10th' in the position in table column.
- The context is the 2010–2011 Primeira Liga managerial changes table (t_2010_11_primeira_liga).
