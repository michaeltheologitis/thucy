- Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Maximum laps and ties
- SQL: SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  Result: max_laps = 79
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS driver_count FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix)
  Result: driver_count = 4
- SQL: SELECT driver, constructor FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix)

- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MIN(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
  Result: count = 2
- SQL: SELECT driver, constructor FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MIN(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
