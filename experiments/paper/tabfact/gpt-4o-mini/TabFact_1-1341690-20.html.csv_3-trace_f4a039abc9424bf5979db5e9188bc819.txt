Claim interpreted: The user appears to ask whether Parren Mitchell was re-elected (rather than first elected) for Maryland’s 7th congressional district in 1970.

Data sources discovered:
- Accessible database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns: district, incumbent, party, first elected, result, candidates)

Evidence gathered:
- We queried the 1974 U.S. House elections table for Maryland districts to find the record for Maryland’s 7th district and check the incumbent’s first elected year and the 1974 result.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district ILIKE '%MD%' OR district ILIKE '%Maryland%';

Result excerpt (relevant row):
- district: maryland 7
- incumbent: parren mitchell
- party: democratic
- first elected: 1970
- result: re - elected
- candidates: parren mitchell (d) unopposed

Analysis:
- The dataset shows that Parren Mitchell was “first elected” in 1970 and was “re - elected” in 1974. Therefore, 1970 corresponds to his initial election, not a re-election.

Conclusion:
- Based on the authoritative 1974 elections dataset, Parren Mitchell’s first election to Maryland’s 7th district occurred in 1970, and he was re-elected in 1974. Thus, the claim that he was re-elected in 1970 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing as asking whether Parren Mitchell was re-elected in 1970 (rather than simply elected). The available dataset does not include a 1970 table, but it records “first elected: 1970” for the 1974 incumbent, which is sufficient to determine that 1970 was his first election, not a re-election.
