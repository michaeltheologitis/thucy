Claim to verify: “the highest score for a winning team be 18, while the lowest score for a winning team be 13.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.solheim_cup
- Columns: year (bigint), venue (text), "winning team" (text), score (text), "usa captain" (text), "europe captain" (text)

Step 1: Inspect raw scores to understand format
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "winning team", score FROM public.solheim_cup;
- Observed sample rows (tool output):
  2013 Europe 18 - 10
  2011 Europe 15 - 13
  2005 United States 15½ - 12½
  2003 Europe 17½ - 10½
  1992 Europe 11½ - 6½
  1990 United States 11½ - 4½
  Scores use a hyphen with spaces, and may include half points denoted by the character ½.

Step 2: Parse scores into numeric winning and losing values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "winning team", score,
      CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)), '½', '.5') AS numeric) AS winning_score,
      CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)), '½', '.5') AS numeric) AS losing_score
  FROM public.solheim_cup
  ORDER BY year DESC;
- Key parsed results (tool output excerpt):
  2013 Europe: winning_score 18.0, losing_score 10.0
  2011 Europe: winning_score 15.0, losing_score 13.0
  2005 United States: winning_score 15.5, losing_score 12.5
  2003 Europe: winning_score 17.5, losing_score 10.5
  2000 Europe: winning_score 14.5, losing_score 11.5
  1994 United States: winning_score 13.0, losing_score 7.0
  1992 Europe: winning_score 11.5, losing_score 6.5
  1990 United States: winning_score 11.5, losing_score 4.5

Step 3: Compute highest and lowest winning-team scores
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)), '½', '.5') AS numeric)) AS max_winning_score,
         MIN(CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)), '½', '.5') AS numeric)) AS min_winning_score
  FROM public.solheim_cup;
- Result (tool output):
  max_winning_score = 18
  min_winning_score = 11.5

Step 4: Sanity check that the left side is always the winner’s score
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
  FROM solheim_cup
  WHERE CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1)), '½', '.5') AS numeric) <= CAST(REPLACE(TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)), '½', '.5') AS numeric);
- Result (tool output): 0 rows, confirming the left-side value is always greater than the right-side value.

Conclusion
- The highest score for a winning team in this dataset is 18. This supports the first part of the claim.
- The lowest score for a winning team in this dataset is 11.5 (e.g., 1992 and 1990). This contradicts the second part of the claim, which states 13.

Final determination: The claim is partly incorrect based on the data.

Assumptions
- The left side of the score string represents the winner’s points (validated by Step 4).
- Verification is performed strictly within the provided public.solheim_cup dataset.
- The character ½ is correctly interpreted as 0.5 for numeric comparisons.
