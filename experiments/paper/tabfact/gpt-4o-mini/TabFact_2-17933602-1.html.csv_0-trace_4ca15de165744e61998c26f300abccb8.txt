Claim to verify:
- Rio Ave's head coach is Carlos Brito, and Sporting CP have José Peseiro.

Data source consulted:
- PostgreSQL database, table public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga (Portuguese Primeira Liga 2004–2005 season).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Rio Ave head coach
- Result: club = Rio Ave; head coach = Carlos Brito; city = Vila do Conde; stadium = Estádio dos Arcos
- SQL:
SELECT club, "head coach", city, stadium FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE club ILIKE '%Rio Ave%';

2) Sporting CP head coach
- Result: club = Sporting CP; head coach = José Peseiro
- SQL:
SELECT club, "head coach" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE club ILIKE '%Sporting%';

Assessment:
- Both parts of the claim are supported by the 2004–2005 season dataset: Rio Ave’s head coach is listed as Carlos Brito, and Sporting CP’s head coach is listed as José Peseiro.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 2004–2005 Primeira Liga season (the scope of the available dataset).
- Interpreted “have José Peseiro” to mean “Sporting CP’s head coach is José Peseiro.”
