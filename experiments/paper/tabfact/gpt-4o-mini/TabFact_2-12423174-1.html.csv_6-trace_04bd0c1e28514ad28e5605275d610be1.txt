Claim to verify: “the young african score zero point in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered dataset: PostgreSQL database with table t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs containing two-legged tie results for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
- Table structure (from schema inspection): columns team 1 (text), agg (text), team 2 (text), 1st leg (text), 2nd leg (text). This indicates knockout ties recorded by two legs and an aggregate score; there is no concept of “points” recorded in this table.

Evidence from the data
1) Search for fixtures involving Young Africans (broad LIKE search)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%young%' OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%young%';
Result (key fields):
- Team 1: Young Africans
- Team 2: Lavori Publici
- 1st leg: 2 - 0
- 2nd leg: 0 - 0
- Aggregate (agg): 2 - 0

2) Exact-match confirmation for “Young Africans”
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE LOWER("team 1") = 'young africans' OR LOWER("team 2") = 'young africans';
Result:
- Team 1: Young Africans
- Team 2: Lavori Publici
- 1st leg: 2 - 0
- 2nd leg: 0 - 0
- Aggregate: 2 - 0

Analysis
- The dataset shows Young Africans contested at least one two-legged tie in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs and won it 2–0 on aggregate (2–0 first leg, 0–0 second leg). This demonstrates they scored goals (2 total) and advanced in that tie.
- The competition’s recording in this dataset is by two-legged knockout ties (1st leg, 2nd leg, aggregate). There is no notion of “points” here. Even if “points” were informally intended to mean “goals,” the data shows Young Africans did not have zero; they scored two.

Conclusion
- The claim that “Young African(s) scored zero point in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs” is contradicted by the recorded tie where Young Africans won 2–0 on aggregate.

Assumptions made
- “young african” refers to Young Africans SC (Tanzania).
- “score zero point” was interpreted as either “earned zero points” (not applicable to this knockout format) or “scored zero goals.” In either interpretation, the recorded result (2–0 aggregate) demonstrates the claim is false.
