Claim to verify: “darryl dawkins play for the jazz 7 year before paul dawkins.”

Data source overview
- Available database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, "years for jazz", "school / club team")

Evidence
1) Identify the Utah Jazz seasons for Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins
SQL executed:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower(player) IN ('darryl dawkins', 'paul dawkins');
Result:
- Darryl Dawkins — Years for Jazz: 1987 - 88
- Paul Dawkins — Years for Jazz: 1979 - 80

Corroborating lookup (name pattern search)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE lower(player) LIKE '%dawk%';
Result:
- Darryl Dawkins — 1987 - 88
- Paul Dawkins — 1979 - 80

2) Compute the difference in their start years (Darryl minus Paul)
SQL executed:
WITH dawkins AS (
  SELECT player, CAST(substring("years for jazz" FROM '^[0-9]{4}') AS int) AS start_year
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE lower(player) IN ('darryl dawkins','paul dawkins')
)
SELECT 
  MAX(CASE WHEN lower(player)='darryl dawkins' THEN start_year END) AS darryl_start,
  MAX(CASE WHEN lower(player)='paul dawkins' THEN start_year END) AS paul_start,
  (MAX(CASE WHEN lower(player)='darryl dawkins' THEN start_year END) - MAX(CASE WHEN lower(player)='paul dawkins' THEN start_year END)) AS darryl_minus_paul
FROM dawkins;
Result:
- Darryl start year: 1987
- Paul start year: 1979
- Difference (Darryl minus Paul): 8 years (Darryl started 8 years after Paul)

Conclusion
- The data shows Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz in 1979–80, and Darryl Dawkins played in 1987–88. Therefore, Darryl did not play for the Jazz 7 years before Paul; instead, he started 8 years after Paul. The claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Jazz” refers to the Utah Jazz NBA franchise.
- “before” is evaluated by comparing the players’ Jazz start seasons as recorded in the roster table.
- Player name entries in the roster correspond to the known NBA players Darryl Dawkins and Paul Dawkins.
