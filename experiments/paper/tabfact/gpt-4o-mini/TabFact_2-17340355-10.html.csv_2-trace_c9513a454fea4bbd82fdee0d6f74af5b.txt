Summary
- Interpreted claim within the available data environment: the database contains the 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season table. I verified whether the Suns’ game at the Target Center occurred after their game at the FedExForum by querying this season’s game logs for those venues and comparing dates.

Data source discovery
- Available source: public schema with table t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.

Schema overview
- Columns (from schema inspection):
  - game (bigint): unique game identifier
  - date (text): game date (string, month-day format)
  - team (text): team
  - location attendance (text): venue and attendance info
  - record (text): team record

Evidence
1) Query to find both venues and order by date
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Target%' OR "location attendance" ILIKE '%FedEx%'
ORDER BY date ASC;

Result:
- Game: 79, Date: April 10, Location Attendance: FedExForum 15908
- Game: 80, Date: April 11, Location Attendance: Target Center 18478

Conclusion
- The game at the Target Center (Game 80, April 11) took place after the game at the FedExForum (Game 79, April 10). Both the chronological dates and the sequential game IDs confirm this ordering.

Assumptions
- “The game” refers to games in the available dataset (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season).
- “After” means chronologically later within the season, as represented by the date field and corroborated by the sequential game ID.
