Claim interpreted: "On July 13th, set 3 be 12 - 25."

Data source consulted
- Database: TabFact
- Table: t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification
  - Columns (text): date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total

Step 1 — Inspect date formatting
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification;
- Result:
  - 13 jul
  - 14 jul
  - 15 jul

Step 2 — Retrieve all matches on July 13
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3" 
  FROM t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification 
  WHERE date = '13 jul';
- Results:
  1) date: 13 jul | score: 0 - 3 | set 1: 9 - 25 | set 2: 17 - 25 | set 3: 12 - 25
  2) date: 13 jul | score: 3 - 0 | set 1: 25 - 23 | set 2: 25 - 10 | set 3: 25 - 13

Supplementary check — Alternative date pattern (no rows found)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3" 
  FROM t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification 
  WHERE date LIKE '%July 13%';
- Result: 0 rows (confirms the table uses the '13 jul' format)

Findings
- There are two matches recorded on 13 jul. In one of them, set 3 is exactly 12 - 25, which matches the claim. In the other match that same day, set 3 is 25 - 13.

Conclusion
- The statement "on July 13th, set 3 be 12 - 25" is true for at least one match on that date in the dataset, but it is not universally true for all matches on that date.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to whether any set 3 on July 13 matches 12 - 25 within this table.
- Interpreted "July 13th" as the date format stored as '13 jul' in the dataset.
