Claim to verify: "lauren gussis be not a writer for dexter" (interpreted as: Lauren Gussis is not a writer for the TV series Dexter.)

Data source discovery:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a table: dexter_season_3.
- Schema inspection shows dexter_season_3 has columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, us viewers (millions).

Evidence from data (episode writing credits in dexter_season_3):
- I queried the dexter_season_3 table for any episodes where the written by field contains "Gussis" (case-insensitive). The database returned two matching episodes, crediting Lauren Gussis as writer or co-writer.

Query and results:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by" 
FROM public.dexter_season_3 
WHERE LOWER("written by") LIKE LOWER('%Gussis%');

- Returned rows:
  - No in Series: 31; No in Season: 7; Title: easy as pie; Written By: lauren gussis
  - No in Series: 35; No in Season: 11; Title: i had a dream; Written By: charles h eglee and lauren gussis

Assessment:
- The connected, authoritative data source shows Lauren Gussis is credited as the writer of at least one episode and co-writer of another episode of Dexter (Season 3). Therefore, the claim that she is not a writer for Dexter is contradicted by the data.

Verdict: Inaccurate

Assumptions:
- "Dexter" refers to the TV series that aired 2006–2013 on Showtime.
- "Writer" means credited as writer on any episode of the series. Evidence from Season 3 alone is sufficient to refute the claim.
- The database table dexter_season_3 accurately reflects official episode credits for that season.
