Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct venues present (to confirm Lake Oval is included)

FROM t_1961_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue;
Result excerpt: Lake Oval (1), MCG (1), Victoria Park (1), Kardinia Park (1), Glenferrie Oval (1), Arden Street Oval (1).

2) Match with the highest crowd in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM t_1961_vfl_season
ORDER BY crowd DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result: {date: "3 june 1961", home team: "melbourne", away team: "carlton", venue: "mcg", crowd: 49678}

SQL:
SELECT MAX(crowd) FROM t_1961_vfl_season;
Result: {max: 49678}

3) Lake Oval matches and attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE lower(venue) LIKE '%lake oval%';

FROM t_1961_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY total_crowd DESC;
Results mirror the max-crowd listing above, with MCG highest; Lake Oval totals 14500.

Conclusion
- The available data shows the highest attendance in the 1961 VFL season (as represented in this dataset) occurred at the MCG, not Lake Oval. Lake Oval’s top/total attendance in this data is below several other venues.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Interpreted “highest crowd participation” as highest single-match attendance (and also checked total attendance per venue) within the 1961 VFL season data available in t_1961_vfl_season.
- The table contains matches dated 3 June 1961; conclusions are strictly grounded in this dataset, which we treat as authoritative for what it contains.
