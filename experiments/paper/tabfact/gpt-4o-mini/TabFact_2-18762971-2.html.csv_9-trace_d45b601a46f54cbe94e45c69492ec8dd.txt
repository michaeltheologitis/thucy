Claim being checked: “the shortest time between 2 consecutive match in March be 2 day.”

Summary of finding: The shortest gap between consecutive matches in March (in the available dataset) is 3 days, not 2 days.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (columns: date text, opponent text, venue text, result text, attendance bigint)

Evidence and queries:
1) List all March matches, ordered, with day gaps between consecutive March matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance,
       (to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') - LAG(to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY')) OVER (ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY'))) AS day_difference
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY')) = 3
ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY');

Result (dates and day gaps):
- 3 March 2001 — previous: N/A
- 7 March 2001 — gap: 4 days
- 10 March 2001 — gap: 3 days
- 17 March 2001 — gap: 7 days
- 24 March 2001 — gap: 7 days

2) Compute the minimum gap in March
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(day_difference) as min_difference
FROM (
    SELECT (to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') - LAG(to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY')) OVER (ORDER BY to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY'))) AS day_difference
    FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
    WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY')) = 3
) AS differences;

Result: min_difference = 3 days

Conclusion: The data shows the shortest time between two consecutive March matches is 3 days. Therefore, the claim that it is 2 days is not supported.

Assumptions:
- “Match in March” is interpreted as matches whose dates fall in March within the available season table.
- “Shortest time between 2 consecutive match in March” refers to the minimum difference in days between consecutive matches after filtering to March dates only.
