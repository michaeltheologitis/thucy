Summary of the claim
Claim: “Olga Govortsova has never reached the final in a Grand Slam tournament.”

Available data sources and structure
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with a single relevant table: olga_govortsova.
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - Columns: tournament (text), "2007" (text), "2008" (text), "2009" (text), "2010" (text), "2011" (text)
  - Interpretation: Each row is a tournament category or tournament name; each year column stores the round/result code for that year.

Executed evidence queries (with exact SQL) and results
1) Purpose: Inspect all rows to understand what Grand Slam data exists and its coverage.
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011"
FROM public.olga_govortsova;
Key Grand Slam-related rows returned (verbatim values as provided by the dataset):
- australian open: 2007=a, 2008=1r, 2009=1r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r
- french open: 2007=a, 2008=3r, 2009=3r, 2010=2r, 2011=2r
- wimbledon: 2007=2r, 2008=1r, 2009=2r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r
- us open: 2007=2r, 2008=2r, 2009=1r, 2010=1r, 2011=1r
(Additional rows confirm this table also lists other tournament categories and year-end rankings, indicating it is a singles results summary.)

2) Purpose: Explicitly filter for the four Grand Slams only (confirmation).
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011"
FROM public.olga_govortsova
WHERE tournament IN ('australian open','french open','wimbledon','us open');
Results (consistent with Query 1):
- No entries indicate an appearance in a Final (e.g., no codes like F or W) across 2007–2011; best results are 3R at the French Open (2008, 2009) and 2R in other events/years.

Findings
- Within the available dataset (which captures singles performances for 2007–2011), Olga Govortsova did not reach a Grand Slam singles final. Her best recorded results in this period are third-round appearances at the French Open (2008 and 2009).

Limitations and impact on the claim
- The dataset covers years 2007–2011 only and appears to reflect singles results. It does not include later career years (e.g., post-2011) or doubles/mixed doubles results. Therefore, while the evidence supports that she did not reach a Grand Slam singles final during 2007–2011, it does not, by itself, conclusively prove she never reached a Grand Slam final at any time or in any discipline.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data, Olga Govortsova did not reach a Grand Slam singles final during 2007–2011. However, due to limited temporal and event-type coverage, the absolute claim (“never reached the final in a grand slam tournament”) cannot be fully verified from this dataset alone.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity/limitations)
- The table olga_govortsova reflects singles main-draw results (as implied by round codes and the presence of year-end rankings).
- No additional tables with doubles/mixed doubles or post-2011 data are accessible within the current data environment.
