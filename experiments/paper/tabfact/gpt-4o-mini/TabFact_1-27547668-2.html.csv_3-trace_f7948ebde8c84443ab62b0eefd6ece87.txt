Claim interpreted: There are 3 different directors who each directed 2 episodes.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (columns include: title, directed by, written by, viewers, original airdate, prod code).

Method:
- Treat each row as an episode and the "directed by" field as the director name for that episode.
- Verify whether any episodes list multiple directors; if not, counts by the "directed by" field reflect per-director episode counts.
- Count directors with exactly 2 episodes and list their names.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Total number of episodes
- Result: 10
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes;

2) Directors with their episode counts (top by frequency)
- Result (name -> count):
  - Mike Clattenburg -> 2
  - Steve DiMarco (also displayed earlier as Steve Dimarco) -> 2
  - Robert Lieberman -> 2
  - Jerry Ciccoritti -> 1
  - Larry McLean -> 1
  - Phil Earnshaw -> 1
  - Steve Scaini -> 1
- SQL: SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes GROUP BY "directed by" ORDER BY count DESC LIMIT 50;

3) Sanity check for multiple-director entries in the field
- Result: 0 episodes list multiple directors using comma, " and ", "&", or "/".
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" LIKE '%,%' OR "directed by" LIKE '% and %' OR "directed by" LIKE '%&%' OR "directed by" LIKE '%/%';

4) List directors who directed exactly 2 episodes
- Result: Steve DiMarco; Mike Clattenburg; Robert Lieberman
- SQL: SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes GROUP BY "directed by" HAVING COUNT(*) = 2;

5) Count of distinct directors who directed exactly 2 episodes
- Result: 3
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS director_count FROM ( SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes GROUP BY "directed by" HAVING COUNT(*) = 2 ) AS subquery;

Conclusion: The data shows exactly 3 distinct directors each directed 2 episodes, which matches the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available dataset (Republic of Doyle episodes) and counts each row as one episode credited to the single director named in the "directed by" field. A sanity check confirmed no multi-director entries under common delimiters, so per-field counts accurately reflect per-director episode counts.
