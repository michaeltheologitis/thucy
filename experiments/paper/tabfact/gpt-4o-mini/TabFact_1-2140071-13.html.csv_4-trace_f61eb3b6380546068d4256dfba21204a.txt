Summary of findings
- The database contains a TV series table (public.made_tv_series) with episode metadata, including coach names, premiere dates, and an external link field.
- Episode 10 (Season 13) premiered on October 10, 2012, with coach listed as Chris and the external link listed as Full episode.
- Episode 11 (Season 13) premiered on October 11, 2012, with coach listed as Katie Kansas and the external link listed as Full episode.
- Therefore, the claim that “Katie Kansa” was the coach for Episode 10 that premiered on October 11, 2012 is incorrect on both the coach and the date. The presence of a “Full episode” external link is true for both episodes in the data. The correct spelling in the data is “Katie Kansas.”

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Table structure confirmation
- Columns in public.made_tv_series:
  - season (bigint), episode (bigint), episode summary (text), premier date (text), external link (text), coach (text)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'made_tv_series' AND table_schema = 'public';

  SELECT a.attname AS column_name, c.conname AS constraint_name 
  FROM pg_constraint AS c 
  JOIN pg_attribute AS a ON a.attnum = ANY(c.conkey) 
  JOIN pg_class AS t ON c.conrelid = t.oid 
  WHERE t.relname = 'made_tv_series' AND c.contype = 'p';

2) Exact record for Season 13, Episode 10
- Result: season=13, episode=10, premier date=October 10, 2012, coach=Chris, external link=Full episode
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "external link" 
  FROM public.made_tv_series 
  WHERE season = 13 AND episode = 10;

3) Exact record for Season 13, Episode 11
- Result: season=13, episode=11, premier date=October 11, 2012, coach=Katie Kansas, external link=Full episode
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "external link" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE season = 13 AND episode = 11;

4) Episodes in October 2012 (context)
- Results include:
  - S13E10: October 10, 2012 — coach: chris — external link: full episode
  - S13E11: October 11, 2012 — coach: katie kansas — external link: full episode
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "premier date", coach, "external link"
  FROM public.made_tv_series 
  WHERE "premier date" ILIKE '%October%2012%';

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “Katie Kansa be the coach in episode 10” — Not supported. Data shows coach is Chris for S13E10. For S13E11 (the following day), the coach is “Katie Kansas.”
- “premier on October 11, 2012” — Not supported for episode 10. S13E10 premiered on October 10, 2012. October 11, 2012 is the premiere date for S13E11.
- “have full episode external link” — Supported. The external link field for both S13E10 and S13E11 is “Full episode.”

Conclusion
- The episode number and coach assignment in the claim are incorrect relative to the data, and the date given applies to episode 11, not episode 10. The existence of a “Full episode” external link is correct.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to entries in the public.made_tv_series table as authoritative for episode number, premiere date, coach, and presence of an external link.
- “Katie Kansa” is interpreted as “Katie Kansas,” matching the spelling found in the data for S13E11.
- “Have full episode external link” is interpreted as the external link field containing the value “Full episode,” as stored in the table.
