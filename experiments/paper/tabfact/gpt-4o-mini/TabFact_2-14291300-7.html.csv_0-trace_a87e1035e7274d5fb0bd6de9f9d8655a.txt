Claim interpreted: “The Toronto Maple Leafs are the only opponent associated with 63 points.” I verify this against the available database.

Data source discovery
- Finding: Only one user table is available: public.my_info_table.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

Schema inspection
- public.my_info_table columns:
  - game (bigint)
  - march (bigint)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)
  - record (text)
  - points (bigint)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'my_info_table';

Evidence
1) Identify all rows where points = 63
- Result: One row, opponent = "toronto maple leafs" (game 68, march 13, score 3 - 2, record 25 - 30 - 13, points 63)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE points = 63 ORDER BY game ASC;

2) Count distinct opponents with points = 63
- Result: 1
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS distinct_opponents_count 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE points = 63;

3) List all rows for opponent = 'toronto maple leafs' for context
- Result:
  - Game 68, March 13, Score 3 - 2, Record 25 - 30 - 13, Points 63
  - Game 71, March 21, Score 1 - 1, Record 26 - 31 - 14, Points 66
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, march, score, record, points 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE opponent = 'toronto maple leafs' 
  ORDER BY game;

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one row where points = 63, and the opponent in that row is "toronto maple leafs." Therefore, within this data, the Toronto Maple Leafs are the only opponent associated with 63 points.

Assumptions
- “Opponent with 63 point” is interpreted as: in public.my_info_table, the only game record where the points column equals 63 has opponent = "toronto maple leafs."
- Verification is limited strictly to the provided table; no external season or league data was used.
