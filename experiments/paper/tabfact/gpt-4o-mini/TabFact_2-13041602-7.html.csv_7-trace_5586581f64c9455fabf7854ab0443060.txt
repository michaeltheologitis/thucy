Claim to verify: “there be 10 game in the 2005 milwaukee brewer season where 1 team score no point.”

Summary of findings based on available data
- The only accessible dataset is a single table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season.
- This table contains 27 rows and covers only September games from the 2005 season (not the full season).
- Within this September dataset, there are 4 games where either the Brewers or their opponent scored 0 runs.
- Because the dataset is limited to September, it does not support the claim of 10 such games for the entire 2005 season.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Table schema (columns)
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season' 
AND table_schema = 'public';
Result (abridged): date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

2) Row count
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: 27

3) Month coverage in the table (to verify scope)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT split_part(date, ' ', 1) AS month FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY month;
Result: September (only)

4) Distinct dates present (to confirm September coverage)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY date;
Result: september 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30

5) Count of games with a shutout (0 runs by either team) in this dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shutout_count
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 1)::int = 0
   OR split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 2)::int = 0;
Result: 4

6) List of those shutout games (for transparency)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score,
       split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 1)::int AS brewers_runs,
       split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 2)::int AS opp_runs
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 1)::int = 0
   OR split_part(split_part(score, ' (', 1), ' - ', 2)::int = 0
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- September 17 vs Astros, Score 0 - 7 (Brewers 0, Opp 7)
- September 22 vs Cubs, Score 0 - 3 (Brewers 0, Opp 3)
- September 25 vs Cardinals, Score 0 - 2 (Brewers 0, Opp 2)
- September 29 vs Reds, Score 2 - 0 (Brewers 2, Opp 0)

Conclusion
- The available authoritative data only covers September 2005 and shows 4 shutout games. It does not support the claim of 10 such games for the entire 2005 season. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence we have.

Assumptions made
- The score field is interpreted as “Brewers runs – Opponent runs,” with any extra-innings detail in parentheses removed for parsing. This aligns with opponent/losing pitcher indications in the sample rows.
- The table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season represents only the September portion of the 2005 season; no additional 2005 games are available in the connected data source.
