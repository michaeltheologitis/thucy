Claim: “the zakspeed 861 chassis be make in the year 1986 and 1987.”

Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and located a relevant table.
- Inspected the schema to understand available fields.
- Queried the data to check which years list the Zakspeed 861 chassis.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a public.zakspeed table.
  - Evidence (SQL executed by tool):
    1) SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables;
    2) SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_name = 'zakspeed';
  - Result: Table public.zakspeed exists.

Schema details
- Table: public.zakspeed
- Columns (from information_schema.columns):
  - year (bigint)
  - chassis (text)
  - engine (s) (text)
  - tyres (text)
  - points (bigint)

Evidence queries and results
1) Check rows where chassis mentions 861
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis LIKE '%861%';
- Result rows:
  - 1986 | zakspeed 861 | zakspeed s4 t / c | g | 0
  - 1987 | zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | zakspeed s4 t / c | g | 2
- Distinct years (SQL):
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis LIKE '%861%';
- Result: 1986, 1987
- Distinct chassis with years (SQL):
  SELECT DISTINCT chassis, year FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis LIKE '%861%';
- Result:
  - zakspeed 861 | 1986
  - zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | 1987

2) Cross-check entries for 1986 and 1987
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year IN (1986, 1987);
- Results:
  - 1986: chassis = “zakspeed 861”
  - 1987: chassis = “zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871”

Interpretation
- The dataset shows the Zakspeed 861 chassis associated with the 1986 season and also appearing in 1987 (alongside the 871). This supports that the 861 chassis was fielded in both 1986 and 1987.

Conclusion
- The evidence supports the claim that the Zakspeed 861 chassis is present in both 1986 and 1987 entries in the dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be make” as “was fielded/used in competition” for the given year(s), since the dataset tracks per-year chassis usage rather than manufacturing/production dates.
