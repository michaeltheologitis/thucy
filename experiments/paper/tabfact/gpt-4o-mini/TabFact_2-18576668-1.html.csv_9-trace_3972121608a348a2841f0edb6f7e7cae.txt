Data source discovered: tsuyoshi_fujita (public schema)
- Single table: tsuyoshi_fujita
- Columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)

Date field inspection
- Sample values indicate the year appears at the end of the date string (e.g., "10 - 12 june 2011").
SQL executed:
SELECT date, season FROM tsuyoshi_fujita LIMIT 20;
Sample result excerpt:
- 4 - 5 july 1998 | 1997 - 98
- 16 - 17 january 1999 | 1998 - 99
- ...

Primary verification: count events in 2011 (robust year extraction)
- Approach: Extract the trailing 4-digit year via regex and match 2011.
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_events
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE date ~ E'([0-9]{4})$' AND substring(date from '([0-9]{4})$') = '2011';
Result: total_events = 1

Detail listing for 2011
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "event type", location, format, season, rank
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE substring(date from '([0-9]{4})$') = '2011';
Result (1 row):
- Date: 10 - 12 june 2011; Event Type: pro tour; Location: nagoya; Format: block constructed and booster draft; Season: [corresponding season]; Rank: 5

Cross-check: substring search for 2011 anywhere
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, date, "event type", location
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE date ILIKE '%2011%'
GROUP BY date, "event type", location;
Result: 1 row (same event as above)

Note on a brittle method (discarded)
- A naive approach using the last 4 characters returned 0 due to potential spacing/format issues at the string end.
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS event_count
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE SUBSTRING(date, -4) = '2011';
Result: event_count = 0
- This was superseded by the regex-based extraction shown above, which reliably found 1 event in 2011.

Conclusion
- The database records 1 event in calendar year 2011, not 10. Therefore, the claim "there be 10 event in 2011" is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "event" refers to rows in the tsuyoshi_fujita table, each representing an event entry.
- "in 2011" refers to the calendar year extracted from the trailing 4-digit year in the date text field.
