What I checked
- Interpreted the claim as referring to Se Ri Pak’s results at the Women’s British Open, based on the available data source.
- Verified whether she was champion in 2001 and finished 2nd two years later (2003).

Evidence from the data
- 2001 Women’s British Open: Champion = Se Ri Pak; Runner-up = Mi Hyun Kim; Venue = Sunningdale GC; Score = 277 (−11); Margin = 2.
- 2003 Women’s British Open: Champion = Annika Sörenstam; Runner-up = Se Ri Pak; Venue = Royal Lytham & St Annes; Score = 278 (−10); Margin = 1.

Executed SQL (as returned by the data tool)
1) Champions and runners-up for 2001 and 2003:
SELECT year, champion, "runner (s) - up" FROM women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2001, 2003) ORDER BY year;

2) Full details for 2001 and 2003:
SELECT * FROM women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2001, 2003);

Conclusion
- The data shows Se Ri Pak was the champion in 2001 and was runner-up (2nd place) in 2003, which is two years later. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the Women’s British Open, as this is the authoritative dataset available in the connected data sources.
