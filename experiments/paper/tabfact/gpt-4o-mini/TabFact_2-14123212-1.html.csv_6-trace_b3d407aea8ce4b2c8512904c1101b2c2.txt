Claim to verify: "the translator be class d and c"

Step 1 — Data sources explored
- Discovered available data source: a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table whlp. (Tool: discover_data_sources)

Step 2 — Understand schema
- Table public.whlp columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (double precision), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text). No primary/foreign keys. (Tool: schema_query)

Step 3 — Evidence from data
A. Distinct class values and counts
- Result: Only class 'd' appears; count = 6.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT class, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.whlp
  GROUP BY class
  ORDER BY count DESC;

B. All rows (to inspect translator-like call signs and class values)
- Result (6 rows):
  w221by | d | fcc
  w223au | d | fcc
  w240bj | d | fcc
  w264bf | d | fcc
  w276bm | d | fcc
  w293al | d | fcc
- Total row count: 6
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", "class", "fcc info" FROM public.whlp ORDER BY "call sign";
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp;

C. Check for explicit mention of "translator" in fcc info
- Result: 0 rows contain the term "translator" in fcc info.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.whlp WHERE "fcc info" ILIKE '%translator%';
  SELECT "class", COUNT(*) AS class_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "fcc info" ILIKE '%translator%' GROUP BY "class";
  SELECT DISTINCT "class" FROM public.whlp WHERE "fcc info" ILIKE '%translator%';

Assessment
- The call signs (e.g., W221BY, W223AU, etc.) match the pattern typically used by FM translators, and every record in this dataset has class = 'd'.
- There are no records with class 'c'.
- Therefore, within the available data, translators are represented only as class 'd' and not as both 'd' and 'c'.

Conclusion
- The claim that "the translator be class d and c" is not supported by the data. In this dataset, translators are class 'd' only; no occurrence of class 'c' exists.

Assumptions
- "translator" refers to the FM translator-like entries represented in public.whlp based on the call sign patterns. 
- Class comparisons are case-insensitive (dataset stores 'd' in lowercase).
