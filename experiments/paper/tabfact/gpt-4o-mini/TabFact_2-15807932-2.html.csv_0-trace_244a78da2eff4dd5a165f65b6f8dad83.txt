Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the relevant schema.
- Queried the medal table to test whether any nation has exactly 1 gold and a rank smaller than 2 (i.e., rank = 1).
- Corroborated by listing the rank-1 entry to check its gold count.

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema with table t_1967_world_judo_championships (medal table for the 1967 World Judo Championships).

Schema details (public.t_1967_world_judo_championships)
- Columns: rank (bigint), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)
- Rank represents country ranking; nation is the country; gold/silver/bronze are medal counts; total is total medals.

Evidence 1: Count nations with gold = 1 and rank < 2
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS nation_count 
  FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships 
  WHERE gold = 1 AND rank < 2;
- Result: 0 nations

Evidence 2: List entries with rank < 2
- SQL executed:
  SELECT nation, rank, gold, silver, bronze, total 
  FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships 
  WHERE rank < 2;
- Result:
  - Nation: Japan; Rank: 1; Gold: 5; Silver: 3; Bronze: 4; Total: 12

Conclusion
- The data show no country with exactly 1 gold and a rank smaller than 2. The sole rank-1 nation (Japan) has 5 golds, not 1. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “country” as the nation field in the t_1967_world_judo_championships table.
- Interpreted “rank smaller than 2” as rank = 1.
- Verification is limited to the 1967 World Judo Championships dataset available in the connected data source.
