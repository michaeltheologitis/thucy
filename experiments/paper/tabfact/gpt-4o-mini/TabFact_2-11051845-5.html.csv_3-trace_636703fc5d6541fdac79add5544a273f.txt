Claim to verify: “Globular clusters have less apparent magnitude than irregular galaxies.”

Interpretation note: On the astronomical magnitude scale, a lower (more negative/smaller) apparent magnitude number means a brighter object. I interpret “less apparent magnitude” to mean a numerically smaller apparent magnitude (i.e., brighter).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
- Relevant columns: “object type” (text), “apparent magnitude” (double precision), plus identifiers and positions.

Evidence from the data
1) Identify object types present
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "object type" FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 ORDER BY "object type" ASC;
- Result (distinct values):
  - globular cluster
  - irregular galaxy
  - spiral galaxy

2) Retrieve apparent magnitudes for globular clusters and irregular galaxies
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE "object type" IN ('globular cluster', 'irregular galaxy')
  ORDER BY "object type", "ngc number";
- Results:
  - NGC 5466 | Globular Cluster | 10.5
  - NGC 5408 | Irregular Galaxy | 14.0
  - NGC 5477 | Irregular Galaxy | 14.5

3) Aggregate comparison (count, min, max, average apparent magnitude)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_apparent_magnitude,
         MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_apparent_magnitude, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_apparent_magnitude
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  WHERE "object type" IN ('globular cluster', 'irregular galaxy')
  GROUP BY "object type";
- Results:
  - globular cluster: count=1, min=10.5, max=10.5, avg=10.5
  - irregular galaxy: count=2, min=14.0, max=14.5, avg=14.25

Assessment
- In this dataset (NGC objects 5001–6000), the globular cluster (NGC 5466) has apparent magnitude 10.5, while the irregular galaxies (NGC 5408, NGC 5477) have magnitudes 14.0 and 14.5. Since smaller magnitude values indicate brighter objects, the globular cluster indeed has a lower (numerically smaller) apparent magnitude than the irregular galaxies in this table.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope
- “Less apparent magnitude” is interpreted as a numerically smaller apparent magnitude (brighter object).
- Verification is limited to the available table (NGC 5001–6000 subset). Broader generalization beyond this dataset is not assessed here.
