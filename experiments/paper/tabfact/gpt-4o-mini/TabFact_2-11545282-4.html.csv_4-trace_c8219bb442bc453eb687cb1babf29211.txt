Claim to verify: “the jazz have at least 3 guard that be on the team 1979 - 80.”

Summary conclusion: Verified. The database shows at least three players with a guard position who were on the Utah Jazz in the 1979–80 season: Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, and Greg Deane. Additional queries also show Adrian Dantley listed as “Guard - Forward” beginning 1979, but the claim is already satisfied with three clear guards from that season.

Data discovery
- Tool: information_schema and pg_catalog table scan
- Result: Located table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
- Executed SQL:
1) From information_schema.tables
SELECT table_name, table_schema
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name ILIKE '%jazz%' OR table_name ILIKE '%roster%' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';

2) From pg_catalog.pg_tables
SELECT tablename AS table_name, schemaname AS table_schema
FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables
WHERE tablename ILIKE '%jazz%' OR tablename ILIKE '%roster%';

Schema check
- Columns in public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster:
  • player (text)
  • nationality (text)
  • position (text)
  • years for jazz (text)
  • school / club team (text)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'utah_jazz_all_time_roster' AND table_schema = 'public';

Evidence queries
A) Confirm formatting around 1979/1980
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%'
LIMIT 50;
- Example results included:
  • Brad Davis | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Paul Dawkins | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Greg Deane | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Adrian Dantley | Guard - Forward | 1979 - 86

B) Strictly list guards whose years explicitly include the single season string “1979 - 80” (or “1979-80”)
- Executed SQL (list):
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE position ILIKE '%guard%'
AND ("years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979 - 80%' OR "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979-80%');
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE position ILIKE '%guard%'
AND ("years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979 - 80%' OR "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979-80%');
- Results:
  • Brad Davis | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Paul Dawkins | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Greg Deane | Guard | 1979 - 80
  Count = 3

C) Broader inclusion (players whose tenure started in 1979 or ended in 1980), still requiring guard in position
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player, position, "years for jazz"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE ("years for jazz" ILIKE '1979 %' OR "years for jazz" ILIKE '% - 80')
AND position ILIKE '%guard%'
ORDER BY player;
- Results:
  • Adrian Dantley | Guard - Forward | 1979 - 86
  • Brad Davis | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Greg Deane | Guard | 1979 - 80
  • Paul Dawkins | Guard | 1979 - 80

Final assessment
- The strict single-season match already identifies three guards (Davis, Dawkins, Deane) for 1979–80, meeting the “at least 3” threshold. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “the jazz” refers to the NBA Utah Jazz franchise.
- “guard” includes any player whose position text contains the substring “guard” (e.g., “Guard”, “Guard - Forward”).
- “on the team 1979 - 80” is interpreted as playing for the Jazz during the 1979–80 NBA season, evidenced by the "years for jazz" field containing the single-season string '1979 - 80' or by inclusive ranges that encompass that season.
