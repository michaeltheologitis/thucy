Interpretation of the claim:
The user appears to claim that the final score for a game at Giants Stadium where the Chicago Bears were the visiting team was 26–21.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
  - Columns: date (text), visiting team (text), final score (text), host team (text), stadium (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Identify all Sunday Night Football games played at a stadium with “Giants” in the name (to capture “Giants Stadium”):
Executed SQL:
SELECT stadium, date, "visiting team", "host team", "final score" 
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present 
WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Giants%';

Result (summarized):
- Stadium: Giants Stadium | Date: September 10 | Visiting Team: Indianapolis Colts | Host Team: New York Giants | Final Score: 26 - 21
- Stadium: Giants Stadium | Date: November 12 | Visiting Team: Chicago Bears      | Host Team: New York Giants | Final Score: 38 - 20

2) Confirm the specific Chicago Bears visiting entry:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score" 
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present 
WHERE "visiting team" ILIKE '%Chicago Bears%';

Result (summarized):
- Date: November 12 | Visiting Team: Chicago Bears | Host Team: New York Giants | Stadium: Giants Stadium | Final Score: 38 - 20

3) Verify which game at Giants Stadium had the final score 26–21:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score" 
FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present
WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Giants%' 
AND "final score" = '26 - 21';

Result (summarized):
- Date: September 10 | Visiting Team: Indianapolis Colts | Host Team: New York Giants | Stadium: Giants Stadium | Final Score: 26 - 21

Conclusion:
Within the authoritative Sunday Night Football (NBC) dataset (2006–present), there is no game at Giants Stadium where the Chicago Bears were the visiting team and the final score was 26–21. The Chicago Bears’ SNF visit to Giants Stadium (Nov 12) ended 38–20. A 26–21 game at Giants Stadium did occur, but it was Colts at Giants, not Bears at Giants.

Assumptions:
- “Giant stadium” refers to Giants Stadium (East Rutherford, NJ).
- Verification is performed against the available dataset of NBC Sunday Night Football results (2006–present), treated as accurate and complete within its scope.
