Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the series leader David Lelay (FRA) was also the winner of the Tour du Haut Var.

Data sources explored:
- Database: cycling_db
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup (columns: date, event, winner, team, series leader)

Key evidence from the data:
1) Tour du Haut Var entry (to determine winner and series leader for that event)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * 
FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup 
WHERE event = 'Tour du Haut Var';
Result summary:
- Date: February 24
- Event: Tour du Haut Var
- Winner: Davide Rebellin (ITA)
- Series Leader: Rinaldo Nocentini (ITA)

2) Full list of events and winners (to validate context and other winners)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, event, winner, team FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup;
Relevant excerpts:
- Tour du Haut Var — Winner: Davide Rebellin (ITA), Team: Gerolsteiner
- Tour du Finistère — Winner: David Lelay (FRA), Team: Bretagne - Armor Lux
- Trophée des Grimpeurs — Winner: David Lelay (FRA), Team: Bretagne - Armor Lux

3) Series leader by event (to verify whether David Lelay was series leader at any point and specifically at Tour du Haut Var)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, event, winner, "series leader"
FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup
ORDER BY date;
Relevant excerpts:
- Tour du Haut Var (Feb 24): Series Leader — Rinaldo Nocentini (ITA)
- Trophée des Grimpeurs (May 4): Series Leader — David Lelay (FRA)
- Grand Prix de Plumelec - Morbihan (May 31): Series Leader — David Lelay (FRA)

Assessment:
- For the Tour du Haut Var (the event in question), the winner was Davide Rebellin (ITA), not David Lelay.
- The series leader at that time was Rinaldo Nocentini (ITA), not David Lelay.
- While David Lelay (FRA) appears as series leader later in the series and won other Coupe de France events in 2008 (Tour du Finistère and Trophée des Grimpeurs), he was neither the winner nor the series leader for Tour du Haut Var per the 2008 data.

Conclusion: The claim that series leader David Lelay (FRA) was also the winner of the Tour du Haut Var is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset: the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup. If the claim intended a different year or series, it is outside the scope of the present authoritative data.
