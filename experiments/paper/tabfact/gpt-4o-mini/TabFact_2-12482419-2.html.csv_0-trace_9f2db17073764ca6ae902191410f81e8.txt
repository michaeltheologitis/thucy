Claim interpreted: The average win percentage for seasons with GB (games back) equal to 5 is 535.

Data source
- Database: TabFact (Table-based Fact Verification)
- Table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
- Relevant columns: year (text), record (text), win % (bigint), gb (text)

Evidence and SQL
1) Identify how many seasons have gb = '5'
- SQL: SELECT gb, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons GROUP BY gb;
- Key result: gb = '5' appears exactly 1 time (there are other GB values as well, but only one row with '5').

2) Retrieve the season(s) with gb = '5'
- SQL: SELECT year, record, "win %" FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';
- Result: year = 2010, record = 77 - 67, win % = 535.

3) Compute the average win % for gb = '5'
- SQL: SELECT AVG("win %") AS average_win_percentage FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';
- Result: average_win_percentage = 535.

Conclusion
- The computed average win percentage for seasons with GB = 5 is 535. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “GB” refers to the games-back metric in the standings and matches the gb column in the table.
- “Win percentage” corresponds to the "win %" column, which is stored as an integer scaled by 1000 (e.g., 535 ≈ .535).
