Claim being checked:
- "the season 2010 - 11 detail have a title of 47th and the runner - up be waseda"

What I checked:
- In the public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship table, whether the season corresponding to 2010–11 has title = "47th" and runner-up = "Waseda".

Findings:
- The table stores the season as "2010 - 11 details" (note the plural and spacing). For that season, the title is "47th" and the runner-up is "Waseda". This matches the user’s claim apart from the minor wording difference "detail" vs. "details".

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Locate the season entry around 2010 and retrieve title and runner-up
SQL:
SELECT season, title, "runner - up"
FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season LIKE '%2010%'
ORDER BY season;
Result excerpt:
- Season: 2010 - 11 details | Title: 47th | Runner-up: Waseda

2) Retrieve the full row for the exact season value found above
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE season = '2010 - 11 details';
Result:
- Title: 47th
- Season: 2010 - 11 details
- Winner: Teikyo
- Score: 17 - 14
- Runner-Up: Waseda
- Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo
- Attendance: 25458

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data: for the 2010–11 season entry (stored as "2010 - 11 details"), the title is 47th and the runner-up is Waseda.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the All Japan University Rugby Championship data available in the public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship table.
- "season 2010 - 11 detail" is intended to refer to the entry stored as "2010 - 11 details" in the database.
