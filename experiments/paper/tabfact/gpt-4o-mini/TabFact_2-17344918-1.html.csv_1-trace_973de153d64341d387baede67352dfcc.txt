Claim interpreted: In the year that San Pedro were the winners, the second leg score was 3 - 0.

Data sources explored:
- Available database: public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty (single table with columns: year, winner, runners - up, aggregate, 1st leg, 2nd leg).

Evidence 1: Identify the year(s) where the winner is San Pedro and inspect leg scores.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, winner, "2nd leg", aggregate, "1st leg" 
  FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty 
  WHERE LOWER(winner) LIKE LOWER('%San Pedro%');
- Result:
  - Year: 1984; Winner: san pedro; 1st leg: 1 - 3; 2nd leg: 3 - 0; Aggregate: 4 - 3.
- Interpretation: In 1984, San Pedro were champions and the second leg score was 3 - 0.

Evidence 2: Cross-check which years have a 3 - 0 second leg and see who the winner was.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, winner FROM public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty WHERE "2nd leg" = '3 - 0';
- Result:
  - 1978: federación misionera
  - 1984: san pedro
- Interpretation: Confirms that 1984 (a San Pedro title year) had a 3 - 0 second leg.

Conclusion: The database shows that in 1984, San Pedro were the winners and the second leg score was 3 - 0, which directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Copa San Isidro de Curuguaty, the only available dataset.
- The phrase “3 - 0 be the 2nd leg the year san pedro be the winner” is interpreted as: during the year San Pedro won the competition, the second leg ended 3 - 0.
