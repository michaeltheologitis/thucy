Claim interpreted: "Arienai kisu [episode] is broadcast 7 days after the title with the earliest broadcast date."

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: tsuki_no_koibito
- Relevant columns: "episode title", "romanized title", "broadcast date"

Evidence gathered:
1) Identify the earliest broadcast date in the table
- Result: earliest_date = 2010-05-10
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY')) AS earliest_date
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito;

2) Identify the episode(s) with that earliest date to confirm the “title with the earliest broadcast date”
- Result: Episode Title: おまえが欲しい; Romanized Title: omae ga hosii; Normalized Date: 2010-05-10
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "romanized title", to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY') AS normalized_date 
FROM tsuki_no_koibito 
WHERE to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY') = (
    SELECT MIN(to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY')) 
    FROM tsuki_no_koibito
);

3) Get the broadcast date for the episode with romanized title 'arienai kisu'
- Result: arienai_kisu_date = 2010-05-17
- Executed SQL:
SELECT to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY') AS arienai_kisu_date
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE LOWER("romanized title") = 'arienai kisu';

4) Compute the difference in days between 'arienai kisu' and the earliest broadcast date
- Result: diff_days = 7
- Executed SQL:
SELECT
  (SELECT to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY')
   FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
   WHERE LOWER("romanized title") = 'arienai kisu') -
  (SELECT MIN(to_date(replace("broadcast date", ' ,', ','), 'Month DD, YYYY'))
   FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito) AS diff_days;

Conclusion:
- The earliest broadcast date in the dataset is 2010-05-10 (episode: omae ga hosii).
- The episode 'arienai kisu' aired on 2010-05-17.
- The difference is exactly 7 days. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “arienai kisu” refers to the row where "romanized title" = 'arienai kisu'.
- “title with the earliest broadcast date” refers to the episode(s) having the minimum normalized date within the tsuki_no_koibito table.
- Date normalization via to_date(replace(...), 'Month DD, YYYY') accurately represents the intended broadcast dates.
