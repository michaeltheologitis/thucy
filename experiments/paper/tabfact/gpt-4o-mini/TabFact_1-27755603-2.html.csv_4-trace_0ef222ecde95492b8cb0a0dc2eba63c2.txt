Summary
- Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that the team’s record was 2-4 in the game where the high-rebound line was “Austin Daye (16).” The relevant data should be in a table for the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season that includes a “high rebounds” field and a “record” field.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
- Columns (as reported by the schema tool): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

What I attempted
1) Locate the row where high rebounds contains “Austin Daye (16)” and read the corresponding record value.

Intended evidence query (exact SQL)
SELECT
  game,
  date,
  team,
  score,
  "high rebounds",
  record
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE LOWER("high rebounds") LIKE '%austin daye (16)%';

Tool/execution status
- Multiple attempts to execute the above query (via the query tool that returns both results and the exact executed SQL) failed due to a technical limit: “Max turns exceeded.” As a result, I could not retrieve the actual row values and cannot display query outputs.

Assessment
- Because I could not execute the verification query to read the ‘record’ value for the specific row containing “Austin Daye (16)” in ‘high rebounds’, I do not have direct evidence from the data to support or refute the claim.

Conclusion
- I cannot confirm from the data whether the record was 2-4 in that game.

Assumptions made
- The claim targets the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons season table and uses the ‘record’ column as the team’s running win–loss record after that game, and the ‘high rebounds’ column is of the format “Player Name (Rebounds)”.
