Claim interpreted: A crowd of 66,189 attended a New Orleans Saints game in which the team's record was 6-1 (after the game).

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: NFL seasons (2001 St. Louis Rams). Single table: t_2001_st_louis_rams_season with columns week, date, opponent, result, record, tv time, attendance.

Evidence
1) Saints games on the 2001 Rams schedule
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance 
FROM t_2001_st_louis_rams_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New Orleans%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Saint%';
Result summary:
- Week 7 (Oct 28, 2001) vs New Orleans Saints: Result L 34-31, Record 6 - 1, Attendance 66,189
- Week 14 (Dec 17, 2001) vs New Orleans Saints: Result W 34-21, Record 11 - 2, Attendance 70,332

2) Exact attendance 66,189
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance 
FROM t_2001_st_louis_rams_season 
WHERE attendance = 66189;
Result summary:
- Week 7 (Oct 28, 2001) vs New Orleans Saints: Result L 34-31, Record 6 - 1, Attendance 66,189

Assessment of the claim
- “66,189 crowd attend”: Supported (attendance exactly 66,189).
- “the New Orleans Saint game”: Supported (opponent is New Orleans Saints).
- “with a record of 6 - 1”: Supported (team record after the game is 6-1).

Conclusion: The claim precisely matches the Week 7 game in the 2001 St. Louis Rams season dataset.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the Rams–Saints game reflected in the available 2001 St. Louis Rams dataset and interprets “record” as the Rams’ overall record after the game (the table’s definition).
