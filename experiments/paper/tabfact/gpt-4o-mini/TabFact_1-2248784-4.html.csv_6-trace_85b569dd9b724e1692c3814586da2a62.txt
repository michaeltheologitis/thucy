Summary of available data
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL schema public with table public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp containing 2011 GDP (PPP) in billions of USD for Asian and Pacific countries. Columns: rank mideast (bigint), rank asia (bigint), rank world (bigint), country (text), 2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd (double precision).

Evidence
1) Israel appears in the table with 2011 GDP (PPP) = 235.446 billion USD
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows: Israel | Rank Asia 19 | Rank Mideast 4 | Rank World 50 | 2011 GDP (PPP) Billions of USD 235.446

2) Direct lookup for Israel confirms the value
SQL executed:
SELECT "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE country ILIKE 'Israel';
Result: 235.446

3) The figure 36.897 matches Jordan, not Israel
SQL executed:
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" 
FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp 
WHERE "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" BETWEEN 35 AND 40;
Result: Jordan | 36.897

Conclusion
- Within the available authoritative dataset (2011 GDP, PPP, billions USD), Israel’s GDP (PPP) is 235.446 billion USD, not 36.897. The value 36.897 corresponds to Jordan.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “gdp” as 2011 GDP (PPP) in billions of USD because this is the only GDP measure available in the connected data. If the claim intended a different year, unit (e.g., nominal GDP, per capita), or measure, it is outside the scope of the available dataset.
