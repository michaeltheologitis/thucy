Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a single authoritative table: public.bruce_halford
- Schema (from inspection): columns = year (bigint), entrant (text), chassis (text), engine (text), points (bigint)

Verification approach:
- Identify all records where the engine description corresponds to a Climax Straight-4, allowing for spaces/hyphens (e.g., "Climax Straight - 4").
- Extract distinct chassis from those records and list the underlying rows as evidence.

Evidence 1: Distinct chassis associated with a Climax Straight-4 engine
- Result: Cooper T45; Cooper T51; Lotus 16
- Exact SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT chassis FROM public.bruce_halford WHERE LOWER(engine) LIKE LOWER('%Climax%Straight%4%')

Evidence 2: Row-level records showing engine and chassis pairings
- Rows returned:
  - Year: 1959; Entrant: John Fisher; Chassis: Lotus 16; Engine: Climax Straight - 4
  - Year: 1960; Entrant: Fred Tuck Cars; Chassis: Cooper T45; Engine: Climax Straight - 4
  - Year: 1960; Entrant: Yeoman Credit Racing Team; Chassis: Cooper T51; Engine: Climax Straight - 4
- Exact SQL executed:
SELECT year, entrant, chassis, engine FROM public.bruce_halford WHERE engine ILIKE '%Climax%Straight%4%'

Conclusion:
- The data shows that entries with a Climax Straight-4 engine in this dataset appear with Lotus 16, Cooper T45, and Cooper T51 chassis. This directly supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as: “Climax Straight-4 engines are associated with Lotus 16, Cooper T45, and Cooper T51 chassis in the available dataset.”
- Treated “climax straight - 4” as matching engine strings containing the tokens “Climax”, “Straight”, and “4” in order, allowing for spaces and hyphens.
