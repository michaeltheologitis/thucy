Claim to verify: “the person with the snatch 153.0 and clean & jerk of 180.0 be ijose espinoza ( nca ) with total bodyweight greater than 100 kg.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with one table: public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
- Table columns: name (text), bodyweight (double precision), snatch (text), clean & jerk (text), total (kg) (text)

Evidence collected
1) Check if any athlete has snatch = 153.0 and clean & jerk = 180.0 (numeric comparison)
Result: No rows returned.
Exact SQL executed:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch, "clean & jerk", "total (kg)"
FROM weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
WHERE snatch::double precision = 153.0
AND "clean & jerk"::double precision = 180.0;

2) Identify any “Espinoza” entry and see recorded lifts and bodyweight
Result: One athlete found; recorded as DNF with bodyweight 99.4 kg and no lifts recorded.
Exact SQL executed:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch, "clean & jerk", "total (kg)" 
FROM weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Espinoza%';
Returned row:
- name: josé espinoza ( nca )
- bodyweight: 99.4
- snatch: -
- clean & jerk: -
- total (kg): dnf

3) Confirm NCA athlete entry
Result: Same single record as above.
Exact SQL executed:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch, "clean & jerk", "total (kg)" FROM weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%( nca )%';
Returned row:
- name: josé espinoza ( nca )
- bodyweight: 99.4
- snatch: -
- clean & jerk: -
- total (kg): dnf

Assessment
- No athlete in this dataset has the combination snatch = 153.0 and clean & jerk = 180.0.
- The only “josé espinoza ( nca )” entry has bodyweight 99.4 kg (which is not greater than 100 kg) and no valid lifts recorded (DNF).
- Therefore, the claim that the athlete with 153.0/180.0 is “ijose/josé espinoza ( nca )” and that his bodyweight is greater than 100 kg is not supported by the data; it is contradicted.

Assumptions and scope
- The verification is strictly within the available dataset: weightlifting at the 2007 Pan American Games. NCA is interpreted as Nicaragua.
- Name matching is case-insensitive and based on the name field as stored in the dataset.
