Claim assessed: "the surface be grass on 2 may 1999"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.leanne_baker
  - Columns: outcome (text), date (text), location (text), surface (text), opponent in final (text), score (text)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Confirm that an entry exists for 1999 and specifically for 2 May 1999.
- SQL executed: SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.leanne_baker;
- Evidence excerpt (distinct dates include): 2 May 1999; 11 July 1999; (and others in other years)

2) Retrieve the record for 2 May 1999 and inspect the surface value.
- SQL executed: SELECT * FROM public.leanne_baker WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%2 may 1999%';
- Result:
  - Date: 2 may 1999
  - Location: Coatzacoalcos, Mexico
  - Opponent in Final: Candice Jairala
  - Outcome: Winner
  - Score: 3 - 6, 6 - 3, 7 - 5
  - Surface: Hard

3) Confirm via exact case-insensitive date match.
- SQL executed: SELECT date, surface FROM public.leanne_baker WHERE date ILIKE '2 may 1999';
- Result: date = 2 may 1999; surface = hard

Conclusion:
- The recorded surface on 2 May 1999 is hard (not grass). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the “surface” field in the only available authoritative dataset (public.leanne_baker) and to the entry dated 2 May 1999 found therein.
