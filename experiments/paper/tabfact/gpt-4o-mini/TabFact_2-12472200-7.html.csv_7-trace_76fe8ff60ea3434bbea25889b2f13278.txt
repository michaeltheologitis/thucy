Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected schema to locate Olga Govortsova’s Grand Slam results for 2007–2011.
- Queried the table to read the recorded Grand Slam win–loss tallies per year.
- Assessed whether any year from 2007–2011 had at least 5 Grand Slam match wins.

Data source discovery
- Available schema: public
- Relevant table: public.olga_govortsova
- Columns: tournament (text), "2007" (text), "2008" (text), "2009" (text), "2010" (text), "2011" (text)

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Retrieve the data by tournament and year
SQL:
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011"
FROM public.olga_govortsova;

Key evidence from the returned data (Grand Slam section):
- Row: win - loss
  - 2007: 2 - 2
  - 2008: 3 - 4
  - 2009: 3 - 4
  - 2010: 1 - 4
  - 2011: 1 - 4

Interpretation
- The “win - loss” row records total Grand Slam match results for each year.
- Grand Slam wins by year:
  - 2007: 2 wins
  - 2008: 3 wins
  - 2009: 3 wins
  - 2010: 1 win
  - 2011: 1 win
- No year from 2007 to 2011 has at least 5 Grand Slam match wins.

Conclusion
- The claim that Olga Govortsova had at least 5 Grand Slam match wins in any given year between 2007 and 2011 is not supported by the data. In none of those years did her Grand Slam wins reach 5.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “grand slam tournament match” as main-draw singles matches at the four majors combined per calendar year (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open), consistent with the table’s “win - loss” totals.
- Interpreted the claim as asking whether there exists any year in 2007–2011 with ≥5 total Grand Slam wins (the stricter interpretation “in each year” would also be false per the same data).
