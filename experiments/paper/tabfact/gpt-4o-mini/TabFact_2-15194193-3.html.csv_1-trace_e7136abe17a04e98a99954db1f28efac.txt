Data source overview
- Discovered database schema: public
- Relevant table: public.alberto_pagani
- Columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)
- Semantics: Each row summarizes Alberto Pagani’s season results for a given year and class, including the number of wins in that class for that year.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total wins by class
SQL executed:
SELECT class, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
FROM public.alberto_pagani
GROUP BY class;
Results:
- 500cc: 4
- 350cc: 0
- 250cc: 0
- 125cc: 0
- 50cc: 0

2) Check for any wins outside 500cc
SQL executed:
SELECT *
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE wins > 0 AND class <> '500cc';
Results:
- No rows returned

Analysis
- Summed wins show 4 total wins in 500cc and 0 in all other classes.
- No records exist with wins > 0 in any non-500cc class.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim that all of Alberto Pagani’s wins were in the 500cc class.

Assumptions
- “Wins” refers to Grand Prix race wins as recorded in the public.alberto_pagani table and that the table comprehensively captures his wins across all classes.
