Claim to verify: "plymouth county have 2 location , rockland and stroughton"

Data sources checked
- Available dataset identified via schema inspection: Public schema table massachusetts_route_139 with columns: county (text), location (text), street names (text), milepost (text), roads intersected (text), notes (text).

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results)
1) SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT location, county FROM massachusetts_route_139;
Results:
- Stoughton | Norfolk
- Hanover   | Plymouth
- Rockland  | Plymouth
- Weymouth  | Norfolk

2) SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT county FROM massachusetts_route_139;
Results:
- Plymouth
- Norfolk

Findings
- Rockland is listed in Plymouth County (supported by Query 1).
- Stoughton (interpreting "stroughton") is listed in Norfolk County, not Plymouth County (Query 1).
- Within this dataset, Plymouth County includes at least Rockland and Hanover, so saying Plymouth County has two locations Rockland and Stoughton is incorrect.

Conclusion
- The claim that Plymouth County has two locations, Rockland and Stoughton, is not supported by the data. Rockland is in Plymouth County, but Stoughton is in Norfolk County. Additionally, at least one other location (Hanover) appears under Plymouth County in this dataset.

Assumptions
- "stroughton" is interpreted as the town of Stoughton, MA.
- County affiliations are taken from the massachusetts_route_139 table as authoritative for the listed locations.
