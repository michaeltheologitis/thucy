Summary
- Claim interpreted: The time recorded for rank 4 is lower (faster) than 6:40.02.

Data source overview
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table my_info_table (columns: rank bigint, rowers text, country text, time text, notes text).

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm time format
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM my_info_table LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows:
- Rank 4 has Time = 6:50.48 (m:ss.hh format), indicating times are stored as text in minutes:seconds.hundredths.

2) Parse and compare rank 4 time to 6:40.02
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank,
       time,
       (split_part(time, ':', 1)::int*60 + 
        split_part(split_part(time, ':', 2), '.', 1)::int + 
        split_part(time, '.', 2)::int/100.0) AS total_seconds,
       ((split_part(time, ':', 1)::int*60 + 
        split_part(split_part(time, ':', 2), '.', 1)::int + 
        split_part(time, '.', 2)::int/100.0) < (6*60 + 40.02)) AS is_faster_than_6_40_02 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE rank = 4;
Results:
- rank: 4
- time: 6:50.48
- total_seconds: 410.48
- is_faster_than_6_40_02: false

Conclusion
- Rank 4 time (6:50.48 = 410.48s) is not lower/faster than 6:40.02 (400.02s). The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Lower than 6:40.02” is interpreted as a faster time (numerically fewer seconds).
