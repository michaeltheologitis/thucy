Claim interpreted: “Only 1 person has been a member of the Socialist Party of Albania.” Given the available data source only covers prime ministers of Albania, I verify the claim in that context: the number of Albanian prime ministers whose recorded political party is the Socialist Party of Albania (or contains the word “Socialist”).

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  Columns: name (text), born - died (text), term start (text), term end (text), political party (text)

Evidence and SQL
1) Exact match on party name
- Result: 0 distinct prime ministers with political party exactly equal to “Socialist Party of Albania.” This likely reflects formatting/label differences (e.g., added abbreviations) rather than absence of such entries.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS distinct_prime_ministers_count, ARRAY_AGG(name) AS prime_ministers_names, ARRAY_AGG("term start" || ' to ' || "term end") AS terms FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" = 'Socialist Party of Albania';

2) Case-insensitive contains match on “Socialist” in the party field
- Result: 8 distinct name entries of prime ministers affiliated with parties containing “Socialist.” Names (as returned): Bashkim Fino; Edi Rama; Fatos Nano (2nd time); Fatos Nano (3rd time); Ilir Meta; Pandeli Majko (1st time); Pandeli Majko (2nd time); Ylli Bufi. This already exceeds “only 1.” Note: some entries represent the same person labeled by different terms, but the count still exceeds one regardless of normalization.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS distinct_prime_ministers_count, ARRAY_AGG(name) AS names, ARRAY_AGG("political party") AS parties 
FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
WHERE "political party" ILIKE '%Socialist%';

Conclusion
- The available data shows multiple Albanian prime ministers affiliated with the Socialist Party of Albania (or a party string containing “Socialist”), contradicting the claim that “only 1 person” has been a member.

Assumptions
- Due to the data environment, I interpret “member of the Socialist Party of Albania” within the scope of prime ministers recorded in the provided table, using the political party field as evidence of affiliation. The exact label in the dataset may vary (e.g., abbreviations), so a case-insensitive contains search was used to capture relevant entries.
