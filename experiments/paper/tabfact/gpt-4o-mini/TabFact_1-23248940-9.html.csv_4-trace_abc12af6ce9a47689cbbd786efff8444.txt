Claim assessed: “the bobcat have a record of 3 win and 7 loss.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database containing one table for the Charlotte Bobcats’ 2009–2010 NBA season: t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season.

Schema details used
- Table: t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Verify the format and sample of available records
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt): records are formatted as “wins - losses” such as 24 - 23, 24 - 24, 24 - 25, … 27 - 29. No entries show “3 - 7”.

2) Direct check for a 3–7 record
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, game, team, score, record FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE record = '3 - 7';
Result: No rows returned.

3) Check for any record with 3 wins (to catch formatting variations after the dash)
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, record 
FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season 
WHERE record LIKE '3 -%';
Result: No rows returned.

4) Scope of available data (to understand coverage)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result: 10 rows (covering games 47–56 of the 2009–10 season as seen in the sample).

Conclusion
- Within the available authoritative dataset (10 games from the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season), there is no instance where the team’s record is 3 wins and 7 losses. The records observed range from 24 - 23 through 27 - 29 for the games included. Therefore, this claim is not supported by the data we have.

Assumptions made
- “bobcat” refers to the Charlotte Bobcats NBA team.
- “record of 3 win and 7 loss” refers to the team’s win-loss record at some point in the season.
- Verification is constrained to the available dataset for the 2009–10 season (games 47–56).
