Claim interpreted: “there be more than one be station.”
Working interpretation used for verification: “be station” refers to a station owned by Bell Media.

Data examined
- Source: Database TabFact, schema public, table media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner)

Evidence from the data
1) Full table snapshot (to understand owners/branding present)
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
Result excerpt shows (among others) two rows with owner = bell media: 99.9 Sun FM; 101.5 EZ Rock.

2) Owners and their station counts
SQL:
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) AS station_count
FROM public.media_in_kelowna
GROUP BY owner
ORDER BY station_count DESC;
Result:
- Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: 3
- Jim Pattison Group: 2
- Bell Media: 2
- Sun Country Cablevision: 1
- Vista Broadcast Group: 1
- Astral Media: 1

3) Direct count of Bell Media–owned stations (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as count FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE LOWER(owner) = LOWER('bell media')
Result: 2

4) Listing the Bell Media rows (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE LOWER(owner) LIKE '%bell media%';
Result:
- Frequency: 99.9 FM | Call Sign: CHSU - FM | Branding: 99.9 Sun FM
- Frequency: 101.5 FM | Call Sign: CILK - FM | Branding: 101.5 EZ Rock

Conclusion
- Under the stated interpretation (“be station” = Bell Media–owned station), there are 2 such stations in the table. This is more than one. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- Assumption: “be station” means a Bell Media–owned station. Alternative plausible interpretations yield different outcomes:
  - If “be” means the substring ‘be’ in branding: 0 matches.
    SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE branding ILIKE '%be%'; Result: 0
  - If it was intended as AM stations (common in this domain): there is exactly 1 AM station and 9 FM stations.
    SQL (AM): SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_am FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE LOWER(frequency) LIKE '%am%'; Result: 1
    SQL (FM): SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_fm FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE LOWER(frequency) LIKE '%fm%'; Result: 9
- Because the user phrasing is ambiguous, I chose the owner-based interpretation that maps “be” to Bell Media and stated that assumption explicitly.
