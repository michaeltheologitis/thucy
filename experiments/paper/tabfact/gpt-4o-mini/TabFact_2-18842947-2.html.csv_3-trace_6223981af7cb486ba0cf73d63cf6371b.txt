Claim to verify: "the most point score by the lion in a single game be 41"

Data source and scope
- Available dataset: A PostgreSQL database with a single table public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season, containing game results for the Detroit Lions’ 1976 NFL season.
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).
- Important: The result field encodes the score as "W 41 - 14" or "L 10 - 3". For wins (W), the first number is the Lions’ points; for losses (L), the second number is the Lions’ points.

Evidence retrieved
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week;

- Returned rows (excerpted, key line highlighted for max points):
  Week 1: L 10 - 3
  Week 2: W 24 - 10
  Week 3: L 10 - 9
  Week 4: L 24 - 14
  Week 5: W 30 - 10
  Week 6: L 20 - 7
  Week 7: W 41 - 14  <-- Lions scored 41
  Week 8: W 27 - 6
  Week 9: L 31 - 23
  Week 10: L 17 - 16
  Week 11: W 14 - 10
  Week 12: W 27 - 14
  Week 13: L 24 - 10
  Week 14: L 20 - 17

Analysis
- Parsing the result strings per the win/loss indicator yields the Lions’ points by game as:
  3, 24, 9, 14, 30, 7, 41, 27, 23, 16, 14, 27, 10, 17
- The maximum among these is 41 points, achieved in Week 7 (October 24, 1976) vs. Seattle Seahawks (Result: W 41 - 14).

Conclusion
- Within the scope of the available dataset (Detroit Lions 1976 season), the most points scored by the Lions in a single game is 41. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "lion" as the Detroit Lions NFL team.
- Interpreted the claim’s scope to be the 1976 season because that is the only season available in the connected data.
