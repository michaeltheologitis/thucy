Claim to verify: “14 viral family have a replication site in the nucleus.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered available data sources: PostgreSQL database with table public.viral_disease.
- Schema inspection confirms relevant fields exist for this verification.
  - Table: viral_disease
    - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Method:
- Identify distinct viral families whose replication site includes the nucleus.
- Criteria: replication site contains the substring “nucleus” or “nuclear” (case-insensitive). This counts families that replicate in the nucleus exclusively or partially (e.g., nuclear and cytoplasmic).
- Count distinct families and list them for transparency.

Evidence and results:
1) List distinct families with nuclear replication (case-insensitive match on “nucleus” or “nuclear”)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT family FROM viral_disease WHERE LOWER("replication site") LIKE '%nucleus%' OR LOWER("replication site") LIKE '%nuclear%';

Resulting families:
- Adenoviridae
- Hepadnaviridae
- Herpesviridae
- Orthomyxoviridae
- Papillomaviridae
- Parvoviridae
- Polyomaviridae
- Retroviridae
- Unassigned

2) Count distinct families with nuclear replication (same criteria)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) FROM viral_disease WHERE LOWER("replication site") LIKE '%nucleus%' OR LOWER("replication site") LIKE '%nuclear%';

Result: 9 distinct family entries.

Interpretation:
- The dataset yields 9 distinct family entries matching the nuclear replication criterion. One entry is labeled “Unassigned,” which is not a formal viral family. If we restrict to named families only, the count is 8.

Conclusion:
- The claim that 14 viral families have a replication site in the nucleus is not supported by the available data. The data supports 9 (including an “Unassigned” category) or 8 (excluding “Unassigned”) distinct families with nuclear replication, which is substantially below 14.

Assumptions and notes:
- “Have a replication site in the nucleus” was interpreted as any replication site text containing “nucleus” or “nuclear,” including mixed sites (e.g., nuclear and cytoplasmic).
- Counting was at the family level using the family column in viral_disease. The presence of “Unassigned” indicates at least one record not mapped to a formal family; this was included in the primary count for completeness and noted separately.
- Results are based solely on the available TabFact.public.viral_disease table considered authoritative in this environment.
