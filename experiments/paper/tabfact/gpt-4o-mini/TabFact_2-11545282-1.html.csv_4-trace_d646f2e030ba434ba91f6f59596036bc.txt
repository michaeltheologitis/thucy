Claim interpreted: Among Utah Jazz players (from the available all-time roster data that lists players whose last names start with “A”), after 1985 the United States contributed 4 players, with Louis Amundson being the most recent.

Data discovery and schema
- Data source: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (PostgreSQL).
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve the record for Louis Amundson
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Amundson%';
Result:
- Player: Louis Amundson | Nationality: United States | Position: Forward | Years for Jazz: 2007 | School: UNLV
This confirms Amundson is a United States player and the Jazz year listed is 2007.

2) Retrieve the full available roster slice to identify U.S. players and their start years
SQL executed:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz" AS years, position, "school / club team" AS school
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
ORDER BY nationality, CAST(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '\d{4}') AS INTEGER) ASC, player ASC;
Result (relevant rows shown):
- Rick Adelman | United States | 1974 - 75 | Guard | Loyola (CA)
- J J Anderson | United States | 1982 - 85 | Forward | Bradley
- Isaac Austin | United States | 1991 - 93 | Center | Arizona State
- Shandon Anderson | United States | 1996 - 99 | Guard / Forward | Georgia
- Anthony Avent | United States | 1998 - 99 | Forward | Seton Hall
- Louis Amundson | United States | 2007 | Forward | UNLV
(Other non-U.S. entries in this slice: Rafael Araújo [Brazil, 2006-07], John Amaechi [England, 2001-03], Carlos Arroyo [Puerto Rico, 2002-05].)

From this query, counting United States players whose first Jazz year is after 1985 (interpreting the first 4-digit year in “years for jazz” as the start year):
- Isaac Austin (start year 1991)
- Shandon Anderson (start year 1996)
- Anthony Avent (start year 1998)
- Louis Amundson (start year 2007)
Count = 4. Among these, the most recent start year is 2007 for Louis Amundson.

3) Cross-check: most recent start year per nationality (corroboration)
SQL executed:
SELECT nationality,
       MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '\\d{4}') AS INTEGER)) AS most_recent_start
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
GROUP BY nationality
ORDER BY most_recent_start DESC NULLS LAST;
Result excerpt:
- United States: 2007
- Brazil: 2006
- Puerto Rico: 2002
- England: 2001
This corroborates that for the United States entries in this dataset slice, the most recent start year is 2007 (Louis Amundson).

Conclusion
- The data supports that, within the available Utah Jazz roster entries (last names starting with “A”), after 1985 the United States contributed four players: Isaac Austin, Shandon Anderson, Anthony Avent, and Louis Amundson. Louis Amundson (2007) is the most recent among them. The claim is supported by the executed SQL and the returned rows.

Assumptions
- “United state” is interpreted as “United States.”
- “After 1985” refers to players whose first listed year with the Jazz is strictly greater than 1985 (using the first four-digit year in the “years for jazz” field as the start year).
- The available dataset appears to be a subset of the Jazz all-time roster containing only players with last names beginning with “A”; the claim is verified within this dataset context.
