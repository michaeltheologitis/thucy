Summary
- Data source discovered: Database TabFact, schema public, table t_1954_vfl_season with columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text). Scores are text with total points in parentheses (e.g., 15.4 (94)).

Evidence 1: Match(es) with the highest away team score
- Result: Melbourne recorded the highest away team total points: 15.4 (94) vs Richmond 10.18 (78) on 14 August 1954 at Punt Road Oval.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_away_points, "home team", "home team score", "date", "venue"
FROM t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) = (
    SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER))
    FROM t_1954_vfl_season
)

Evidence 2: Top away scores (to show Fitzroy’s best)
- Top entries by total away points show Melbourne (94) and others; Fitzroy’s highest away total points appearing in the top list is 9.15 (69) vs St Kilda on 14 August 1954 at Junction Oval.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", "away team score", CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_away_points, "home team", "home team score", "date", "venue"
FROM t_1954_vfl_season
ORDER BY total_away_points DESC
LIMIT 10;

Conclusion
- The data shows the highest away team score in the 1954 VFL season was by Melbourne (94 points), not Fitzroy. Therefore, the claim that Fitzroy is the team with the highest away team score is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (1954 VFL season only) and treated the integer in parentheses in the score string as the team’s total points.
