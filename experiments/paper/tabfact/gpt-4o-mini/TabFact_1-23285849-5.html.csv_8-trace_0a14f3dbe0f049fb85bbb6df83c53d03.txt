Claim to verify: "denver lose more than 1 game in a row on 2 occasion during november"

What I checked
- I inspected the available database and found a Denver Nuggets season game log table. I extracted all visible November game results and examined whether there were any losing streaks longer than one game, and whether that happened twice in November.

Data source discovery and structure
- Tables in public schema
  - Evidence SQL executed:
    SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  - Result: t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season

- Columns of t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
  - Evidence SQL executed:
    SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season';
  - Result (abridged): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

November game results (from the season log)
- Evidence SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season ORDER BY game ASC LIMIT 30;
- Relevant rows for November returned by this query (ordered by game):
  - Nov 1: W vs Grizzlies
  - Nov 3: W vs Pacers
  - Nov 4: W vs Nets
  - Nov 7: L at Hawks
  - Nov 10: W at Bulls
  - Nov 11: L at Bucks
  - Nov 13: W vs Lakers
  - Nov 17: W vs Raptors
  - Nov 20: L at Clippers
  - Nov 21: W vs Bulls
  - Nov 24: W vs Nets
  - Nov 25: W at Timberwolves
  - Nov 27: W vs Knicks

Analysis
- The November losses appear on Nov 7, Nov 11, and Nov 20, each separated by at least one win. There are no instances of consecutive losses (>1 in a row) in the November games shown.
- Therefore, the number of occasions in November with a losing streak longer than one game is 0, not 2.

Conclusion
- The claim that Denver lost more than 1 game in a row on 2 occasions during November is not supported by the data. The available game log shows no losing streaks longer than one game in November.

Assumptions
- "Denver" refers to the Denver Nuggets (NBA), and the table t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season is their 2009–10 season game log.
- The November games are fully captured within the first 30 games when ordered by game number (as returned by the query). The listed November entries cover games dated Nov 1 through Nov 27; no consecutive losses are present among these.
