Claim to verify: “the boston celtic only lose 3 game in the 1984 - 85 season”

Summary conclusion: The available game-by-game data for the 1984–85 Boston Celtics shows they had at least 9 losses by January 30 (Game 46), which already exceeds 3 losses. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Data discovery and schema exploration
- Discovered an available database with a table for the 1984–85 Boston Celtics season: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season.

Evidence from the data
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm structure
SQL executed:
```
SELECT * FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season LIMIT 5;
```
Result (abridged to show columns and format):
- Columns: Date, Game, Location, Opponent, Score, Record (where Record is cumulative ‘W - L’ after each game)
- Example rows include records like “27 - 6”, confirming losses are tracked cumulatively.

2) Identify the highest Game number present and its cumulative record
SQL executed:
```
SELECT *
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE Game = (SELECT MAX(Game) FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season);
```
Result:
- Date: Wed Jan 30
- Game: 46
- Location: The Spectrum
- Opponent: Philadelphia 76ers
- Score: 104 - 122
- Record: 37 - 9
Interpretation: By Game 46, the Celtics had 9 losses.

3) Compute the maximum number of losses recorded in the table (from the cumulative Record)
SQL executed:
```
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(Record FROM ' - ([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER)) AS max_losses
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
```
Result: 9

SQL executed to list the rows where this maximum occurs:
```
SELECT *
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(Record FROM ' - ([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) = 9;
```
Result: The same Jan 30 (Game 46) row with Record = 37 - 9.

Assessment
- The claim states the Celtics only lost 3 games in the 1984–85 season.
- The dataset shows that by mid-season (Game 46), the Celtics had already accumulated 9 losses, which is greater than 3.
- Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “lose 3 game” as referring to the number of losses in the 1984–85 NBA season (regular season). The available table appears to cover a portion of the season up to Game 46; even within this partial scope, the Celtics had 9 losses, which is sufficient to refute the claim.
