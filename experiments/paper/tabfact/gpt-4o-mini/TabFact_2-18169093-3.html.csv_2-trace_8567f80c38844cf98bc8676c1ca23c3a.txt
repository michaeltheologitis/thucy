Claim to verify: "england and the united state have the same number of player in the 1981 open championship with 5 each"

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a table t_1981_open_championship (public schema) containing player-level data for the 1981 Open Championship, including a country field.
- Table columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (bigint), to par (text).

Evidence and analysis
1) Count players by country
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY country;

Result summary returned by the tool:
- Scotland: 1 player
- Japan: 1 player
- United States: 5 players
- New Zealand: 1 player
- Argentina: 1 player
- England: 5 players
- Australia: 2 players

2) Validate counts using distinct players
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS total_entries, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_players
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship
GROUP BY country;

Result summary returned by the tool:
- Argentina: total_entries=1, distinct_players=1
- Australia: total_entries=2, distinct_players=2
- England: total_entries=5, distinct_players=5
- Japan: total_entries=1, distinct_players=1
- New Zealand: total_entries=1, distinct_players=1
- Scotland: total_entries=1, distinct_players=1
- United States: total_entries=5, distinct_players=5

Conclusion
- The database shows England has 5 players and the United States has 5 players in the 1981 Open Championship. The claim is supported by two independent aggregations (row counts and distinct player counts) and matches exactly.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "united state" as "United States."
- Interpreted "number of player" as the count of distinct players recorded in the authoritative 1981 Open Championship table provided.
