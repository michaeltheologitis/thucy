Claim being checked: "the jazz have at least 3 guard that be on the team during 1979 - 80 , 1 be james donaldson"

What the data shows
- Number of Jazz guards in 1979–80: 3
- Names of those guards: Brad Davis, Paul Dawkins, Greg Deane
- James Donaldson’s Jazz tenure and position: Center; years 1993, 1994–95 (not 1979–80)

Supporting evidence with executed SQL
1) Counting guards on the Jazz with the 1979–80 season listed and listing their names
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS guard_count, ARRAY_AGG(player) AS guard_names 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE "years for jazz" ILIKE '%1979%80%' 
AND position ILIKE '%G%';
Result:
- guard_count: 3
- guard_names: {"Brad Davis","Paul Dawkins","Greg Deane"}

2) Retrieving James Donaldson’s roster entry
SQL executed:
SELECT * 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE player ILIKE '%James Donaldson%';
Result:
- player: James Donaldson
- position: Center
- years for jazz: 1993, 1994 - 95
- nationality: United States
- school / club team: Washington State

Assessment of the claim
- True: The Jazz had at least three guards on the team during the 1979–80 season.
- False: One of those guards being James Donaldson. The data shows James Donaldson is a Center and his Jazz seasons were 1993 and 1994–95, not 1979–80.

Conclusion: The inclusion of James Donaldson as a 1979–80 guard is incorrect, even though the team did have at least three guards that year.

Assumptions made
- "the jazz" refers to the Utah Jazz franchise for the 1979–80 NBA season.
- Players are considered guards if their position field contains the character 'G' (e.g., G, G-F, F-G).
- Pattern matching for "1979–80" accounted for potential formatting differences in the dash by using a broad ILIKE '%1979%80%' filter.
