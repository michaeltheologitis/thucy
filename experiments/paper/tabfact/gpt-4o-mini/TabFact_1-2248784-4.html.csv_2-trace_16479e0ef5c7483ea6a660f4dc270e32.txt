Summary of verification
- Data source discovery identified a PostgreSQL database with a table named public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp containing 2011 GDP (PPP) values in billions of USD for Asian and Pacific countries.
- Schema inspection shows a column named "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision), confirming the unit as billions of USD for the year 2011.

Evidence from data
- Retrieved Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) value from the table.

Executed SQL
SELECT "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE country = 'Israel';

Query result (from tool): 235.446 billion USD

Assessment
- The claim states: “israel have a gdp (ppp) (billions usd) of 235446 in 2011.”
- The authoritative data shows Israel’s 2011 GDP (PPP) is 235.446 billion USD.
- The claimed figure (235446) if interpreted as billions of USD implies 235,446 billion USD (i.e., 235.446 trillion USD), which is incorrect by a factor of 1,000.
- Note: The numeric value 235,446 would be correct if the unit were millions of USD, but the claim explicitly says “(billions usd).”

Conclusion
- The claim is incorrect as stated because it misstates the unit by a factor of 1,000. The correct 2011 GDP (PPP) for Israel is 235.446 billion USD.

Assumptions
- Country name matched exactly as 'Israel' in the dataset.
- The dataset’s unit labeling (billions of USD for 2011) is taken as authoritative.
