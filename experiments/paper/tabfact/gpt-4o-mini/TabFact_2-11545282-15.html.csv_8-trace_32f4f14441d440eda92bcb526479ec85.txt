Claim to verify: “the Jazz have a Houston graduate from Turkey play for them from 2005–06.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: A PostgreSQL database with a single table, utah_jazz_all_time_roster, containing player, nationality, position, years for jazz, and school / club team.
- Schema (from tool):
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text).

Evidence collected
1) Identify any Turkish nationals who played for the Utah Jazz (and their school/club team)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE nationality ILIKE '%Turkey%' OR nationality ILIKE '%Turkish%';
- Result:
  - Player: Mehmet Okur; Nationality: Turkey; Years for Jazz: 2004 - 11; School/Club Team: Efes Pilsen (Turkey)
- Interpretation: The only Turkish player in the dataset is Mehmet Okur. His listed background is a Turkish club (Efes Pilsen), not University of Houston.

2) Identify Utah Jazz players whose school/club team indicates “Houston” (i.e., University of Houston)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result:
  - Player: Andre Owens; Nationality: United States; Years for Jazz: 2005 - 06; School/Club Team: Houston
- Interpretation: Andre Owens is a University of Houston alumnus who played for the Jazz in 2005–06, but he is American, not Turkish.

3) Check for any player who is both Turkish and a Houston (University of Houston) alumnus
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team"
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE (nationality ILIKE '%Turkey%' OR nationality ILIKE '%Turkish%')
    AND "school / club team" ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: There is no Utah Jazz player who is both from Turkey and a University of Houston alumnus.

Conclusion
- The only Turkish player covering the 2005–06 timeframe is Mehmet Okur, who is not a University of Houston graduate (listed with Efes Pilsen, Turkey).
- The only University of Houston alumnus listed for 2005–06 is Andre Owens, who is not from Turkey.
- Therefore, there was no “Houston graduate from Turkey” who played for the Utah Jazz in 2005–06.

Assumptions
- “Houston graduate” refers to a University of Houston alumnus as indicated in the school / club team column.
- “2005–06” refers to the 2005–06 NBA season; “2004 - 11” for Okur indicates he was with the Jazz through that period, including 2005–06.
