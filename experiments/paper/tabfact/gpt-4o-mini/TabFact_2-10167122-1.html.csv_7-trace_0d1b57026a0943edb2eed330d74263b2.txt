Claim interpreted: In the PGA Championship, Brian Watt(s) has 3 fewer cuts made than in the US Open.

Data source and schema explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: brian_watts
  - Columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), "top - 5" (bigint), "top - 25" (bigint), events (bigint), "cuts made" (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Query (table contents):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.brian_watts;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Tournament: US Open, Cuts Made: 1
- Tournament: PGA Championship, Cuts Made: 4

2) Query (explicit columns):
SQL:
SELECT "cuts made", tournament FROM public.brian_watts;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Tournament: US Open, Cuts Made: 1
- Tournament: PGA Championship, Cuts Made: 4

Analysis based on data:
- US Open cuts made = 1
- PGA Championship cuts made = 4
- Difference (PGA minus US Open) = 4 - 1 = +3, meaning he made 3 more cuts in the PGA Championship than in the US Open.

Conclusion: The claim states that in the PGA Championship he has 3 fewer cuts made than in the US Open. The data shows the opposite: he has 3 more cuts made in the PGA Championship.

Assumptions:
- “Brian Watt” refers to professional golfer Brian Watts, matching the table name and context.
- “Cuts made” is the cumulative count per major as represented in public.brian_watts.
- “US Open” corresponds to the tournament label “US Open” in the dataset (without punctuation).
