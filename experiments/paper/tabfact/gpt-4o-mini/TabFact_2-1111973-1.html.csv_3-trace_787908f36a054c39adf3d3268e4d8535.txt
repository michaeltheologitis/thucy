Summary of the claim interpreted for verification:
- The VCLC weighs 32 t (35.3 tons) and this is the same for the VCRT.
- The VCLC is associated with 160 mm (6.3 in) or 350 mm (13.8 in) rockets, while the VCRT is associated with a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table: tam_tank.
- Schema details retrieved:
  - Table tam_tank with columns: vctp (text), "vca 155" (text), vctm (text), vcpc (text), vclc (text), vcrt (text). No primary keys or relationships reported.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Query to inspect VCLC and VCRT columns
SQL:
SELECT vclc, vcrt FROM tam_tank;

Returned rows (excerpt of the relevant ones):
- Row: vclc = "32t (35.3tons)" | vcrt = "32t (35.3tons)"
  • Interpretation: Both VCLC and VCRT have weight listed as 32 t (35.3 tons).
- Row: vclc = "160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets" | vcrt = "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
  • Interpretation: VCLC entry specifies rocket calibers of 160 mm or 350 mm; VCRT entry specifies a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun.

Assessment against the claim
- Weight: The table shows VCLC and VCRT both at 32 t (35.3 tons). Supported.
- Armament association: The table shows the VCLC paired with 160 mm or 350 mm rockets and the VCRT paired with a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. Supported.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the retrieved data.

Assumptions made
- The statement "have the same vcrt" is interpreted as: the VCLC and VCRT share the same weight value (32 t), based on how the tam_tank table encodes specifications by row (attributes) and variant by column. The second part is interpreted as associating VCLC with rocket calibers and VCRT with the FN MAG 60-20 machine gun for armament entries.
