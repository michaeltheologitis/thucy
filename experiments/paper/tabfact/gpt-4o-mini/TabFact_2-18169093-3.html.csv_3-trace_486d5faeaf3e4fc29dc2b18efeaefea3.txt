Claim: "in the 1981 open championship the win score be 72 , with 2 player tie for this score"

Finding: The leading (winning) score in the available 1981 Open Championship dataset is 70, not 72, and exactly two players tied at that score. There are 8 players at 72.

Evidence from the data
1) Determine the minimum (leading) score
- SQL: SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: min_score = 70

2) List players who achieved the minimum score and count them
- SQL: SELECT player, score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 70;
- Result: Vicente Fernández — 70; Nick Job — 70
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 70;
- Result: player_count = 2
- SQL: SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 70;
- Result: place = t1 for both; to par = E for both (even par)

3) Check how many players had a score of 72 and list them
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count, ARRAY_AGG(player) AS player_names FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72;
- Result: player_count = 8; player_names = {Howard Clark, Ben Crenshaw, David Jagger, Mark James, Greg Norman, Arnold Palmer, Bill Rogers, Sam Torrance}

4) Context: leaderboard ordered by score
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY score ASC, player ASC;
- Result (top lines): t1 — Nick Job — 70 — E; t1 — Vicente Fernández — 70 — E; t3 group at 71 (+1); t9 group at 72 (+2), including Bill Rogers.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the leading score as 70 with two players tied (Nick Job and Vicente Fernández). The assertion that the winning score was 72 with two players tied is incorrect on the score value but correct on the number of co-leaders. Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "win score" as the round-leading score reflected in the provided 1981 Open Championship dataset (which lists a leaderboard with places like t1, t3, t9 and per-player single scores with to-par values).
