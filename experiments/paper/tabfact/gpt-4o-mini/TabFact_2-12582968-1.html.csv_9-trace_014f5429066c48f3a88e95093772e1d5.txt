Claim assessed: “lukáš melich never throw for greater than 78 m.”

Summary conclusion: The data show Lukáš Melich has a recorded throw over 78 m. His maximum recorded throw is 79.36 m at the 2013 World Championships (Moscow). Therefore, the claim is false.

Data source exploration:
- Available data sources (discovery): A PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table: luk_melich.
- Table schema (public.luk_melich):
  - year (bigint)
  - competition (text)
  - venue (text)
  - position (text)
  - notes (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Maximum throw distance recorded for Lukáš Melich
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(notes FROM '([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?) m') AS numeric)) AS max_distance
FROM luk_melich
WHERE notes SIMILAR TO '%[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)? m%'
AND competition IS NOT NULL;
Result: 79.36

2) All competitions where throw distance exceeded 78 meters
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, CAST(SUBSTRING(notes FROM '([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?) m') AS numeric) AS distance_m, notes
FROM luk_melich
WHERE notes SIMILAR TO '%[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)? m%'
AND CAST(SUBSTRING(notes FROM '([0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?) m') AS numeric) > 78
ORDER BY distance_m DESC;
Result row:
- Year: 2013; Competition: World Championships; Venue: Moscow, Russia; Distance: 79.36 m; Notes: "79.36 m"

Conclusion:
- The database records at least one throw by Lukáš Melich greater than 78 m (79.36 m). The claim “never throw for greater than 78 m” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Distances are stored within the notes column as text patterns like “79.36 m,” and the regex extraction accurately captures the throw distance.
- The luk_melich table comprehensively represents the athlete’s performance records available in this data source.
