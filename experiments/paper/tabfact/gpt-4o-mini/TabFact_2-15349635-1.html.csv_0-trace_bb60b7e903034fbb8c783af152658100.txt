Claim to verify: “2 of the team hold the first 2 position with an equal number of point.”

Data source check:
- Available database: public schema containing table t_1940_in_brazilian_football with columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text).

Evidence gathered:
1) Top two positions and their points
- Result:
  - Position 1: Flamengo — Points: 13 — Played: 8 — Against: 12 — Difference: 8
  - Position 2: Fluminense — Points: 13 — Played: 8 — Against: 15 — Difference: 10
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, position, points, played, against, difference
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  WHERE position IN (1, 2)
  ORDER BY position;

2) Equality check of points between positions 1 and 2
- Result: Both teams have equal points (13); count_equal = 2 confirms both positions match the position-1 points value.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_equal
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  WHERE position IN (1, 2)
    AND points = (SELECT points FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 1);

Conclusion:
- The top two positions (1st and 2nd) are held by two teams, Flamengo and Fluminense, and they have an equal number of points (13). This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim to refer to the table t_1940_in_brazilian_football as the relevant standings, and “first 2 position” to mean positions 1 and 2 specifically, with “equal number of point” meaning equal points.
