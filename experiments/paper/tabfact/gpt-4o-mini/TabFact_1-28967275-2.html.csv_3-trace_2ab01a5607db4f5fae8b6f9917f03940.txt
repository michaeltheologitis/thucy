Claim: “Episode 40, Series 14 is titled ‘New Order’.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a single table my_info_table in the public schema. (Discovered via data source exploration.)

Schema context
- Table: my_info_table
  - episode (bigint, not null)
  - series (bigint, not null)
  - "episode title" (text, not null)
  - "original air date" (text, not null)
  - "production code" (bigint, not null)

Evidence
1) Retrieve the record for series 14, episode 40
- Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, series, "episode title" FROM my_info_table WHERE series = 14 AND episode = 40;
- Result (summarized): Episode: 40; Series: 14; Episode Title: new order

2) Confirm exact (case-insensitive) title match to "new order"
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE series = 14 
AND episode = 40 
AND LOWER("episode title") = 'new order';
- Result: 1 row matched

Conclusion
- The database shows that the entry with series = 14 and episode = 40 has the episode title "new order". This supports the claim that Episode 40, Series 14 is titled “New Order” (case-insensitive match).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the episode/series fields in the my_info_table of the available database.
- Title matching is considered case-insensitive (the database stores it in lowercase as "new order").
