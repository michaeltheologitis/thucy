Claim: “there be 4 game in the 2005 milwaukee brewer season where 1 team score no point.”

Summary conclusion: In the available 2005 Milwaukee Brewers dataset (27 recorded games), there are 4 games where one team scored 0 runs (a shutout). Three of these were games where the Brewers were shut out; one was a game where the opponent was shut out. Note: The table contains 27 games, not a full 162-game season, so results apply to the available data.

Data source and structure consulted:
- Table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Total rows (to understand dataset coverage)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;
Result: 27

2) Identify all shutout games (robust parsing of score to extract digits on both sides of the hyphen)
SQL:
SELECT 
    date,
    opponent,
    score,
    regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',1),'\D','','g')::int AS brewers_runs,
    regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',2),'\D','','g')::int AS opp_runs
FROM 
    public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE 
    regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',1),'\D','','g')::int = 0 
    OR 
    regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',2),'\D','','g')::int = 0
ORDER BY date;
Returned rows:
- September 17 | Astros    | 0 - 7 | Brewers_runs=0 | Opp_runs=7  → Brewers shut out
- September 22 | Cubs      | 0 - 3 | Brewers_runs=0 | Opp_runs=3  → Brewers shut out
- September 25 | Cardinals | 0 - 2 | Brewers_runs=0 | Opp_runs=2  → Brewers shut out
- September 29 | Reds      | 2 - 0 | Brewers_runs=2 | Opp_runs=0  → Opponent shut out

3) Summary counts of shutouts
SQL (total shutouts):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_shutouts
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',1),'\D','','g')::int = 0 OR regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',2),'\D','','g')::int = 0;
Result: 4

SQL (Brewers shutouts):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS brewers_shutouts
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',1),'\D','','g')::int = 0;
Result: 3

SQL (Opponent shutouts):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS opponent_shutouts
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
WHERE regexp_replace(split_part(score,'-',2),'\D','','g')::int = 0;
Result: 1

Conclusion: The available data shows exactly 4 games with a shutout. However, the table contains 27 games, not the full season; therefore, this verifies the claim within the scope of the available data, but not necessarily for the entire 2005 season.

Assumptions made:
- “Score no point” is interpreted as scoring 0 runs in a game (a shutout in baseball).
- The score field is interpreted as Brewers runs first, opponent runs second (e.g., “2 - 0” means Brewers 2, Opponent 0). This is consistent with the losing pitcher field and examples reviewed.
- The table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season is the authoritative dataset available to us for this verification, though it includes 27 games rather than the full 162-game season.
