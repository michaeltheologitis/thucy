Claim to verify: “arienai kisu have 3.2% less rating than the title with the earliest broadcast date.”

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: tsuki_no_koibito
- Relevant columns: “romanized title” (text), “broadcast date” (text), “ratings” (text)

Evidence from executed queries
1) Retrieve sample rows (includes the relevant entries and their fields)
SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date", "ratings" FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt (as returned):
- omae ga hosii | may 10 , 2010 | 22.4%
- arienai kisu  | may 17 , 2010 | 19.2%
- fukusyū no puropōzu | may 24 , 2010 | 15.6%
- konna ni suki dattanda… | may 31 , 2010 | 15.5%
- suki to ietara iinoni | june 7 , 2010 | 17.4%
- saishūshōjomakuwakare | june 14 , 2010 | 13.4%

From these rows, the earliest broadcast date visible is “may 10 , 2010” for “omae ga hosii”, with a rating of 22.4%. The title “arienai kisu” has a rating of 19.2%.

2) Directly retrieve the rating for “arienai kisu”
SQL:
SELECT "ratings" FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito WHERE "romanized title" = 'arienai kisu';
Result: 19.2%

3) Range of ratings in the table (context)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(CAST(REPLACE(ratings, '%', '') AS FLOAT)) AS min_rating,
       MAX(CAST(REPLACE(ratings, '%', '') AS FLOAT)) AS max_rating
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito;
Result: min_rating = 13.4, max_rating = 22.4

Calculations grounded in the returned data
- Earliest-broadcast title (from the sampled rows): “omae ga hosii” at 22.4%
- “arienai kisu” rating: 19.2%
- Difference in percentage points: 22.4% − 19.2% = 3.2 percentage points
- Relative percent difference (how many percent less, relative to the earliest title’s rating): (22.4 − 19.2) / 22.4 × 100 ≈ 14.29%

Assessment
- If “3.2% less” is intended as 3.2 percentage points lower, the statement matches the data (22.4% vs 19.2% yields a 3.2-point gap).
- If “3.2% less” is intended as a relative percent decrease, the actual decrease is about 14.3%, not 3.2%.

Conclusion
- The data show that “arienai kisu” is 3.2 percentage points lower than the earliest-broadcast title’s rating. The phrasing “3.2% less” is ambiguous; strictly interpreted as a percent decrease it is not correct, but interpreted as percentage points it is correct.

Assumptions
- “arienai kisu” refers to the row with romanized title exactly matching 'arienai kisu'.
- The earliest broadcast date among the provided rows is “may 10 , 2010,” which appears to be the first episode date; the sample query returned all six episodes, and their dates are in chronological order from May 10 to June 14, 2010.
