Claim interpreted: Carmelo Anthony was the Denver Nuggets’ leading scorer in 12 of the 13 games played in November (assumed November 2009 from the 2009–10 season).

Data source discovered
- Database: public schema
- Table: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season (Denver Nuggets 2009–10 season)

Schema check (to confirm presence of a leading-scorer field)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season';
- Result (abridged): includes columns date (text) and "high points" (text)

Evidence: November game-by-game leaders
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, "high points" FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'November%';
- Result rows:
  • November 1 — Carmelo Anthony (42)
  • November 3 — Carmelo Anthony (25)
  • November 4 — Ty Lawson (23)
  • November 7 — Carmelo Anthony (30)
  • November 10 — Carmelo Anthony (20)
  • November 11 — Carmelo Anthony (32)
  • November 13 — Carmelo Anthony (25)
  • November 17 — Carmelo Anthony (32)
  • November 20 — Carmelo Anthony (37)
  • November 21 — Carmelo Anthony (30)
  • November 24 — Carmelo Anthony (27)
  • November 25 — Carmelo Anthony (22)
  • November 27 — Carmelo Anthony (50)

Aggregate verification
1) Total November games
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_november_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'November%';
- Result: 13

2) Games with Carmelo as high points
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_with_carmelo_high_points FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'November%' AND "high points" ILIKE '%Carmelo Anthony%';
- Result: 12

3) Game(s) where Carmelo was not the high points
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE date ILIKE 'November%' AND "high points" NOT ILIKE '%Carmelo Anthony%';
- Result: November 4 (Ty Lawson was team high with 23)

Conclusion
- The data shows Carmelo Anthony was the Nuggets’ leading scorer in 12 of 13 November games, with the lone exception on November 4. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “November” refers to November 2009 (the only November available in the connected Denver Nuggets 2009–10 season dataset).
- “Leading scorer on the Nugget” is interpreted as the team’s single-game leader in points, represented by the "high points" field in the team’s game log.
