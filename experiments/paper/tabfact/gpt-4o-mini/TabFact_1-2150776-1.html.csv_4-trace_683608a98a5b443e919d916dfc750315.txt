Conclusion
- The data shows that on June 16 (1996), Jeff Gordon drove for Hendrick Motorsports in a Chevrolet, not a Ford. Additionally, there are no instances of Hendrick Motorsports entries using Ford in this dataset. Therefore, the claim that Jeff Gordon was “the driver in a Ford for Hendrick Motorsports” on June 16 is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions and scope
- The claim does not specify a year or series. I verified against the available authoritative dataset (Pocono 400). Within this dataset, the only June 16 entry involving Jeff Gordon is 1996, and it is with Hendrick Motorsports using Chevrolet. No Hendrick-Ford entries exist here.
