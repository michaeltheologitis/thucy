Conclusion
- The data show 6 Solheim Cup editions hosted outside the USA between 1990 and 2013 (inclusive), not 7. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the database.

Assumptions
- The period “1990 - 2013” is interpreted inclusively.
- “Outside the US” is determined by venue not containing the substring “USA” in the venue field, which aligns with the country labels present in the data.
