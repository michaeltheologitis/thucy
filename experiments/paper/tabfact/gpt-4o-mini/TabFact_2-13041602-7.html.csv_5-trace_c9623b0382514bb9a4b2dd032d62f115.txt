Claim interpreted: The Chicago Cubs were an opponent four times in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season (as represented by the available data table).

Data sources explored
- Discovered database content: A PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season (2005 Milwaukee Brewers season games data). Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence 1: Distinct opponents and game counts
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games_played
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY games_played DESC;
- Result returned by the tool (summarized):
  - Reds — 7 games
  - Astros — 6 games
  - Padres — 4 games
  - Cubs — 3 games
  - Cardinals — 3 games
  - Diamondbacks — 3 games
  - Pirates — 1 game

Evidence 2: Sample rows confirming games vs Cubs
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season LIMIT 20;
- Relevant rows returned by the tool (subset shown):
  - september 20 | cubs | 5 - 3 | williams (5 - 9) | 30136 | 74 - 76
  - september 21 | cubs | 7 - 6 | van buren (0 - 2) | 30049 | 75 - 76
  - september 22 | cubs | 0 - 3 | helling (2 - 1) | 31137 | 75 - 77

Conclusion
- The available dataset shows the Brewers faced the Cubs 3 times, not 4. Therefore, the claim that the Cubs were the opponent four times is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “the cub” refers to the Chicago Cubs.
- “opponent 4 time” is interpreted as the Brewers having 4 games against the Cubs within the dataset representing the 2005 season.
- All verification is based strictly on the provided table t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season, which is treated as authoritative within this environment.
