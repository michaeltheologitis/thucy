Claim: “Galina Voskoboeva play a total of 3 game on a hard tennis court.”

Findings:
- The database contains a table of Galina Voskoboeva’s match records, including a surface field. Counting matches on hard surfaces (including indoor hard) yields 3 matches.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct surfaces and counts
SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.galina_voskoboeva GROUP BY surface;
Result:
- hard (i): 2
- hard: 1
- clay: 2

2) Count of hard-surface matches (including indoor hard)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_hard_surface_matches FROM public.galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface ILIKE 'hard%';
Result:
- total_hard_surface_matches: 3

3) List of the hard-surface matches (for transparency)
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, opponent, surface, outcome, score FROM public.galina_voskoboeva WHERE surface ILIKE 'hard%';
Result:
- Date: 28 January 2003 | Tournament: Tipton | Opponent: Matea Mezak | Surface: Hard (i) | Outcome: Runner - up | Score: 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6
- Date: 29 June 2003 | Tournament: Mont - de - Marsan | Opponent: Oleksandra Kravets | Surface: Hard (i) | Outcome: Winner | Score: 6 - 4 , 6 - 2
- Date: 8 November 2005 | Tournament: Pittsburgh | Opponent: Lilia Osterloh | Surface: Hard | Outcome: Runner - up | Score: 6 - 7 , 4 - 6

Conclusion:
- The data shows Galina Voskoboeva played 3 matches on hard courts (including indoor hard). This supports the claim when “game” is interpreted as “match.”

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “game” as “match,” since the dataset records matches, not individual games within sets.
- Treated “hard (i)” as indoor hard, counting it as a hard court surface.
