- The data explicitly lists a match on 1998-06-01 in the Netherlands and a match on 1998-06-03 in Romania. This directly supports the claim that “Netherlands and Romania have game on June 1 and June 3, respectively, in 1998.”

Assumptions noted
- “Have game” is interpreted as those countries hosting/playing matches on the given dates, as indicated by venue locations in the dataset, which catalogs 1998 international fixtures involving Paraguay across various venues worldwide.
