Data sources explored

  - Award: Drama Desk Award | Category: Outstanding Costume Design | Nominee: William Ivey Long | Result: Nominated | Year: 2005
  - (Also present: Outstanding Revival of a Musical — Won)

2) Direct check of the 2005 Drama Desk Outstanding Choreography entry

3) Check if William Ivey Long appears in any Choreography category

Conclusion
- The 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography in the available data is credited to Jerry Mitchell (Won). William Ivey Long appears in 2005 for Outstanding Costume Design (Nominated), not for Choreography. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography did not go to William Ivey Long is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The database focuses on awards data relevant to La Cage aux Folles. The conclusion is based on these authoritative records, which include a 2005 Drama Desk Outstanding Choreography winner entry (Jerry Mitchell) and a separate 2005 Drama Desk costume design nomination for William Ivey Long.
