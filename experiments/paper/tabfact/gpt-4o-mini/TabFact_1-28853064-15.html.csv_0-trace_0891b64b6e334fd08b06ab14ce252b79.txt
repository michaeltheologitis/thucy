Claim to verify: “sergio luis henao be give the general classification award and the point classification award.”

Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia (2010 Vuelta a Colombia results). Columns include: stage, winner, general classification, points classification, mountains classification, sprints classification, team classification.

Evidence from the data
1) Identify the final stage of the race
SQL:
SELECT MAX(stage) AS max_stage FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia;
Result: 13

2) Retrieve leaders of general and points classifications at the final stage (stage 13)
SQL:
SELECT "general classification", "points classification"
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia
WHERE stage = 13;
Result: general classification = "sergio luis henao"; points classification = "sergio luis henao"

3) Confirm exact text (case-insensitive) and that both classifications at the final stage are Sergio Luis Henao
SQL:
SELECT stage, "general classification", "points classification",
       (LOWER("general classification") = 'sergio luis henao' AND LOWER("points classification") = 'sergio luis henao') AS both_sergio
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia
WHERE stage = (SELECT MAX(stage) FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia);
Result: stage = 13; general classification = "sergio luis henao"; points classification = "sergio luis henao"; both_sergio = true

4) Cross-check stages where both classifications list Sergio Luis Henao (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT stage, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_colombia
WHERE LOWER("general classification") = 'sergio luis henao' AND LOWER("points classification") = 'sergio luis henao'
GROUP BY stage;
Result: stages 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 all list both classifications as "sergio luis henao" (including the final stage 13)

Conclusion
- In the 2010 Vuelta a Colombia dataset, at the final stage (stage 13), both the general classification and the points classification are credited to "sergio luis henao." This supports the claim that Sergio Luis Henao was awarded the general classification and the points classification.

Assumptions
- The claim’s context is the 2010 Vuelta a Colombia, which is the only available dataset. The dataset records final leaders at the last stage as final award winners. Names in the dataset are lowercased; this does not affect identity.
