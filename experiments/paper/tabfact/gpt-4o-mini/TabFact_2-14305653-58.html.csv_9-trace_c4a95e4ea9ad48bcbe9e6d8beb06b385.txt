- Finding: Supported by the available data. The dataset lists three matches tagged as “1982 wcq,” with an aggregate scoreline of 7 scored and 3 conceded.

Data exploration and evidence
1) Discover available data sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database with table public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results.

2) Inspect table schema
- Finding: Columns are date (text), city (text), opponent (text), results (text), type of game (text). Goals are embedded in the results field. No explicit qualifier flag beyond type of game values.

3) Identify how qualifiers are labeled
- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results;
- Result: balkan cup; friendly; 1982 wcq
- Interpretation: “1982 wcq” denotes 1982 World Cup qualifiers.

4) List all matches marked as 1982 wcq
- SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, results, city, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq' ORDER BY date;
- Result rows:
  • Date: September 10 | Opponent: Luxembourg | Results: 5:0 | City: Luxembourg | Type of Game: 1982 wcq
  • Date: September 27 | Opponent: Denmark    | Results: 2:1 | City: Ljubljana  | Type of Game: 1982 wcq
  • Date: November 15  | Opponent: Italy      | Results: 0:2 | City: Torino, Italy | Type of Game: 1982 wcq

5) Compute aggregate goals for and against
- Assumption for parsing: results stored as 'goals_for:goals_against' from Yugoslavia’s perspective.
- SQL executed:
SELECT SUM((split_part(results, ':', 1))::int) AS total_goals_for,
       SUM((split_part(results, ':', 2))::int) AS total_goals_against,
       COUNT(*) AS number_of_matches
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq';
- Output: total_goals_for = 7, total_goals_against = 3, number_of_matches = 3.
