Summary conclusion
Based on the available data in the table public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country, there exist players whose active years overlap 1950–1965 and whose total goals are at least 160 (including a maximum of 170). Therefore, the claim that “during the year of 1950 through 1965, the goal score be less than 160” is contradicted by the data.

Key evidence from executed queries
1) Check for any overlapping players with goals ≥ 160 (initial attempt)
Result: No rows returned (this attempt relied on a strict split around an en dash only and likely missed hyphen/spacing variations in the years field).
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, goals, years 
FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country 
WHERE 
    (CAST(split_part(years, '–', 1) AS INTEGER) <= 1965 
    AND (split_part(years, '–', 2) IS NULL OR 
         (split_part(years, '–', 2) <> '' AND CAST(split_part(years, '–', 2) AS INTEGER) >= 1950))) 
    AND goals >= 160 
ORDER BY goals DESC;

2) Robust normalization of year range; list top overlapping players and count
Results returned (top examples):
- Ion Oblemenco — Goals: 170, Years: 1964 - 1976
- Mihai Adam — Goals: 160, Years: 1962 - 1976
- Titus Ozon — Goals: 157, Years: 1947 - 1964
Count of overlapping players (per this query): 3
Executed SQL (top players by goals):
SELECT REPLACE(years, '–', '-') AS normalized_years, name, goals 
FROM list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country 
WHERE 
  (SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 1)::int <= 1965) 
  AND (SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 2) IS NULL OR SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 2)::int >= 1950) 
ORDER BY goals DESC
LIMIT 10;

Executed SQL (count of overlapping players):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count 
FROM list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country 
WHERE 
  (SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 1)::int <= 1965) 
  AND (SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 2) IS NULL OR SPLIT_PART(REPLACE(years, '–', '-'), '-', 2)::int >= 1950);

Interpretation
- The more robust normalization query demonstrates that at least one player overlapping 1950–1965 has goals ≥ 160 (specifically 170), directly contradicting the claim that the goal score is less than 160 in that period.
- The earlier query that found no rows was likely affected by the presence of hyphens vs. en dashes and spacing in the years field and therefore missed valid rows.

Final assessment of the claim
Given the presence of at least one overlapping player with 170 goals (and another with exactly 160), the claim that the goal score is less than 160 for 1950–1965 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “goal score” is interpreted as the goals column in the table public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country.
- “during the year of 1950 through 1965” is interpreted to mean players whose active years overlap the inclusive range 1950–1965 (i.e., start_year ≤ 1965 and end_year ≥ 1950, or open-ended end year).
