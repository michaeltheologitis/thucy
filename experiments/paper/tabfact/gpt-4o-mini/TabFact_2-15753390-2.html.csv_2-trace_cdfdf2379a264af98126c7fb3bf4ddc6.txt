Claim: “2 be the fewest point that roger dutton / tony wright receive.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema containing table t_1972_isle_of_man_tt (1972 Isle of Man TT results).
- Table schema (t_1972_isle_of_man_tt): place (bigint), rider (text), country (text), machine (text), speed (text), time (text), points (bigint).

Evidence from data
1) Identify all rows for the pair “Dutton / Wright” and inspect points
Executed SQL:
SELECT rider, points 
FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt 
WHERE rider ILIKE '%Dutton%' AND rider ILIKE '%Wright%'
Result:
- rider: roger dutton / tony wright, points: 3

2) Compute the minimum points for the pair
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(points) AS min_points 
FROM public.t_1972_isle_of_man_tt 
WHERE rider ILIKE '%Dutton%' AND rider ILIKE '%Wright%'
Result:
- min_points: 3

Conclusion
- The fewest (minimum) points recorded for the pair “roger dutton / tony wright” in this dataset is 3, not 2. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the pair as recorded in the 1972 Isle of Man TT results dataset, and “fewest point” means the minimum points assigned to that pair in the available data. The dataset scope is limited to entries present in t_1972_isle_of_man_tt.
