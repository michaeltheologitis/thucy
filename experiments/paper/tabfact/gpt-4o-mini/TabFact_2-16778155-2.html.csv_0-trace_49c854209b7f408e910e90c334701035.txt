Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single PostgreSQL table: public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season, containing Cincinnati Bengals 2000 season game data.
- Confirmed schema includes week and attendance fields.
- Computed the total attendance for week 8 and inspected the detailed row for that week.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season.

Schema details (relevant columns)
- week (bigint, not null)
- date (text, not null)
- opponent (text, not null)
- result (text, not null)
- attendance (bigint, not null)

Evidence 1: Total attendance for week 8
- Result: 61,603
- Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(attendance) AS total_attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE week = 8;

Evidence 2: Detailed row(s) for week 8
- Result: Week 8 | Date: October 22, 2000 | Opponent: Denver Broncos | Result: W 31 - 21 | Attendance: 61,603
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance
FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season
WHERE week = 8;

Conclusion
- The data shows the total (and only) recorded attendance for week 8 is 61,603, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- "Total attendance for week 8" refers to the Cincinnati Bengals 2000 season dataset available in the environment, not league-wide attendance across all teams for that week.
- The sum equals the single game’s attendance since only one row exists for week 8 in this dataset.
