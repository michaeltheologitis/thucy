Claim interpreted: “Marc Roskin directed at least one episode in Season 1 (of the TV series covered by our available dataset: Leverage).”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database, schema public, table public.list_of_leverage_episodes
- Table columns (from schema inspection):
  - series (bigint)
  - season (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - directed by (text)
  - written by (text)
  - original air date (text)
  - us viewers (in millions) (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count of Season 1 episodes directed by Marc Roskin
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE season = 1 AND "directed by" ILIKE '%Marc Roskin%';
Result: episode_count = 0

2) List of all episodes directed by Marc Roskin (to confirm whether he appears at all and in which seasons)
SQL:
SELECT series, season, title, "directed by"
FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Marc Roskin%'
ORDER BY season, series;
Result rows:
- series=47, season=3,  title=The 15 Minutes Job,       directed by=marc roskin
- series=55, season=11, title=The Experimental Job,     directed by=marc roskin
- series=57, season=13, title=The Girls' Night Out Job, directed by=marc roskin
- series=60, season=16, title=The Gold Job,             directed by=marc roskin
(Note: None are in season = 1.)

3) Cross-check: what episodes are labeled as Season 1 in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT series, season, title, "directed by", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE season = 1
LIMIT 50;
Result rows:
- series=45, season=1, title=The Long Way Down Job, directed by=Dean Devlin, original air date=June 26, 2011

Conclusion
- The dataset shows zero Season 1 episodes directed by Marc Roskin. Therefore, the claim that he directed in Season 1 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The query refers to the TV series represented by the available table public.list_of_leverage_episodes (Leverage).
- “direct season 1” is interpreted as “directed at least one Season 1 episode.”
- Director matching used a case-insensitive search on the "directed by" column.
