Conclusion
- The numeric claim that Jonathan Legear scored 4 more goals than Matías Suárez (for R.S.C. Anderlecht in 2008–09) is supported by the data available: Legear total = 7, Suárez total = 3 (difference = 4). The same 4-goal gap also holds for league goals (Legear 5 vs Suárez 1).
- The clause about Suárez being “the next highest rank player in the Belgian First Division A league who play in the Belgian Cup” is not supported by the data we have. Suárez is not the next-highest league scorer behind Legear, and we cannot isolate “played in the Belgian Cup” specifically from the available columns.

Data source overview
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
- Columns (as discovered): player (text), league (bigint), title playoff (bigint), super cup (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial table inspection (sample rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season LIMIT 20;
Key relevant sample rows returned included:
- jonathan legear — league: 5, title playoff: 1, super cup: 0, total: 7
- matías suárez — league: 1, title playoff: 0, super cup: 1, total: 3

2) Ranking by total goals (to confirm totals for both players and the gap)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, total
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
ORDER BY total DESC;
Relevant results excerpt:
- …
- Jonathan Legear — total: 7
- …
- Matías Suárez — total: 3
=> Difference in total goals: 7 − 3 = 4 (matches the claim’s 4-goal gap).

3) Ranking by league goals (to interpret “Belgian First Division A league”)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, league FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season ORDER BY league DESC;
Relevant results excerpt:
- …
- Nicolás Frutos — league: 6
- Jonathan Legear — league: 5
- Thomas Chatelle — league: 4
- Roland Juhász — league: 4
- Stanislav Vlček — league: 4
- …
- Matías Suárez — league: 1
=> Suárez is not the next-highest league scorer behind Legear; several players (Frutos, Chatelle, Juhász, Vlček, etc.) rank above Suárez in league goals.

4) Proxy for “played in Belgian Cup” (limitations noted)
Because the table does not include a Belgian Cup column, we computed a proxy for “other competitions” goals: other_comp_goals = total − league − title playoff − super cup. This can include Belgian Cup and/or European matches but cannot distinguish the Cup specifically.
SQL executed:
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total,
       (total - league - "title playoff" - "super cup") AS other_comp_goals
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
WHERE league > 0 OR "title playoff" > 0 OR "super cup" > 0
ORDER BY league DESC;
Relevant observations:
- Jonathan Legear — other_comp_goals = 1
- Matías Suárez — other_comp_goals = 1
- Guillaume Gillet — other_comp_goals = 1 (and higher league goals than Legear)
This indicates multiple players had goals outside league/title playoff/super cup, but the dataset cannot isolate Belgian Cup participation or goals explicitly. Hence, we cannot verify any “played in the Belgian Cup” filter with certainty.

Assessment of the claim
- Verified portion: Jonathan Legear scored 4 more goals than Matías Suárez in the dataset (total goals 7 vs 3). The 4-goal difference also holds within league goals (5 vs 1).
- Not supported/ambiguous portion: The phrase “the next highest rank player in the Belgian First Division A league who play in the Belgian cup” does not match the league ranking data (several players rank between Legear and Suárez by league goals). Additionally, the table does not provide a distinct Belgian Cup field, so we cannot confirm the Cup-related sub-filter.

Assumptions made
- The table t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season represents Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season player goal totals across competitions, where:
  - league = Belgian First Division A goals;
  - title playoff and super cup are as labeled;
  - total = goals across all competitions that season.
- “Played in the Belgian Cup” cannot be isolated from the available columns; any inference using other_comp_goals is a proxy and includes non-league non-title-playoff non-super-cup goals (which may include Belgian Cup and European matches).
