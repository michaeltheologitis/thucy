Claim being verified: "the sporter target have a s - 1 fire control"

Summary conclusion: Supported by the data. The entry for “sporter target” lists its fire control as “s - 1”.

Evidence from the database:
- Data source: PostgreSQL, schema public, table my_info_table (columns include: "colt model no", name, "fire control", etc.).

Result 1:
- Returned row:
  - name: Sporter Target
  - colt model no: r6551
  - fire control: s - 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "colt model no", "fire control"
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER('%Sporter Target%');

Result 2 (exact case-insensitive match for robustness):
- Returned row:
  - name: sporter target
  - colt model no: r6551
  - fire control: s - 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "colt model no", "fire control" FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(name) = 'sporter target';

Conclusion: Both queries show that the Sporter Target (Colt model r6551) has a fire control marked “s - 1,” which matches the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “Sporter Target” refers to the entry in the name column of my_info_table.
- The phrase “s - 1 fire control” corresponds to the exact text value stored in the "fire control" column.
