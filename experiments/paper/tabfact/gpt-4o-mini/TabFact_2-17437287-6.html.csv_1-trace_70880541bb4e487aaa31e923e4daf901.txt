Claim: “on march 19, 1984, plymouth argyle play derby county.”

Summary conclusion: In the available (authoritative) 1983–84 FA Cup dataset, Plymouth Argyle and Derby County did not play on 19 March 1984. They played on 10 March 1984 and 14 March 1984.

Data source discovery
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
- Result (excerpt relevant to this task): public.t_1983_84_fa_cup

Schema inspection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1983_84_fa_cup' AND table_schema = 'public';
- Columns (all TEXT): "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"

Evidence 1: All Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County fixtures in 1983–84 FA Cup
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE ("home team" = 'plymouth argyle' AND "away team" = 'derby county') OR ("home team" = 'derby county' AND "away team" = 'plymouth argyle');
- Results:
  • plymouth argyle 0 - 0 derby county — 10 March 1984
  • derby county 0 - 1 plymouth argyle — 14 March 1984

Evidence 2: Any FA Cup match on 19 March 1984
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE lower("date") = lower('19 march 1984');
- Result: No rows returned (no FA Cup matches recorded on 19 March 1984 in this dataset).

Assessment
- The dataset shows Plymouth Argyle and Derby County played on 10 March 1984 and again on 14 March 1984 (a replay). There is no record in the 1983–84 FA Cup data of them playing on 19 March 1984.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions and scope
- The verification is grounded in the available authoritative dataset (1983–84 FA Cup). If the claim intended a league or other competition fixture on that date, such data is outside the scope of the accessible sources. Within the FA Cup data, the claim is inaccurate.
