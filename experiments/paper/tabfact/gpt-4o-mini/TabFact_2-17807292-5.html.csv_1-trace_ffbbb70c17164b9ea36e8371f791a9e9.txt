Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2008_pga_championship.
- Schema (from inspection): columns = place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text). No keys defined.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial exact-name lookup (returned no rows; switched to partial match to account for name formatting):
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player IN ('Henrik Stenson', 'Aaron Baddeley', 'Charlie Wi');
Result: 0 rows

2) Case-insensitive partial-name lookup (returned matching rows):
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Stenson%' OR player ILIKE '%Baddeley%' OR player ILIKE '%Wi%';
Results:
- Player: Henrik Stenson, Country: Sweden
- Player: Charlie Wi, Country: South Korea
- Player: Aaron Baddeley, Country: Australia

Verification of each sub-claim
- "Henrik Stenson be from Sweden": Supported by the row listing Henrik Stenson with country = Sweden.
- "Aaron Baddeley be from Australia": Supported by the row listing Aaron Baddeley with country = Australia.
- "Charlie Wi be from South Korea": Supported by the row listing Charlie Wi with country = South Korea.

Assumptions
- The public.t_2008_pga_championship table’s country field reflects each player’s nationality.
- "Charlie Wi" refers to the professional golfer Charlie Wi, which matches the dataset entry.
