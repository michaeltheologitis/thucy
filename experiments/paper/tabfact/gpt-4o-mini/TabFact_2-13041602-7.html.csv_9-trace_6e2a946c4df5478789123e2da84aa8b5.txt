Claim to verify: In the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season, every game was attended by more than 30,000 people.

Summary of findings:
- The available 2005 Milwaukee Brewers game-level attendance data shows many games with attendance at or below 30,000. Therefore, the universal claim (“every game”) is false. Even a single game ≤ 30,000 is enough to refute the claim; the data shows 19 such games in the recorded subset.

Key evidence from data:
1) Attendance distribution for the recorded 2005 Milwaukee Brewers games
- Result:
  - Total games: 27
  - Games with attendance > 30,000: 8
  - Games with attendance ≤ 30,000 or NULL: 19
  - Minimum attendance: 13,173
  - Maximum attendance: 37,756
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN attendance > 30000 THEN 1 END) AS games_above_30000,
         COUNT(CASE WHEN attendance <= 30000 OR attendance IS NULL THEN 1 END) AS games_below_or_equal_30000,
         MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance,
         MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season;

2) Concrete counterexamples (games with attendance ≤ 30,000)
- Partial list of rows returned (date, opponent, attendance):
  - September 6 vs Reds: 13,351
  - September 29 vs Reds: 13,173
  - September 2 vs Padres: 18,231
  - September 11 vs Astros: 17,392
  - September 13 vs Diamondbacks: 23,708
  - September 23 vs Cardinals: 22,472
  - September 27 vs Reds: 28,031
  - September 30 vs Pirates: 20,922
  (19 games total at or below 30,000 in the dataset.)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance
  FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
  WHERE attendance <= 30000 OR attendance IS NULL;

Conclusion:
- The claim is inaccurate. The dataset contains numerous 2005 Milwaukee Brewers games with attendance at or below 30,000, so it is not true that every game exceeded 30,000 attendees.

Assumptions and notes:
- The table public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season is treated as authoritative for 2005 Brewers game-by-game attendance. The available rows appear to cover (at least) September games; regardless of scope, a single counterexample (of which there are many) falsifies the universal claim.
