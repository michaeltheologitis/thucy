Claim interpreted: "The Buffalo Bills played before Week 7 in Tulane Stadium at the Dallas Cowboys."

What the data shows (authoritative dataset available: New York Giants 1970 season):
- Buffalo Bills game on the Giants’ schedule occurred in Week 12 and was played at Yankee Stadium (not before Week 7, not at Tulane Stadium).
- A game at Tulane Stadium occurred in Week 3, but it was against the New Orleans Saints (not the Buffalo Bills, not the Dallas Cowboys).
- Games involving the Dallas Cowboys occurred in Week 2 (at the Cotton Bowl, Dallas) and Week 8 (at Yankee Stadium, New York); neither was at Tulane Stadium.

Direct evidence (query results with executed SQL):
1) Full 1970 New York Giants season table
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season;
- Returned rows include:
  • Week 2 | 1970-09-27 | dallas cowboys | l 28-10 | cotton bowl | 57236
  • Week 3 | 1970-10-04 | new orleans saints | l 14-10 | tulane stadium | 69126
  • Week 12 | 1970-12-06 | buffalo bills | w 20-6 | yankee stadium | 62870
  • Week 8 | 1970-11-08 | dallas cowboys | w 23-20 | yankee stadium | 62938

Assessment against the claim:
- "Buffalo Bills played before Week 7": Not supported here; the Bills appear in Week 12.
- "in Tulane Stadium": Not supported for the Bills; Tulane Stadium game was vs. Saints.
- "at the Dallas Cowboys": Not supported; the Cowboys games were Week 2 (Cotton Bowl) and Week 8 (Yankee Stadium), and have no connection with Tulane Stadium or the Bills in this dataset.

Conclusion: The available data contradicts the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the user’s statement as referring to an NFL regular-season context and checked the only authoritative dataset available (1970 New York Giants season) for occurrences involving Buffalo Bills, Tulane Stadium, and Dallas Cowboys.
- "At the Dallas Cowboys" was interpreted as a game against the Dallas Cowboys at their home venue. If the user intended a different season/team context, it is not available in the current data source, so conclusions are limited to this dataset.
