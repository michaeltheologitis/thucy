What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a database (TabFact) with a table public.media_in_kelowna containing media outlet details for Kelowna, including frequency, call sign, branding, format, and owner.

Evidence from the data
1) Full table inspection
- Result excerpt shows a row: frequency = "1150 am", call sign = "ckfr", branding = "am 1150", format = "news / talk".
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna;

2) Targeted check for frequency 1150 am
- Returned details:
  - Frequency: 1150 am
  - Branding: am 1150
  - Call Sign: ckfr
  - Format: news / talk
- Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE LOWER(frequency) = LOWER('1150 am');

Conclusion
- The data shows that for the Kelowna market entry at 1150 AM (CKFR), the listed branding is "am 1150". This supports the claim that “AM 1150” (case-insensitive) is the branding for the frequency 1150 AM in this dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the question as asking whether the branding for the 1150 AM radio frequency (in the available Kelowna media dataset) is “AM 1150.”
- Treated branding and frequency comparisons as case-insensitive (e.g., “am 1150” vs. “AM 1150”).
