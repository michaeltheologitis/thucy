What I verified
- Claim interpreted: whether there were more than one season finale on May 26, 2010, within the available authoritative dataset.

Data sources discovered
- Connected source: TabFact database, public schema
- Available table: public.csi_franchise
  - Columns: season (bigint), episodes (bigint), "time slot (est)" (text), "season premiere" (text), "season finale" (text), "tv season" (text), rank (bigint), "viewers (in millions)" (double precision)

Method and evidence
1) Count season finales on May 26 (any year)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.csi_franchise WHERE LOWER("season finale") LIKE '%may 26%';
- Result: 1

2) List details for finales on May 26
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "tv season", "season finale" FROM public.csi_franchise WHERE LOWER("season finale") LIKE '%may 26%';
- Result:
  - season: 6, tv season: 2009 - 2010, season finale: May 26, 2010

3) Confirm finales in 2010
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "tv season", "season finale" FROM public.csi_franchise WHERE LOWER("season finale") LIKE '%2010%';
- Result:
  - season: 6, tv season: 2009 - 2010, season finale: May 26, 2010

Conclusion based on data
- The dataset shows exactly one season finale on May 26, 2010 (Season 6 in the 2009–2010 TV season). There are not more than one. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The verification is strictly within the scope of the available authoritative dataset (public.csi_franchise). If the intent was to consider all TV shows broadly, that is outside the scope of the accessible data; conclusions here apply to this dataset only.
