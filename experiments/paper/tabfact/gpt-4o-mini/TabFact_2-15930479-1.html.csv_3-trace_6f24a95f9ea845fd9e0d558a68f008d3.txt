Conclusion: Jérôme Pineau was not the winner of the October 9 event in the available dataset; the winner was Bernhard Eisel. Jérôme Pineau was the series leader at that time.

Evidence from the database:
- Data source: PostgreSQL, schema public, table t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup (columns: date TEXT, event TEXT, winner TEXT, team TEXT, "series leader" TEXT)

1) Full table retrieval (showing the October 9 entry)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, event, winner, team, "series leader" FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup;
Key returned row:
- date: october 9; event: paris - bourges; winner: bernhard eisel ( aut ); team: team columbia; series leader: jérôme pineau ( fra )

2) Direct lookup for the October 9 row (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_french_road_cycling_cup WHERE LOWER(date) = LOWER('october 9') LIMIT 1;
Returned row:
- Date: october 9
- Event: paris - bourges
- Winner: bernhard eisel ( aut )
- Team: team columbia
- Series Leader: jérôme pineau ( fra )

Assessment relative to the claim:
- Claim: “jérôme pineau be the winner for october 9's event.”
- Finding: The winner on October 9 (Paris - Bourges) was Bernhard Eisel. Jérôme Pineau was the series leader, not the winner.

Assumptions made:
- “October 9’s event” refers to the October 9 entry in the 2008 French Road Cycling Cup table available in the connected database.
