Claim interpreted: “Manchester United have been 2nd in the league position since 17 November 2005.” This implies a continuous 2nd-place league standing from 17 Nov 2005 onward.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season (2005–06 season data for Manchester United).
- Relevant schema (from inspection): columns include date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Premier League standings around November 2005
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "result f - a", "league position" 
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season 
WHERE date ILIKE '%November 2005%';

Result returned:
- 6 November 2005 — Opponents: Chelsea — Result: 1 - 0 — League Position: 4th
- 19 November 2005 — Opponents: Charlton Athletic — Result: 3 - 1 — League Position: 3rd
- 27 November 2005 — Opponents: West Ham United — Result: 2 - 1 — League Position: 2nd

Analysis
- The claim asserts Manchester United were 2nd since 17 Nov 2005. The nearest subsequent league fixture date in the dataset is 19 Nov 2005, at which point the league position is recorded as 3rd, not 2nd.
- The data show they only reached 2nd by 27 Nov 2005. Therefore, they were not 2nd continuously starting from 17 Nov 2005.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: on 19 Nov 2005, Manchester United were 3rd, not 2nd; they achieved 2nd by 27 Nov 2005. Thus, they were not 2nd “since 17 November 2005.”

Assumptions made
- “League position” refers to Manchester United’s position in the Premier League table as recorded after each relevant league matchday.
- “Since 17 November 2005” is interpreted as continuously from that date onward.
- Because no match took place precisely on 17 Nov 2005 in the dataset, the nearest subsequent matchday (19 Nov 2005) is used as the reference for verifying the claim.
