Claim interpreted: In November 1997, when the New Orleans Saints were the opponent, that game had the least attendance of the season (within the available 1997 Oakland Raiders season data).

Conclusion: No. The least-attended Raiders game of the 1997 season was Week 1 vs the Tennessee Oilers (30,171). The November 9, 1997 game vs the New Orleans Saints had 40,091 attendees, which is not the season low.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):

1) Identify the game against the New Orleans Saints
- Result: Week 11, November 9, 1997, Opponent: New Orleans Saints, Result: L 13 - 10, TV Time: Fox 1:15 PM, Attendance: 40,091
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "tv time", attendance 
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New Orleans%';

2) Find the least-attended game(s) of the 1997 season
- Result: Week 1, August 31, 1997, Opponent: Tennessee Oilers, Result: L 24 - 21, TV Time: NBC 10:00 AM, Attendance: 30,171 (minimum of the season)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "tv time", attendance
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season);

3) Full season rows (to show context, including the November entries and other low attendances)
- Sample of returned rows (ordered by week) included:
  - Week 10: November 2, 1997 — Carolina Panthers — Attendance: 71,064
  - Week 11: November 9, 1997 — New Orleans Saints — Attendance: 40,091
  - Week 12: November 16, 1997 — San Diego Chargers — Attendance: 65,714
  - Week 13: November 24, 1997 — Denver Broncos — Attendance: 75,307
  - Week 14: November 30, 1997 — Miami Dolphins — Attendance: 50,569
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, attendance 
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season 
ORDER BY week ASC;

Reasoning based on data:
- The Saints game in November had an attendance of 40,091.
- The season’s minimum attendance was 30,171 (Week 1 vs Tennessee Oilers), which is lower than 40,091.
- Therefore, the Saints game was not the least-attended game of the Raiders’ 1997 season.

Assumptions made:
- Because the only accessible dataset covers the 1997 Oakland Raiders season, the claim was interpreted relative to the Raiders’ 1997 schedule and attendances.
- "Least attendance of the season" refers to the least attendance among all Raiders games in the 1997 season.
