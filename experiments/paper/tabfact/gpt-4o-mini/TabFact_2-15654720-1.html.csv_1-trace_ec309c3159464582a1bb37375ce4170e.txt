Summary conclusion: The claim “6 cash have earnings of 39380” is not supported by the available data. In the dataset, the only row with cashes = 6 has earnings = 9500, and the only row with earnings = 39380 has cashes = 10. A direct check for rows where cashes = 6 AND earnings = 39380 returns no results.

Data source discovery
- Discovered database/schema: public
- Tables: my_info_table

Schema overview (from tool)
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - season (text)
  - events (bigint)
  - cashes (bigint)
  - match play (bigint)
  - tv finals (bigint)
  - pba titles (bigint)
  - average (double precision)
  - earnings (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Query: list rows where cashes = 6
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, cashes, earnings, events, average 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE cashes = 6;
Result:
- season: 2002 - 03, cashes: 6, earnings: 9500, events: 7, average: 210.88

2) Query: list rows where earnings = 39380
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE earnings = 39380;
Result:
- season: 2011 - 12, events: 13, cashes: 10, match play: 7, tv finals: 2, pba titles: 1, average: 224.62, earnings: 39380

3) Query: check for any row with both cashes = 6 AND earnings = 39380
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE cashes = 6 AND earnings = 39380;
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion
- The dataset shows no record where cashes = 6 and earnings = 39380. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions due to ambiguity
- Interpreted “6 cash” as the cashes field in public.my_info_table equaling 6.
- Interpreted “earnings of 39380” as the earnings field equaling the integer 39380.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a row-level season record within this table.
