Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. In the html5_video table, the only row where theora = '2.3' and h264 = '3.0' has vp8 (webm) = 'r47759'.

Data source context
- Database: catalog
- Schema: public
- Table: html5_video
- Relevant columns: theora (text), h264 (text), vp8 (webm) (text), plus browser, operating system, latest stable release

Evidence
1) Locate rows where theora = '2.3' and h264 = '3.0' (context on the matching record)
SQL executed:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", theora, h264 
FROM public.html5_video 
WHERE theora = '2.3' AND h264 = '3.0';
Result summary: 1 row found
- Browser: android browser
- Operating System: android
- Latest Stable Release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012)
- Theora: 2.3
- H264: 3.0

2) Verify that, for those rows, vp8 (webm) equals 'r47759'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_vp8 FROM public.html5_video WHERE theora = '2.3' AND h264 = '3.0' AND "vp8 (webm)" = 'r47759';
Result: 1 row

3) Confirm the total number of rows matching theora = '2.3' and h264 = '3.0'
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_no_vp8 FROM public.html5_video WHERE theora = '2.3' AND h264 = '3.0';
Result: 1 row

Interpretation
- There is exactly one record where theora is 2.3 and h264 is 3.0.
- For that record, vp8 (webm) equals 'r47759'.

Assumptions
- The statement refers to values in the public.html5_video table, interpreting “when theora be 2.3 and the h264 be 3.0 , the vp8 ( webm ) be r47759” as a condition on row values within this dataset.
