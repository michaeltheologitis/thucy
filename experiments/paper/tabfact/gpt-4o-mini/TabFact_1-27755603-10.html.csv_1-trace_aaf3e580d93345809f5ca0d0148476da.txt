Claim to verify: “the detroit piston lose 6 game during this period of their 2010 - 2011 season.”

Summary of finding
- In the available dataset for the 2010–11 Detroit Pistons (covering games 62 through 73), the Pistons lost 8 games, not 6. Thus, within this period, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Evidence from the database
1) Period covered and total games in this slice
SQL:
SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game, COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
Result:
- min_game = 62
- max_game = 73
- total_games = 12

2) How wins/losses are encoded in the “score” column (to ensure correct filtering)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT score FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season LIMIT 20;
Sample results show lower-case markers:
- l 96 - 104 (ot)
- l 101 - 131 (ot)
- w 100 - 88 (ot)
- w 113 - 102 (ot)
- l 105 - 116 (ot)
- l 90 - 92 (ot)
- w 99 - 95 (ot)
- l 94 - 104 (ot)
- l 94 - 100 (ot)
- l 104 - 111 (ot)
- l 91 - 97 (ot)
- w 107 - 93 (ot)

3) Count of losses in this period (games 62–73)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE score LIKE 'l%';
Result:
- losses = 8

4) Count of wins in this period (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE score LIKE 'w%';
Result:
- wins = 4

Conclusion
- During the period represented in the available 2010–11 dataset (games 62–73), the Detroit Pistons lost 8 games, not 6. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data for this period.

Assumptions
- “This period” refers to the span of games present in the available table (games 62 through 73 of the 2010–11 season), which corresponds roughly to March 2011, as shown by the data.
- The “team” column represents the opponent (the table is specifically the Detroit Pistons’ season game log).
