Claim: “James Donaldson had 2 stints on the Jazz’s roster, totaling 5 years.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster

Evidence from the data:
1) Locate James Donaldson’s entry
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Donaldson%';
- Result (key fields):
  - player: James Donaldson
  - years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95
  - position: Center
  - school / club team: Washington State

2) Confirm table format and the exact “years for jazz” value
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%James Donaldson%';
- Result:
  - player: James Donaldson
  - years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95

3) Show sample rows to interpret how the “years for jazz” field is formatted (ranges vs. single seasons)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster LIMIT 20;
- Sample results (excerpt):
  - Adrian Dantley — years for jazz: 1979 - 86
  - Brad Davis — years for jazz: 1979 - 80
  - James Donaldson — years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95
  This indicates: ranges like “1979 - 86” denote multiple consecutive seasons; a format like “1994 - 95” denotes a single NBA season; comma-separated values represent separate stints.

Findings:
- Number of stints: The value “1993 , 1994 - 95” contains two comma-separated parts, indicating 2 separate stints with the Utah Jazz.
- Total seasons/years: “1994 - 95” is one NBA season. The single year “1993” is presented as a standalone entry, which (by the table’s conventions) represents a one-season stint. Therefore, the data supports at most 2 seasons with the Jazz, not 5.

Conclusion:
- “2 stints” component: Supported by the data.
- “total 5 years” component: Contradicted by the data; the table supports approximately 2 seasons in total.

Assumptions:
- “Stint” is interpreted as each comma-separated segment of the “years for jazz” field.
- “Years” is interpreted as NBA seasons per the table’s formatting (e.g., “1994 - 95” = the 1994–95 season; a standalone year like “1993” denotes a single-season entry).
