Claim interpreted: Plymouth Argyle played Derby County (with Derby County as the away team) after 14 March 1984.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1983_84_fa_cup (FA Cup 1983–84 matches)
  - Columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Check for any Plymouth Argyle vs Derby County matches (either home/away) after 14 March 1984
Executed SQL:
select * from public."t_1983_84_fa_cup" where (("home team" = 'Plymouth Argyle' and "away team" = 'Derby County') or ("home team" = 'Derby County' and "away team" = 'Plymouth Argyle')) and to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') > date '1984-03-14';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Check specifically for Derby County as the away team after 14 March 1984
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE "away team" = 'Derby County' AND to_date("date", 'DD Month YYYY') > '1984-03-14';
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
Within the FA Cup 1983–84 dataset, there is no record of Plymouth Argyle playing Derby County (with Derby as the away team, or in either home/away configuration) after 14 March 1984. The claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “play the away team Derby County” to mean a match where Plymouth Argyle were the home team and Derby County were the away team; I also checked the reverse fixture to cover ambiguity.
- The verification is constrained to the available dataset (FA Cup 1983–84). League or other competitions are outside this data scope.
