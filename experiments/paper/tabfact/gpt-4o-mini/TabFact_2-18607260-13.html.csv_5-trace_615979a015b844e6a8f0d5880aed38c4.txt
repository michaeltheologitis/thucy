Claim evaluated: “the kirin cup have game on both june 1 and 3 , 1998.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football
  - Columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), comp (text), report (text)
  - Scope note: This table records Paraguayan football matches and competitions in 1998, which may include Kirin Cup fixtures involving Paraguay.

Evidence collected
1) Retrieve all 1998 Kirin Cup entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%Kirin Cup%';
- Result:
  - Date: May 17, 1998 | Venue: Olympic Stadium, Tokyo, Japan | Score: 1 - 1 | Competition: Kirin Cup | Report: 455
  - Date: May 21, 1998 | Venue: Kobe Universiade Memorial Stadium, Kobe, Japan | Score: 1 - 0 | Competition: Kirin Cup | Report: 456
- Interpretation: In this dataset, Kirin Cup matches involving Paraguay in 1998 are recorded on May 17 and May 21, not in June.

2) Check specifically for matches on June 1 or June 3, 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, comp, venue, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date IN ('June 1, 1998', 'June 3, 1998');
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: The dataset contains no Paraguayan match entries (of any competition) on June 1 or June 3, 1998.

3) Check for any June 1998 entries at all
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, comp, venue, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE 'June%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: No Paraguayan match entries are recorded with June 1998 dates in this table.

Conclusion
- Within the available, authoritative dataset, the Kirin Cup entries involving Paraguay in 1998 occurred on May 17 and May 21, and there are no entries on June 1 or June 3, 1998. Therefore, the claim that the Kirin Cup had games on both June 1 and June 3, 1998 is contradicted by the data at hand.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The verification is grounded in the TabFact database’s public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football table. This dataset reliably reflects Paraguayan football activity in 1998, including Kirin Cup fixtures involving Paraguay. It may not list Kirin Cup matches that did not involve Paraguay. The conclusion above is therefore specific to the evidence available in this dataset.
