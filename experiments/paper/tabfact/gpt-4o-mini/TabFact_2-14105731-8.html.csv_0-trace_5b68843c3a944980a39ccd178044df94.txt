Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the schema to ground the interpretation of the claim.
- Queried the dataset for the format associated with season 6 and validated the number of rows for that season.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table public.my_info_table

Schema overview (from schema inspection)
- Table: my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), season (bigint), format (text), title (text), original airdate (text)
  - No defined relationships or constraints noted

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Distinct format(s) for season 6
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT DISTINCT format FROM my_info_table WHERE season = 6;
   - Result: q145

2) Row count for season 6
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT COUNT(*) FROM my_info_table WHERE season = 6;
   - Result: 1

Conclusion
- The data shows that for season 6, the distinct format value is q145. This supports the claim that “the format of season 6 be q145.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the value of the 'format' field for all entries where season = 6 in public.my_info_table.
