Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there exists a game with a score of 3-2 that was held in Chongqing, China.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: public.kwak_tae_hwi.
- Schema (public.kwak_tae_hwi): columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text). No keys/constraints.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Retrieve any games with score equal to 3-2 (allowing common formatting variants) and venue containing both “Chongqing” and “China” (case-insensitive).
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE (score ILIKE '3-2' OR score ILIKE '3 - 2' OR score ILIKE '3–2' OR score ILIKE '3—2') AND venue ILIKE '%Chongqing%' AND venue ILIKE '%China%';
Result:
- Date: February 17, 2008; Venue: Chongqing, China; Score: 3 - 2; Result: 3 - 2; Competition: 2008 East Asian Cup

2) Count the number of such games to check uniqueness of the match.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE (score ILIKE '3-2' OR score ILIKE '3 - 2' OR score ILIKE '3–2' OR score ILIKE '3—2') AND venue ILIKE '%Chongqing%' AND venue ILIKE '%China%';
Result: 1
