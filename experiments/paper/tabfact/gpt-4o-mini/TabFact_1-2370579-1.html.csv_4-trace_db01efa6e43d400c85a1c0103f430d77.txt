Objective: Verify the claim that “on 30 November 1966, the episode ‘The Kill (Part Two)’ originally aired.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: the_baron (episodes of the TV series “The Baron”)
- Relevant columns: episode, prod, title, originalairdate (text)

Step-by-step evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for an exact title match of “The Kill (Part Two)”.
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM the_baron WHERE title = 'The Kill (Part Two)';
Result: No rows returned. The exact title “The Kill (Part Two)” is not present.

2) Search for any titles containing “Kill”.
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, prod, title, originalairdate FROM the_baron WHERE title ILIKE '%Kill%';
Result (relevant rows):
- Episode 7 | Title: the killing (part two) | Original Airdate: 9 November 1966
- Episode 17 | Title: time to kill | Original Airdate: 18 January 1967
Interpretation: The likely intended episode is “The Killing (Part Two),” not “The Kill (Part Two).” Its listed original air date is 9 November 1966.

3) Confirm the exact row for “The Killing (Part Two)”.
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, prod, title, originalairdate 
FROM the_baron 
WHERE title ILIKE '%the killing%';
Result:
- Episode 7 | Production 115 | Title: the killing (part two) | Original Air Date: 9 November 1966

4) List all episodes with dates to see what aired on 30 November 1966.
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, title, originalairdate 
FROM the_baron 
ORDER BY originalairdate, episode;
Relevant excerpt from results:
- 30 November 1966: Episode 10 — The Legions of Ammak
- 9 November 1966: Episode 7 — The Killing (Part Two)

Findings:
- The episode title is “The Killing (Part Two),” not “The Kill (Part Two).”
- “The Killing (Part Two)” originally aired on 9 November 1966.
- The episode that aired on 30 November 1966 was “The Legions of Ammak.”

Conclusion:
- The claim that “on 30 November 1966, the episode ‘The Kill (Part Two)’ originally aired” is contradicted by the data. The correct air date for “The Killing (Part Two)” is 9 November 1966, and the 30 November 1966 slot belongs to “The Legions of Ammak.”

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the TV series “The Baron.”
- The “originalairdate” field represents the original broadcast date in the authoritative dataset available.
