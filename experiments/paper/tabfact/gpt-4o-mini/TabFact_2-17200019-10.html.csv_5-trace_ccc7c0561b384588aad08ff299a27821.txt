Summary of the claim
Claim interpreted as: There are exactly 4 players who have a total of 3 goals, and all four of those players have league = 5.

Data sources explored
- Connected relational source: public schema
- Available table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
  - Columns: player (text), league (bigint), title playoff (bigint), super cup (bigint), total (bigint)

Schema confirmation
- The database contains the table and columns above (per schema discovery).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count players with total = 3
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count 
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
WHERE total = 3;
- Result: 5 players

2) List players with total = 3 and their league values
- SQL:
SELECT player, league FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3;
- Result:
  - Lucas Biglia — league: 2
  - Dmitri Bulykin — league: 3
  - Jan Polák — league: 2
  - Matías Suárez — league: 1
  - Jelle Van Damme — league: 3

3) Players with league = 5 (and their total goals)
- SQL 1:
SELECT player, league FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE league = 5;
- Result: Jonathan Legear — league: 5
- SQL 2:
SELECT player, total FROM t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE league = 5;
- Result: Jonathan Legear — total: 7

4) Players with total = 3 AND league = 5
- SQL:
SELECT player FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3 AND league = 5;
- Result: No rows

Assessment
- The data shows there are 5 (not 4) players with total = 3 goals.
- None of those players has league = 5; in fact, there are zero players with total = 3 and league = 5.
- There is exactly one player with league = 5 (Jonathan Legear), and his total is 7, not 3.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions made
- “score 3 goal total” is interpreted as players with total = 3 in the total column (total goals across all competitions).
- “be in league 5” is interpreted using the league column in the table (number of league goals), since no separate league identifier or division metadata exists in the dataset. The dataset is restricted to R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season and does not encode league tiers; therefore, the only defensible mapping is league = 5 meaning 5 league goals.
