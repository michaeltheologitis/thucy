Claim to verify: "sewda have the second lowest number of electorate in 2009"

Data sources explored
- Available database contains a single table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency.
- Relevant columns: constituency number (text), name (text), reserved for ( sc / st / none) (text), district (text), number of electorates (2009) (bigint).

Evidence
1) Rank all constituencies by 2009 electorate count (ascending)
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)", ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC) AS rank 
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency;
Key result (from the executed query):
- Rank 1: Sewda — 130,161
- Rank 2: Bhander — 139,600
- Rank 3: Datia — 143,593
- Rank 4: Gohad — 166,893
- Rank 5: Ater — 177,334
- Rank 6: Bhind — 197,183
- Rank 7: Lahar — 205,839
- Rank 8: Mehgaon — 210,649

2) Confirm Sewda’s electorate count
SQL executed:
SELECT "name", "number of electorates (2009)" 
FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
WHERE "name" ILIKE '%Sewda%';
Result: Sewda — 130,161 electorates (2009)

3) Identify the second-lowest constituency
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" ASC LIMIT 2;
Result (ordered ascending):
- 1st: Sewda — 130,161
- 2nd: Bhander — 139,600

Assessment
- The data show Sewda has the lowest electorate count in 2009 (rank 1), not the second lowest. The second lowest is Bhander.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "sewda" refers to the constituency named "Sewda" in the provided dataset.
- The comparison set is the constituencies listed in the table public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency (which includes Sewda and its peers).
