Data source explored: TabFact database, public schema, table atlanta_falcons_draft_history (columns: round, pick, overall, name, position, college).

Step 1: Identify how defensive tackle is labeled and whether it exists in the dataset
- Evidence query (executed SQL):
  SELECT DISTINCT position FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history ORDER BY position ASC;
- Result: Positions present are [cornerback, defensive tackle, guard, linebacker, safety, wide receiver]. This confirms the label “defensive tackle” is used in full text.

Step 2: Retrieve all entries labeled as defensive tackle
- Evidence query (executed SQL):
  SELECT name, pick, overall, round 
  FROM public.atlanta_falcons_draft_history 
  WHERE position = 'defensive tackle' 
  ORDER BY overall ASC;
- Result: Exactly one row found:
  • Name: Corey Peters
  • Pick: 19 (pick within the round)
  • Overall: 83
  • Round: 3

Assessment
- The dataset contains exactly one player with position “defensive tackle,” and that player is Corey Peters with pick number 19 (round pick), overall 83, round 3.
- The user’s name “corey peter” differs by a single letter; the dataset shows “Corey Peters.”

Conclusion
- The claim that the only defensive tackle is Corey Peters with a pick number of 19 is supported by the data in this table. Note: pick number 19 refers to pick within the round; the overall pick was 83.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “corey peter” as “Corey Peters” (exact match in data).
- Interpreted “pick number of 19” as the round pick (column pick), not overall pick.
