Summary
- The claim suggests that “prop Steve Borthwick” is Leicester’s best-known player in that position. Using the available authoritative dataset (2008 Six Nations Championship squads), the evidence shows Steve Borthwick’s position is Lock (not Prop) and his club at that time was Bath (not Leicester). Additionally, there are no records in this dataset showing Borthwick associated with Leicester or listed as a Prop. Within this data environment, the claim is contradicted.

Data sources examined
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with one table: t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads
  - Columns: "player" (text), "position" (text), "date of birth (age)" (text), "caps" (bigint), "club / province" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Steve Borthwick’s position and club in 2008 Six Nations squads
- Finding: Steve Borthwick is listed as Position: Lock; Club/Province: Bath.
- SQL executed:
SELECT "player", "position", "club / province" FROM t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads WHERE "player" ILIKE 'Steve Borthwick';

2) Players with Leicester as their club/province
- Finding: The Leicester-associated players in this dataset are George Chuter (Hooker), Louis Deacon (Lock), Ben Kay (Lock), Tom Croft (Flanker), Lewis Moody (Flanker). No Leicester props are present in this dataset and Steve Borthwick is not among them.
- SQL executed:
SELECT "player", "position", "club / province" 
FROM t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads 
WHERE "club / province" ILIKE '%Leicester%';

3) Any Borthwick listed with Leicester
- Finding: No entries where a player name contains 'Borthwick' and club/province contains 'Leicester'.
- SQL executed:
SELECT "player", "position", "club / province" 
FROM t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads 
WHERE "player" ILIKE '%Borthwick%' 
AND "club / province" ILIKE '%Leicester%'

4) Any Leicester props in this dataset
- Finding: No players listed as Prop with club/province containing Leicester.
- SQL executed:
SELECT player, position, "club / province" 
FROM t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads 
WHERE position ILIKE '%Prop%' 
AND "club / province" ILIKE '%Leicester%';

Assessment
- The dataset shows Steve Borthwick as a Lock playing for Bath in the 2008 Six Nations squads, not a Prop, and not listed with Leicester. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to rugby union, the club Leicester Tigers, and the player Steve Borthwick. “Best known” is subjective; this assessment focuses on factual checks (player position and club association) available in the dataset.
