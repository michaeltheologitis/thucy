What I checked
- Whether the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was the engine used on all Zakspeed chassis from 1985 through 1988.

Evidence from the data
1) Full dataset overview (to understand the context and years available)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM zakspeed;

Result (relevant fields):
- 1985 | chassis: zakspeed 841 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1986 | chassis: zakspeed 861 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1987 | chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1988 | chassis: zakspeed 881 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1989 | chassis: zakspeed 891 | engine (s): yamaha v8

2) Focused retrieval for 1985–1988 (to verify per-year chassis and engine)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, chassis, "engine (s)" 
FROM zakspeed 
WHERE year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1988;

Result:
- 1985 | zakspeed 841 | zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1986 | zakspeed 861 | zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1987 | zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | zakspeed s4 t / c
- 1988 | zakspeed 881 | zakspeed s4 t / c

3) Distinct engines used in 1985–1988 (to ensure there was no variation)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "engine (s)" FROM zakspeed WHERE year BETWEEN 1985 AND 1988;

Result:
- zakspeed s4 t / c (only)

Conclusion
- From 1985 through 1988, every listed chassis (841 in 1985; 861 in 1986; both 861 and 871 in 1987; 881 in 1988) is associated with the engine string “zakspeed s4 t / c.”
- No other engine appears for those years. Therefore, the claim that the Zakspeed S4 T/C engine was used on all chassis from 1985 until 1988 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “All chassis from 1985 until 1988” refers to the Zakspeed Formula One chassis used in those seasons as listed in the dataset (including multiple chassis within a single year, e.g., 1987).
