Claim being checked: “the match with the highest attendance be against Birmingham City.”

Data source explored
- Database: main (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (Sheffield Wednesday FC 2000–01 season matches)

Step 1 — Inspect the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season LIMIT 5;
Observed key columns: Attendance, Date, Opponent, Result, Venue.

Step 2 — Identify the highest-attendance match(es)
Executed SQL:
SELECT Opponent, Attendance, Date, Venue, Result 
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season 
WHERE Attendance = (SELECT MAX(Attendance) FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season);
Result:
- Opponent: Sheffield United; Attendance: 38,433; Date: 1 April 2001; Venue: H; Result: 1 - 2.
Interpretation: The single highest-attendance match in the dataset was against Sheffield United, not Birmingham City.

Step 3 — Context: top attendances
Executed SQL:
SELECT Opponent, Attendance, Date, Venue, Result 
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season 
ORDER BY Attendance DESC 
LIMIT 5;
Top results returned:
1) Sheffield United — 38,433 (1 April 2001, H, 1 - 2)
2) Crewe Alexandra — 28,007 (6 May 2001, H, 0 - 0)
3) Sheffield United — 25,156 (16 December 2000, A, 1 - 1)

5) Nottingham Forest — 23,266 (21 February 2001, A, 1 - 0)

Step 4 — Check matches vs Birmingham City
Executed SQL (case-insensitive search to avoid formatting/casing issues):
SELECT Opponent, Date, Attendance 
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season 
WHERE Opponent ILIKE '%Birmingham%';
Results:
- Birmingham City — 22 October 2000 — Attendance: 14,695
- Birmingham City — 24 March 2001 — Attendance: 19,733
Interpretation: Neither Birmingham City fixture matches the season’s maximum attendance; both are well below 38,433.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows the highest attendance match was Sheffield Wednesday vs Sheffield United (38,433, 1 April 2001, Home).
- Matches vs Birmingham City had attendances of 14,695 and 19,733.
