Claim interpreted: “Annika Sörenstam and Catriona Matthew win with the lowest number of strokes.” I interpret “lowest number of strokes” to mean the record-low aggregate winning score (fewest strokes) in the Women’s British Open history contained in the available dataset.

Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema with table women_s_british_open (Women’s British Open winners and details).
- Key columns: year, venue, champion, score (aggregate strokes), to par, etc.

Evidence
1) Verify Annika Sörenstam’s and Catriona Matthew’s winning scores
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, champion, score, "to par", venue 
  FROM women_s_british_open 
  WHERE champion ILIKE '%annika%' OR champion ILIKE '%catriona%';
- Result:
  • 2003 | Champion: Annika Sörenstam | Score: 278 | To Par: -10 | Venue: Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club
  • 2009 | Champion: Catriona Matthew | Score: 285 | To Par: -3 | Venue: Royal Lytham & St Annes Golf Club

2) Find the lowest winning score (fewest strokes) in the dataset and who holds it
- SQL executed to find min score:
  SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score FROM public.women_s_british_open;
- Result: 269
- SQL executed to list all champions with that score:
  SELECT score, year, champion, venue FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE score = 269;
- Result:
  • Score: 269 | Year: 2004 | Champion: Karen Stupples | Venue: Sunningdale Golf Club

3) Context: the five lowest winning scores in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, champion, score, "to par", venue
  FROM women_s_british_open
  ORDER BY score ASC, year ASC
  LIMIT 5;
- Result (ordered by fewest strokes):
  • 2004 | Karen Stupples | 269 | -19 | Sunningdale Golf Club
  • 2008 | Jiyai Shin | 270 | -18 | Sunningdale Golf Club
  • 2005 | Jeong Jang | 272 | -16 | Royal Birkdale Golf Club
  • 2011 | Yani Tseng | 272 | -16 | Carnoustie Golf Links
  • 2002 | Karrie Webb | 273 | -15 | Turnberry - Ailsa Course

Assessment
- Neither Annika Sörenstam (278) nor Catriona Matthew (285) holds the lowest winning aggregate in this dataset. The record-low winning score is 269 by Karen Stupples (2004). Therefore, the claim that Annika Sörenstam and Catriona Matthew “win with the lowest number of stroke” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Lowest number of stroke” is interpreted as the all-time lowest aggregate winning score in the Women’s British Open (the dataset available).
