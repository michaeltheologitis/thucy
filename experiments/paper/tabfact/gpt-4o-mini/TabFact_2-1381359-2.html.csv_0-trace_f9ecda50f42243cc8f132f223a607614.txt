Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a relevant table containing Japanese university rugby championship seasons.
- Reviewed the schema to understand available fields (season, title, winner, attendance, etc.).
- Queried the dataset for the season that starts with 2000 to verify winner, title number, and attendance availability.

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema
- Relevant table: all_japan_university_rugby_championship

Schema overview (from schema inspection)
- Columns: title (text), season (text), winner (text), score (text), "runner - up" (text), venue (text), attendance (text)

Evidence Query 1: Filter season starting with 2000 (to locate the 2000–01 entry)
SQL executed:
SELECT season, title, winner, attendance 
FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship
WHERE season LIKE '2000%';

Result:
- Season: 2000 - 1 details
- Title: 37th
- Winner: Kanto Gakuin University
- Attendance: n / a

Evidence Query 2: Retrieve full row for confirmation
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE season LIKE '2000%';

Result:
- Title: 37th
- Season: 2000 - 1 details
- Winner: Kanto Gakuin University
- Score: 42 - 15
- Runner-Up: Hosei
- Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo
- Attendance: n/a

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: "during season 2000 - 1 , kanto gakuin university be the winner , the title be 37th and the attendance be not available"
- Findings: The season entry beginning with 2000 matches a record labeled "2000 - 1 details". The winner is Kanto Gakuin University, the title (edition) is 37th, and the attendance field shows n/a, indicating it is not available.
- Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data returned from the database queries.

Assumptions
- "season 2000 - 1" corresponds to the dataset’s season value "2000 - 1 details" (i.e., the 2000–01 season).
- "attendance be not available" is interpreted as an attendance value of n/a (case-insensitive, with or without spacing).
