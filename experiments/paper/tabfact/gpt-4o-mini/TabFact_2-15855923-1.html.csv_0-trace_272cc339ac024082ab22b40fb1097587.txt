Claim to verify: “3 - 2 be the result of the game with a score of 3 - 2.”

Data context
- Available authoritative data source: PostgreSQL database, schema public, table kwak_tae_hwi (columns: date text, venue text, score text, result text, competition text).

Evidence from the database
1) Check all score–result pairs and their counts
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT score, result, COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi 
  GROUP BY score, result 
  ORDER BY score, result;
- Relevant output observation: There is a row with score = '3 - 2', result = '3 - 2', count = 1.

2) Retrieve the row(s) where score = '3 - 2' to confirm the stored result
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, competition, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2';
- Output (summarized):
  - Date: February 17, 2008; Venue: Chongqing, China; Competition: 2008 East Asian Cup; Score: 3 - 2; Result: 3 - 2.

3) Confirm uniqueness and consistency of the result for score = '3 - 2'
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2';
- Executed SQL (distinct result):
  SELECT DISTINCT result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '3 - 2';
- Output: total_rows = 1; distinct result = '3 - 2'.

Conclusion
- The database shows exactly one game with score '3 - 2', and for that game the stored result is also '3 - 2'. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Because the user did not specify a particular competition or dataset, the claim was interpreted and verified against the only available authoritative dataset (public.kwak_tae_hwi). The field “result” in this dataset appears to store a score string for this entry rather than a categorical outcome (e.g., Win/Loss/Draw).
