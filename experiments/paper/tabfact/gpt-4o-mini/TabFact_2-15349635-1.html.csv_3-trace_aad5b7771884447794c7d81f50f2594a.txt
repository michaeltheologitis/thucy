Claim interpreted: “2 of the team have the same number of goal score against them.” Interpreted as: at least two teams share the same goals-against value.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database public with table t_1940_in_brazilian_football.

Schema (public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football):
- position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text)

Evidence 1: Full standings with goals against
- Executed SQL:
SELECT position, team, against FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position;
- Result (Position — Team — Goals Against):
  1 — flamengo — 12
  2 — fluminense — 15
  3 — corinthians — 15
  4 — palestra itália — 19
  5 — portuguesa — 23
  6 — botafogo — 25
  7 — vasco da gama — 19
  8 — américa — 25
  9 — são paulo — 24

Observation: The ‘against’ values 15, 19, and 25 each occur for two teams.

Evidence 2: Identify duplicated goals-against values and team lists
- Executed SQL:
SELECT against, COUNT(team) AS team_count, STRING_AGG(team, ', ') AS team_names
FROM t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY against
HAVING COUNT(team) > 1;
- Result:
  Goals Against 15 — 2 teams — Fluminense, Corinthians
  Goals Against 19 — 2 teams — Palestra Itália, Vasco da Gama
  Goals Against 25 — 2 teams — Botafogo, América

Conclusion:
- The data confirms that there are multiple instances where exactly two teams share the same goals-against value (15, 19, and 25). Therefore, the statement that two teams have the same number of goals scored against them is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- “goal score against them” is interpreted as the ‘against’ column (goals conceded).
- “2 of the team” is interpreted as “at least two teams” (i.e., existence of a pair), not “only two teams in total.”
