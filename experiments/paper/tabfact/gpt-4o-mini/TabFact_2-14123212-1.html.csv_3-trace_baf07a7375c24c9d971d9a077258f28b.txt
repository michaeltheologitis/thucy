Summary
Claim: “w293al have the highest erp w, whereas w264bf have the lowest erp w.”
Finding: Verified within the available dataset (public.whlp). The maximum ERP W is 80 for call sign w293al, and the minimum ERP W is 2 for call sign w264bf. No ties were observed in the results returned by the queries.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: whlp
- Columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (double precision), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine overall maximum and minimum ERP W values
- SQL: SELECT MAX("erp w") AS max_erp_w FROM public.whlp;
  Result: 80
- SQL: SELECT MIN("erp w") AS min_erp_w FROM public.whlp;
  Result: 2

2) Identify the call sign(s) at the maximum ERP W
- SQL: SELECT "call sign", "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "erp w" = 80;
  Result: call sign = w293al, erp w = 80

3) Identify the call sign(s) at the minimum ERP W
- SQL: SELECT "call sign", "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "erp w" = 2;
  Result: call sign = w264bf, erp w = 2

4) Direct check of ERP W for the two specific call signs
- SQL: SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" = 'w293al';
  Result: 80
- SQL: SELECT "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" = 'w264bf';
  Result: 2

Conclusion
- The data show w293al has the highest ERP W (80) and w264bf has the lowest ERP W (2) within the table public.whlp. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “erp w” refers to the column "erp w" (bigint) in public.whlp and is measured in watts.
- “Highest/lowest” refers to values within the scope of the available dataset (public.whlp).
