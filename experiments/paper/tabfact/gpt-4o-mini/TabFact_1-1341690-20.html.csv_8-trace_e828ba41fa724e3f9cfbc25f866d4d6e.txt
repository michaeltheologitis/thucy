Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974. Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), result (text), candidates (text).

Evidence gathered
1) Maryland’s 6th Congressional District (1974)
- Result returned: District: Maryland 6; Incumbent: Goodloe Byron; Result: Re-elected; Candidates: Goodloe Byron (D) 73.7%, Elton R. Wampler (R) 26.3%.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, result, candidates FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district = 'Maryland 6';

2) Search for references to Elton R. Wampler in 1974 data
- Result returned: The Maryland 6 row above includes Elton R. Wampler (R) as the challenger.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Elton%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Wampler%';

Assessment
- In the 1974 U.S. House election for Maryland’s 6th district, the incumbent Goodloe Byron was re-elected. Elton R. Wampler appears as the Republican challenger with 26.3% of the vote. This directly contradicts the notion that Wampler “succeeded” the incumbent in that election cycle. Within the scope of the available (1974) data, Elton R. Wampler did not succeed Goodloe Byron.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the U.S. House of Representatives, Maryland’s 6th district, and “succeed” meaning to win the seat following (i.e., replace) the incumbent. Available verified data covers the 1974 election only. No later election data (e.g., 1976, 1978) was available in the accessible sources for this verification.
