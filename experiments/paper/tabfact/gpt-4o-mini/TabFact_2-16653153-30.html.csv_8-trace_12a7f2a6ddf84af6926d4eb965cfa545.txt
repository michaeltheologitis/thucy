Conclusion
- In the available 2008–09 NBL season data, Gold Coast Blaze do not have the best record. The best record belongs to the South Dragons (73.33% won). Gold Coast Blaze are last among the listed teams by winning percentage (26.67% won, 22 losses).

Assumptions
- "the season" is interpreted as the 2008–09 NBL season because it is the only season available in the connected data source.
- "best record" is defined as the highest winning percentage (% won).
- Team name matching is case-insensitive and exact for "Gold Coast Blaze".
