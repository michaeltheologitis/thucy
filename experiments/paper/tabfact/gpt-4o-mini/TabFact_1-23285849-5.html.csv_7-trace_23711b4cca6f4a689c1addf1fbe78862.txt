Result excerpt includes several Pepsi Center entries with attendance below and above 19,000:
- november 1 | grizzlies | w 133 - 123 (ot) | pepsi center 15823
- november 13 | lakers | w 105 - 79 (ot) | pepsi center 19141
- november 17 | raptors | w 130 - 112 (ot) | pepsi center 16446
- november 21 | bulls | w 112 - 93 (ot) | pepsi center 19359

- november 27 | knicks | w 128 - 125 (ot) | pepsi center 19155

2) All games at Pepsi Center with parsed attendance (functions.nl_query_traceable)
SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent, CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%pepsi center%'
ORDER BY game;
Returned rows:

3) Attendance statistics at Pepsi Center (functions.nl_query_traceable)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', 3) AS INTEGER)) AS min_attendance,
       MAX(CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', 3) AS INTEGER)) AS max_attendance,
       AVG(CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', 3) AS INTEGER)) AS avg_attendance,
       COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', 3) AS INTEGER) < 19000) AS below_19000
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE "location attendance" LIKE 'pepsi center %';
Results:
- Minimum Attendance: 15823
- Maximum Attendance: 19359
- Average Attendance: 17705.17
- Games below 19000: 3

Conclusion
- The data clearly shows multiple Pepsi Center games with attendance below 19,000 (e.g., 15,823; 16,446; 16,307). Therefore, the claim that attendance of all games at the Pepsi Center is over 19,000 is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Scope is limited to the available dataset: Denver Nuggets 2009–2010 season table in this database.
- "Games at the Pepsi Center" are identified by rows where the location attendance field contains the substring "pepsi center".
- Attendance is the trailing integer in the location attendance field, extracted via substring/regex.
