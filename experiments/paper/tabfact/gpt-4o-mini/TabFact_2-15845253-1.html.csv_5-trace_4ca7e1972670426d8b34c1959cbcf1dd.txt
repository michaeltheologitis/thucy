Claim to verify: "9 of the viral disease replicate in the nucleus"

Interpretation: We interpret this as stating that there are 9 entries in the available viral_disease dataset whose replication site is recorded as "nucleus".

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: viral_disease
  - Columns: "family" (text), "baltimore group" (text), "envelopment" (text), "virion shape" (text), "replication site" (text)

Evidence from data:
1) Count of entries with replication in the nucleus
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS viral_count, "replication site" FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus' GROUP BY "replication site";
Result: viral_count = 9 (replication site = nucleus)

2) Distribution of entries by replication site (context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "replication site", COUNT(*) as record_count FROM viral_disease GROUP BY "replication site";
Results:
- Cytoplasm: 14
- Nucleus: 9

3) Distinct families recorded as replicating in the nucleus (for transparency)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "family" FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
Results (9): Adenoviridae; Hepadnaviridae; Herpesviridae; Orthomyxoviridae; Papillomaviridae; Parvoviridae; Polyomaviridae; Retroviridae; Unassigned

Conclusion: The dataset shows 9 records with replication site = nucleus, supporting the claim.

Assumptions:
- "viral disease" refers to entries in the viral_disease table. The table appears to list virus families (or similar categories), and we treat each row as a "viral disease" entry for counting.
- Replication site values are taken as-is from the "replication site" column, where an entry labeled "nucleus" indicates nuclear replication.
