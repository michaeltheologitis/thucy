Summary of what the claim asserts (interpreted as separate specs for TAM-family variants):
- VCLC weighs 32 t (35.3 tons).
- VCLC armament consists of 160 mm (6.3 in) or 350 mm (13.8 in) rockets.
- VCPC is equipped with a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun.
- VCRT is equipped with a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun.

Evidence from the data
Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema with a single table: tam_tank.

Schema details (tool: schema_query):
- Table: public.tam_tank
  Columns (all text): vctp, vca 155, vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt
  No primary/foreign keys.

Query 1: Show all rows to locate variant specifications
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
Key returned values (excerpt):
- vclc: 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets
- vcpc: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun
- vcrt: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun
- vctp: 28.2 t (31.1 tons)
- vctm: 26t (28.7tons)
- vca 155: 40t (44.1tons)

Query 2: Find weight entry for VCLC (32 t / 35.3 tons)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank WHERE vclc ILIKE '%t%' OR vclc ILIKE '%tons%';
Key returned values (excerpt of relevant row):
- vclc: 32t (35.3tons)
- vcpc: 25t (27.6tons)
- vcrt: 32t (35.3tons)
- vctp: 28.2 t (31.1 tons)
- vctm: 26t (28.7tons)
- vca 155: 40t (44.1tons)

Query 3: Extract columns for VCPC, VCLC, and VCRT across rows to show armament and weights
SQL executed:
SELECT vcpc, vclc, vcrt FROM public.tam_tank WHERE vcpc IS NOT NULL OR vclc IS NOT NULL OR vcrt IS NOT NULL;
Key returned values (combined across rows):
- Weights: vcpc: 25t (27.6tons); vclc: 32t (35.3tons); vcrt: 32t (35.3tons)
- Armament: vcpc: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun; vclc: 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets; vcrt: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun

Assessment of each sub-claim against the data
- VCLC 32 t (35.3 tons): Supported. See Query 2 (vclc: 32t (35.3tons)).
- VCLC uses 160 mm or 350 mm rockets: Supported. See Query 1 and Query 3 (vclc: 160 mm (6.3in) or 350 mm (13.8in) rockets).
- VCPC has a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun: Supported. See Query 1 and Query 3 (vcpc: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun).
- VCRT has a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun: Supported. See Query 1 and Query 3 (vcrt: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun).

Notes on potentially ambiguous phrasing
- The phrase “have the same vcpc” is unclear. If it implies that VCLC and VCPC have the same weight or the same primary armament, that would not be supported by the data (VCPC weight is 25 t, VCLC weight is 32 t; VCLC’s listed primary armament is rocket launchers, while VCPC is listed with a 7.62 mm MG). If, instead, the statement lists each variant’s own spec (as interpreted above), the data fully supports those listed specs.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user message as a list of specifications for different TAM-family variants (VCLC, VCPC, VCRT), rather than claiming equality between VCPC and VCLC attributes.
- Treated 7.62 mm = 0.3 in and 160 mm = 6.3 in; 350 mm = 13.8 in as given in the database text, without additional conversion checks, since the database is authoritative per instructions.
