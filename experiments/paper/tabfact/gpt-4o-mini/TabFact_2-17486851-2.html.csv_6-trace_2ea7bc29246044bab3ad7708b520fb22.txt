Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources, then inspected the schema of the only available table to understand relevant fields (notably nat and type). I then queried for rows where type is “retirement” and separately examined the record(s) where nat = 'por' to compare their type values.

Data source discovery
- Tool: Data source discovery
- Finding: One PostgreSQL schema (public) with a single table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season (APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season transfers dataset).

Schema inspection
- Tool: Schema query
- Table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
- Columns: nat (text), name (text), "moving to" (text), type (text), "transfer window" (text), "transfer fee" (text), source (text)
- No explicit keys/constraints reported.

Evidence 1: Records where type indicates retirement
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE type = 'retirement';
- Result (1 row):
  - nat: gre; name: machlas; moving to: retired; type: retirement; transfer window: summer; transfer fee: -; source: contragr

Evidence 2: Distinct nationalities (to confirm presence of 'por')
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS record_count FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY nat;
- Result excerpt: bra:1; cyp:6; gre:2; mkd:1; por:1; ser:1

Evidence 3: Record(s) with nat = 'por' and their type value
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'por';
- Result (1 row):
  - Name: Paulo Costa; Moving To: Anorthosis Famagusta; Nationality: por; Transfer Window: Winter; Transfer Fee: Free; Type: Mutual consent loan return; Source: apoelfccomcy

Assessment of the claim
- Interpreting the user’s statement as the claim: “For POR (Portugal), the type is retirement.”
- The data show the only 'por' record has type = "Mutual consent loan return", not "retirement". While the dataset does contain a retirement record, it is for nat = gre (Greece), not por.

Conclusion
- The claim that the POR type is retirement is contradicted by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “por” is interpreted as the nationality code in the nat column (Portugal), consistent with other FIFA-style codes (e.g., gre, bra, cyp).
- The user intent is taken to be a verification that the type for the POR record equals “retirement,” within the scope of the available APOEL 2008–09 season transfer table.
