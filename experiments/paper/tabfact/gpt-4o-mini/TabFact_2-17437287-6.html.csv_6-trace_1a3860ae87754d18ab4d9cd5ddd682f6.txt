Claim interpreted: The user asserts that when Birmingham City are the home team, the score is 0-0. I verify this against the available data (FA Cup 1983-84 table).

Data source explored:
- Database: public schema
- Table: t_1983_84_fa_cup (columns: "tie no" text, "home team" text, "score" text, "away team" text, "date" text)

Evidence 1: List all FA Cup 1983-84 matches with Birmingham City as home team
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team" FROM public.t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE lower("home team") = 'birmingham city';
Result:
- Tie No: 4; Date: 10 March 1984; Home Team: Birmingham City; Score: 1 - 3; Away Team: Watford

Evidence 2: Count Birmingham City home matches with score 0-0 (handling common dash variants and ignoring spaces)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_1983_84_fa_cup WHERE lower("home team") = 'birmingham city' AND regexp_replace(score, '\s', '', 'g') IN ('0-0','0–0','0—0','0-0')
Result:
- Count: 0

Conclusion based on data:
- In the FA Cup 1983-84 dataset, Birmingham City had one home match (vs Watford) with a score of 1 - 3. There are zero Birmingham City home matches with a 0-0 score.

Assumptions:
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (FA Cup 1983-84). No other seasons or competitions are included because they are not present in the connected data sources.
