Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that, in 2006, Glo Mobile had 11,000 (thousands) subscribers and a growth rate of 52%.

Data source explored: Database mobile_telephony_in_africa, table mobile_telephony_in_africa with columns: provider, country, subscribers (2005) (thousands), subscribers (2006) (thousands), growth %.

Evidence 1: Retrieve 2006 subscribers and growth for Glo Mobile
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %"
FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE provider ILIKE '%Glo%' OR provider ILIKE '%Globacom%';

Result:
- Provider: Glo Mobile
- Country: Nigeria
- Subscribers (2006) (thousands): 11,000
- Growth (%): 22

Evidence 2: Cross-check 2005 vs 2006 to validate growth
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %"
FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE provider ILIKE 'Glo Mobile' AND country ILIKE 'Nigeria';

Result:
- Provider: Glo Mobile
- Subscribers (2005) (thousands): 9,000
- Subscribers (2006) (thousands): 11,000
- Growth (%): 22
Computed growth from raw values: ((11,000 − 9,000) / 9,000) × 100 ≈ 22.22%, consistent with the recorded 22% and not 52%.

Conclusion:
- Correct: Glo Mobile had 11,000 (thousands) subscribers in 2006 (i.e., 11,000,000 subscribers).
- Incorrect: The growth rate was 22% (≈22.22%), not 52%.

Assumptions made:
- “Glo Mobile” refers to the Nigerian operator (also known as Globacom/Glo).
- “11000” is interpreted in the same units as the dataset column “subscribers (2006) (thousands)”.
- “growth 52” refers to percentage growth from 2005 to 2006 as captured in the “growth %” column.
