Claim interpreted: The difference between the highest and lowest game attendance (crowd) is 31,521.

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record)

Findings:
- Minimum attendance: 22,616
- Maximum attendance: 54,137
- Difference (max - min): 31,521

Supporting evidence and executed SQL:
1) Minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result: 22616

2) Maximum attendance
SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result: 54137

3) Difference between maximum and minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) - MIN(attendance) AS attendance_difference FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result: 31521

Additional context (games corresponding to min/max attendance):
4) Game with minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
ORDER BY attendance ASC
LIMIT 1;
Result: September 17 vs Giants — attendance 22,616

5) Game with maximum attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season
ORDER BY attendance DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result: September 7 vs Dodgers — attendance 54,137

Conclusion: The computed difference is 31,521, which matches the claim.
