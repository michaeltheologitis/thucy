Claim to verify: “Italy receive 3 more gold medal than Canada do but tie with the United State and West Germany.”

Scope and data source
- Available data: A PostgreSQL table public.t_1988_winter_olympics containing the 1988 Winter Olympics medal table by nation (rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total).

Evidence
1) Nations and gold medal counts (1988 Winter Olympics)
Executed SQL:
SELECT nation, gold FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics ORDER BY rank;

Result excerpt relevant to the claim (from the query output):
- West Germany (FRG): 2 gold medals
- United States (USA): 2 gold medals
- Italy (ITA): 2 gold medals
- Canada (CAN): 0 gold medals

Analysis against the claim
- “Italy receive 3 more gold medal than Canada”: Data shows Italy = 2, Canada = 0. Difference = 2, not 3. This part is incorrect.
- “but tie with the United State and West Germany”: Data shows Italy = 2, United States = 2, West Germany = 2. This part is correct.

Conclusion
- The tie portion is supported by the data, but the numerical difference vs. Canada is incorrect by 1 gold medal.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1988 Winter Olympics because the only accessible dataset pertains to that event.
- “United State” interpreted as “United States (USA)” and “West Germany” as “FRG (West Germany)”.
