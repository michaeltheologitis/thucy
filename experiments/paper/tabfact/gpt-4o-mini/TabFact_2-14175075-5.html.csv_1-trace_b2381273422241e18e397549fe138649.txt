Summary conclusion
- Volleyball is the sport associated with the second earliest distinct chronological date in the available dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series.

Schema overview (as reported by schema inspection)
- Table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  - date (text)
  - site (text)
  - sport (text)
  - winning team (text)
  - series (text)
- Note: The date column is text; therefore, correct chronological comparisons require parsing to a date type.

Method to parse dates
- Used a robust parse to handle spacing and case in month names:
  TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')

Evidence 1: Earliest five distinct dates
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  ORDER BY parsed_date
  LIMIT 5;
- Result:
  1) 2007-09-04
  2) 2007-09-08
  3) 2007-09-09
  4) 2007-09-15
  5) 2007-11-10

Evidence 2: Rows on or before 2007-09-10 (to show which sports appear on the very earliest dates)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\\s*,\\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date, date, sport 
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
  WHERE TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\\s*,\\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') <= '2007-09-10' 
  ORDER BY parsed_date ASC, sport;
- Result:
  - 2007-09-04 | september 4 , 2007 | m golf
  - 2007-09-08 | september 8 , 2007 | volleyball
  - 2007-09-09 | september 9 , 2007 | w soccer

Evidence 3: Second earliest distinct date and all sports on that date
- SQL executed (to identify the second earliest date):
  SELECT DISTINCT TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  ORDER BY parsed_date
  OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
- Returned: 2007-09-08

- SQL executed (to list sports on 2007-09-08):
  SELECT DISTINCT sport
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  WHERE TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER(date), '\s*,\s*', ', '), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') = '2007-09-08';
- Result: volleyball

Conclusion
- The second earliest distinct chronological date in the dataset is 2007-09-08, and the sport on that date is volleyball. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the 2nd earliest date” as the second distinct earliest chronological date across the entire iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series table, after parsing the textual date field into a proper date. If multiple events occurred on the same date, all sports on that date would be considered; in this case, only volleyball appears on 2007-09-08.
