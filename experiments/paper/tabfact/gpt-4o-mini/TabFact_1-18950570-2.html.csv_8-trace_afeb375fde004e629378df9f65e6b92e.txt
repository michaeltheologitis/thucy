Claim to verify: “In the period where there are 1,086,000 deaths per year, the CDR is 22.6.”

Summary of findings:
- The database contains exactly one period where deaths per year equals 1,086,000 (after removing formatting). For that period (1995–2000), the crude death rate (cdr) is 6.5, not 22.6.
- There are no records with cdr approximately equal to 22.6 in the table.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Identify the period(s) where deaths per year = 1,086,000 (ignoring commas/spaces/periods), and list the CDR
SQL:
SELECT period, "deaths per year", cdr
FROM my_info_table
WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("deaths per year", ',', ''), ' ', ''), '.', '')::INTEGER = 1086000;
Result:
- period: 1995 - 2000; deaths per year: 1 086 000; cdr: 6.5

2) Count how many rows match deaths per year = 1,086,000 (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM my_info_table
WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(REPLACE("deaths per year", ',', ''), ' ', ''), '.', '')::INTEGER = 1086000;
Result:
- row_count: 1

3) Check if any row has cdr approximately equal to 22.6
SQL:
SELECT period, "deaths per year", cdr
FROM my_info_table
WHERE cdr BETWEEN 22.5 AND 22.7;
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion:
- The data shows that when deaths per year is 1,086,000, the cdr is 6.5, not 22.6. No evidence supports a cdr of 22.6 in the dataset.

Assumptions:
- “deaths per year” refers to the column "deaths per year" in my_info_table and numeric comparisons ignore formatting symbols (commas, spaces, periods).
- “CDR” refers to the cdr (crude death rate) column in my_info_table, measured as provided by the dataset.
