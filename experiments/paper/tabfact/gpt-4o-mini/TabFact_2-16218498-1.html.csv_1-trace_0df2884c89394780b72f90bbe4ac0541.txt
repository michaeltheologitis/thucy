Objective
Assess whether the 4th game on the list is a higher-scoring game than the 6th game, based on available data.

Data discovery and schema
- Discovered data source: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs).
- Table columns (all text): team 1, 1st leg, 2nd leg, agg, team 2. No keys defined.

Evidence retrieved
To inspect score formats and determine the ordering of entries, I retrieved the first 10 rows:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt (relevant first three ties):
  1) team 1: botswana defence force xi | 1st leg: 1 - 1 | 2nd leg: 0 - 1 | agg: 1 - 2 | team 2: mbabane highlanders
  2) team 1: arsenal (maseru)          | 1st leg: 3 - 0 | 2nd leg: 1 - 0 | agg: 4 - 0 | team 2: eleven arrows fc
  3) team 1: cd elá nguema             | 1st leg: 2 - 3 | 2nd leg: 0 - 3 1 | agg: 2 - 6 | team 2: primeiro de agosto

Method and calculation
- I interpret “the list” of games as the sequential list formed by unpivoting each pairing’s two legs, ordered by:
  1) The table’s row order as retrieved by the query above, and
  2) Within each pairing, the 1st leg precedes the 2nd leg.
- “Higher scoring” is interpreted as having a greater total number of goals in that game (sum of the two teams’ goals in that leg).
- Parsing scores uses the first two integers in the score text. For example, "0 - 3 1" is treated as 0 and 3, totaling 3 goals.

Enumerating the first six games under this ordering:
- Tie 1 (botswana defence force xi vs mbabane highlanders)
  • Game 1 (1st leg): 1 - 1 → total goals = 2
  • Game 2 (2nd leg): 0 - 1 → total goals = 1
- Tie 2 (arsenal (maseru) vs eleven arrows fc)
  • Game 3 (1st leg): 3 - 0 → total goals = 3
  • Game 4 (2nd leg): 1 - 0 → total goals = 1
- Tie 3 (cd elá nguema vs primeiro de agosto)
  • Game 5 (1st leg): 2 - 3 → total goals = 5
  • Game 6 (2nd leg): 0 - 3 1 → treated as 0 - 3 → total goals = 3

Comparison
- 4th game total goals: 1
- 6th game total goals: 3
- Result: 1 is not greater than 3. Therefore, the 4th game is not higher scoring than the 6th game.

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data. The 4th game has fewer total goals than the 6th game.

Executed SQL evidence
- Query: SELECT * FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs LIMIT 10;
- Purpose: Establish the row order and retrieve the 1st/2nd leg scores for the first three pairings, from which the first six individual games are derived.

Assumptions
- The “list” ordering is based on the row order returned by the SELECT without ORDER BY and, within each row, 1st leg precedes 2nd leg.
- “Higher scoring game” means the game (leg) with the greater sum of goals scored by both teams.
- In score strings with extra tokens (e.g., “0 - 3 1”), only the first two integers are used as the goals for the two teams.
