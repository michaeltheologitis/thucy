Claim to verify: "the average score for player from japan be 251"

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text, money bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify whether Japan exists as a country value
- Result: Japan is present among country values.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf;

2) Retrieve all Japanese players and their scores
- Result: 1 row
  • Player: Masashi Ozaki | Country: Japan | Score: "70 + 71 + 68 + 72 = 281"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country, score FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf WHERE country ILIKE '%Japan%';

Computation
- The dataset shows one Japanese player with a total score of 281. Therefore, the average score for players from Japan in this dataset is 281.

Conclusion
- The claim that the average score for players from Japan is 251 is not supported by the data. The evidence shows an average of 281.

Assumptions
- "Player from Japan" is interpreted as rows where country = 'Japan'.
- "Score" refers to the total four-round score indicated at the end of the score text (e.g., the number after '=').
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the 1989 U.S. Open Golf dataset contained in table t_1989_u_s_open_golf.
