Claim to verify
- Player greg monroe (7) had the highest number of rebounds, and player rodney stuckey (16) had the highest number of points in the game.

Data sources explored
- Database: public schema
- Table: t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season (columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record)

Understanding the data format
To ensure correct matching, I first inspected how the "high points" and "high rebounds" fields are formatted.
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season LIMIT 10;
SELECT DISTINCT "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season LIMIT 10;
Key sample values returned:
- High points values include: "rodney stuckey (16)", "rodney stuckey (25)", "rodney stuckey (34)", etc.
- High rebounds values include: "greg monroe (7)", "greg monroe (8)", etc.

Direct verification
I then searched for any game where both conditions were true simultaneously.
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" = 'greg monroe (7)'
AND "high points" = 'rodney stuckey (16)';
Result (single matching game):
- Date: October 11
- Game: 3
- Team: Atlanta
- Score: W 94 - 85 (OT)
- High Points: rodney stuckey (16)
- High Rebounds: greg monroe (7)
- High Assists: richard hamilton (7)
- Location Attendance: The Palace of Auburn Hills 10591
- Record: 2 - 1

Uniqueness check
To confirm whether there were multiple such games, I counted matches.
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count
FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "high rebounds" = 'greg monroe (7)' AND "high points" = 'rodney stuckey (16)';
Result: 1 game

Assessment
- The data shows exactly one game in which Greg Monroe led the team in rebounds with 7 and Rodney Stuckey led the team in points with 16. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the 2010-11 Detroit Pistons season table.

Assumptions
- “the game” refers to any game within the 2010-11 Detroit Pistons season reflected in the provided table. The claim does not specify a date or opponent; I verified existence of such a game in the dataset and confirmed there is exactly one instance.
