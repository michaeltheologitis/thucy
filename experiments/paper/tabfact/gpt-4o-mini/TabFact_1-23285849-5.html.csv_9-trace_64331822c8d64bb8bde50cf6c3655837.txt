Claim to verify: “Ty Lawson led or tied for the lead in assists in 10 out of 13 games.”

Interpretation used for verification:
- “Led or tied for the lead in assists” means the player appears in the table’s “high assists” field for a game (which lists the player(s) with the most assists for that game). Ties are included if multiple names appear.
- The available authoritative data source covers the Denver Nuggets 2009–10 season (public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season). We verify the claim against the 13 games present in this dataset.

Data source and key fields:
- Table: public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
- Relevant columns: game (game number), date, team (opponent), high assists (text listing player name(s) with assist count)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Total number of games in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season;
Result: 13

2) Number of games where Ty Lawson is listed among the high assists leaders (case-insensitive search)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS high_assists_count
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE LOWER("high assists") LIKE '%ty lawson%';
Result: 2

3) Which games feature Ty Lawson as a leader/tied leader in assists
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "high assists"
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE LOWER("high assists") LIKE '%ty lawson%'
ORDER BY game;
Results:
- Game 9 | Date: November 11 | Team: Bucks | High Assists: Chauncey Billups, Ty Lawson (5)
- Game 15 | Date: November 25 | Team: Timberwolves | High Assists: Nenê, Ty Lawson (6)

Analysis:
- The dataset contains 13 games. Ty Lawson appears as the team’s assists leader (including ties) in only 2 of those 13 games. Therefore, the claim that he led or tied for the lead in 10 out of 13 games is not supported by the data.
- Given there are only 2 such appearances in total, no 13-game window in this dataset can yield 10 occurrences.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions and notes:
- The phrasing of the claim is ambiguous regarding timeframe and team context. I assumed it refers to the games present in the authoritative dataset we have (Denver Nuggets 2009–10 season entries available in the table). If the claim intended a different team/league or a different stretch of games, that would require a different dataset; however, per instructions, conclusions are based strictly on the accessible data here.
