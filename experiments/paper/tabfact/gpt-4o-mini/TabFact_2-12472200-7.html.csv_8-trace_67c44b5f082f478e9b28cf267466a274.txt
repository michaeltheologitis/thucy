Claim to verify: “From 2007–2011, Olga Govortsova’s WTA year-end ranking has always gone up.”

Summary finding: The data shows Olga Govortsova’s year-end WTA rankings as 49 (2007), 49 (2008), 52 (2009), 74 (2010), and 114 (2011). This does not support the claim under either common interpretation of “go up.” If “go up” means improve (i.e., a lower number), her ranking did not improve; it stayed the same from 2007 to 2008 and then worsened each subsequent year. If “go up” means increase numerically (i.e., a higher, worse ranking number), it still did not “always” go up because 2007 to 2008 remained the same (49 to 49).

Data exploration and evidence
1) Explore table contents to understand structure
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova LIMIT 20;

Result (excerpted):
- Columns observed: tournament, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 (text), with rows representing categories like grand slam tournaments, australian open, french open, win - loss, etc. This established that the table contains year-labeled columns including a row for year-end rankings.

2) Retrieve year-end ranking row
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament ILIKE '%rank%' OR tournament ILIKE '%ranking%' OR tournament ILIKE '%year-end%';

Result:
- tournament: year end ranking
  - 2007: 49
  - 2008: 49
  - 2009: 52
  - 2010: 74
  - 2011: 114

Assessment against the claim
- Interpreting “go up” as improve (lower number): 49 → 49 (no improvement), then 49 → 52 → 74 → 114 (worse each year). Not always going up; overall it declines.
- Interpreting “go up” as increase numerically (higher number): 49 → 49 (no increase) → 52 → 74 → 114. Not “always” going up because 2007 to 2008 is unchanged.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Go up” is commonly used to mean improvement in rank (lower numeric position). I also evaluated the alternate interpretation (higher numeric value) for completeness, and the claim still fails due to the 2007→2008 tie.
