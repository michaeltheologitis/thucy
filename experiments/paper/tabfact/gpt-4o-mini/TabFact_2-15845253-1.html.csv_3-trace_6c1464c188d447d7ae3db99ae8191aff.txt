Claim: “13 viral family have an icosahedral virion shape.”

Step 1 — Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a single table public.viral_disease (discovered via tool). 
- Schema (via schema tool):
  - Table: public.viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Step 2 — Explore how virion shapes are represented
- Purpose: Confirm how “icosahedral” appears in the data.
- Executed SQL:
  - SELECT DISTINCT "virion shape" FROM viral_disease;
- Result (from tool): helical; spherical; complex; helical , bullet shaped; icosahedral
- Interpretation: “icosahedral” is a distinct, exact value in the virion shape column.

Step 3 — Count distinct families with icosahedral virion shape
- Executed SQL:
  - SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';
- Result: 13 distinct families.

Step 4 — List those families
- Executed SQL:
  - SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral' ORDER BY family;
- Result (alphabetical):
  - adenoviridae
  - astroviridae
  - caliciviridae
  - flaviviridae
  - hepadnaviridae
  - hepeviridae
  - papillomaviridae
  - parvoviridae
  - picornaviridae
  - polyomaviridae
  - reoviridae
  - retroviridae
  - togaviridae

Cross-check (initial retrieval of families)
- Executed SQL:
  - SELECT family FROM viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';
- Result: Returns rows that correspond to the 13 families above (tool confirmed total of 13 families).

Conclusion
- The database shows exactly 13 distinct viral families labeled with virion shape = icosahedral. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “viral family have an icosahedral virion shape” as counting distinct values in the family field where the virion shape column equals the exact value 'icosahedral'.
- No normalization beyond exact match was applied because the data already contains 'icosahedral' as a distinct category separate from others like 'helical' or 'complex'.
