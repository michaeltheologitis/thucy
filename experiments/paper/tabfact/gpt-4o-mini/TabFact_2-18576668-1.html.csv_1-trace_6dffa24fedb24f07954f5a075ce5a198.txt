Claim interpreted: The only invitational event type occurs in the 2005 season in Los Angeles (within the available dataset TabFact.public.tsuyoshi_fujita).

Data source exploration
- Discovered database: TabFact, schema: public, table: tsuyoshi_fujita
- Columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)

Evidence
1) Table size and preview (shows an invitational row in 2005 at Los Angeles)
- SQL (row count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita;
- Result: 21 rows
- SQL (preview ordered by date):
  SELECT * FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 50;
- Preview excerpt includes:
  17 - 20 may 2005 | invitational | special | los angeles | 2 | 2005

2) Count rows where event type = 'invitational'
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE "event type" = 'invitational';
- Result: 1

3) Retrieve the invitational row’s season and location
- SQL:
  SELECT season, location FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE "event type" = 'invitational';
- Result: season = 2005, location = Los Angeles

4) Distinct event types and counts (to verify uniqueness of invitational)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "event type", COUNT(*) as count 
  FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita 
  GROUP BY "event type";
- Result: grand prix = 12, pro tour = 4, nationals = 2, apac region championship = 1, masters = 1, invitational = 1

Assessment
- There is exactly one row with event type = 'invitational'.
- That single invitational entry is in season 2005 and located in Los Angeles.
- Therefore, the claim is fully supported by the data in this table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the events recorded in the TabFact.public.tsuyoshi_fujita table and uses exact string matching for event type ('invitational'), season ('2005'), and location ('Los Angeles').
