What I verified
- Claim interpreted: Within the available 1972 VFL (Victorian Football League) season dataset, determine whether the Melbourne Football Club recorded the lowest single-game total score by any away team.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database with schema public
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
  - Note: Scores are strings in the format like 8.10 (58); the numeric total points are inside parentheses.

Method
- Parse the numeric total points from the away-team score by extracting the digits inside parentheses and casting to integer, then compute minima.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Overall minimum away-team total and the matches with that minimum
- Result: The minimum away-team total points is 58. The matching game is:
  - Home Team: Collingwood; Home Team Score: 10.13 (73)
  - Away Team: Melbourne; Away Team Score: 8.10 (58)
  - Venue: VFL Park; Crowd: 30883; Date: 15 July 1972
- Executed SQL:
WITH parsed_away_points AS (
    SELECT 
        "home team", 
        "home team score", 
        "away team", 
        "away team score", 
        "venue", 
        "crowd", 
        "date",
        CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS away_points
    FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT * 
FROM parsed_away_points 
WHERE away_points = (SELECT MIN(away_points) FROM parsed_away_points);

2) Minimum away-team total per team (to check if any team ties or beats Melbourne)
- Result (lowest minima shown by the tool):
  - melbourne: 58
  - south melbourne: 63
  - st kilda: 65
  - north melbourne: 66
  - geelong: 98
  - richmond: 111
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "away team", MIN(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS min_away_points
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
GROUP BY "away team"
ORDER BY min_away_points ASC;

3) Minimum away-team total for Melbourne specifically
- Result: 58
- Executed SQL:
WITH parsed_away_points AS (
    SELECT 
        "home team", 
        "home team score", 
        "away team", 
        "away team score", 
        "venue", 
        "crowd", 
        "date",
        CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS away_points
    FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
)
SELECT MIN(away_points) AS min_away_points
FROM parsed_away_points 
WHERE "away team" = 'melbourne';

Conclusion
- Melbourne recorded the lowest away-team score in the dataset (58 points), and no other team had an away-team total as low or lower in the available records. This supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions
- “melbourne” refers to the Melbourne Football Club (VFL/AFL club) and the scope is the available 1972 VFL season dataset.
- “lowest score when playing as the away team” refers to the lowest single-game total points scored by any away team, not an average across matches.
- Scores are correctly parsed from the numeric total inside parentheses.
- Team name case in the database can vary; comparisons are on the literal strings present in the dataset.
