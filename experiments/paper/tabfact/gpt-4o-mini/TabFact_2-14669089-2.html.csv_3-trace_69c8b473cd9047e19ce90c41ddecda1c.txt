Claim to verify: “At 459 feet, the Schiesinger [Schlesinger] Building is the fourth largest [tallest] building in Johannesburg.”

Summary of findings
- The Schlesinger Building in Johannesburg is listed at 361 feet (110 metres) in the data.
- A Johannesburg building at 459 feet exists in the data, but it is the “Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1, Trust Bank Building,” not the Schlesinger Building.
- Within the Johannesburg entries returned from the dataset, the Schlesinger Building ranks 4th by height, but it is not 459 feet tall.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL
1) Identify Schlesinger Building height and city
SQL:
SELECT name, city, feet, metres 
FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Schlesinger%';

Result:
- Name: schlesinger building | City: johannesburg | Feet: 361 | Metres: 110

2) List Johannesburg buildings and heights (filtering by city substring to capture all relevant entries) and sort by height
SQL:
SELECT name, city, feet, metres 
FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa 
WHERE LOWER(city) LIKE '%johannes%' 
ORDER BY feet DESC;

Results (excerpt):
1. Carlton Centre | Johannesburg | 732 ft | 223 m
2. Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1, Trust Bank Building | Johannesburg | 459 ft | 140 m
3. Standard Bank Building | Johannesburg | 455 ft | 138.8 m
4. Schlesinger Building | Johannesburg | 361 ft | 110 m
5. Chamber of Mines Building | Johannesburg | 262 ft | 80 m

3) Compute rank by height among Johannesburg entries
SQL:
SELECT name, city, feet, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY feet DESC) AS rank 
FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa 
WHERE LOWER(city) LIKE '%johannes%' 
ORDER BY rank;

Results (ranked):
1. Carlton Centre | 732 ft | Rank 1
2. Kwadukuza Egoli Hotel Tower 1, Trust Bank Building | 459 ft | Rank 2
3. Standard Bank Building | 455 ft | Rank 3
4. Schlesinger Building | 361 ft | Rank 4
5. Chamber of Mines Building | 262 ft | Rank 5

Conclusion
- The statement is incorrect on the building’s height and identity: 459 feet corresponds to the Trust Bank Building, not the Schlesinger Building.
- The Schlesinger Building is the fourth tallest among the Johannesburg entries in this dataset, but its height is 361 feet, not 459 feet.

Assumptions
- “Largest” is interpreted as “tallest by height in feet.”
- “Schiesinger” refers to the Schlesinger Building in Johannesburg.
- Verification is grounded in the provided authoritative dataset (list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa).
