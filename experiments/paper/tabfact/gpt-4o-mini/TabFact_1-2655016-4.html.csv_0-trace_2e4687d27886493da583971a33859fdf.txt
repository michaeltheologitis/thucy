Evidence collected
1) Identify episodes on December 7 and December 17
- SQL executed:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "original air date" ILIKE '%Dec%'
ORDER BY "original air date" ASC;
- Relevant results from this query:
  - December 7, 1996: season 4, series 41, episode title: "dru hill", nick prod: 341
  - December 17, 1996: season 6, series 43, episode title: "music special", nick prod: 343

2) Identify the episode titled "Ray J"
- SQL executed:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%ray j%'
ORDER BY season, series;
- Result:
  - Season 14, series 51, episode title: "ray j", original air date: February 8, 1997, nick prod: 351

Assessment
- Compare Nick production numbers:
  - December 7 episode nick prod: 341
  - December 17 episode nick prod: 343
  - "Ray J" episode nick prod: 351
- Checks:
  - 343 (Dec 17) > 341 (Dec 7): True
  - 343 (Dec 17) < 351 (Ray J): True

Conclusion
The data supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions
