Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: wyfk (columns: "call sign" text, "frequency mhz" text, "city of license" text, "erp w" bigint, "class" text, "fcc info" text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Claim: W230AV has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama
- SQL executed (exact match):
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "frequency mhz", "class", "erp w", "fcc info" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'W230AV';
  Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed (case-insensitive match):
  SELECT * FROM public.wyfk WHERE LOWER("call sign") = LOWER('W230AV');
  Result: 1 row
  • call sign: w230av
  • city of license: Gadsden, Alabama
  • frequency mhz: 93.9 fm
  • class: D
  • erp w: 10
  • fcc info: fcc
Conclusion for W230AV: The data shows city of license is Gadsden, Alabama, not Anniston, Alabama. This contradicts the claim.

2) Claim: W269X has a city of license of Griffin, Georgia
- SQL executed (exact match):
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "frequency mhz", "class", "erp w", "fcc info" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'W269X';
  Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed (case-insensitive match):
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "frequency mhz", "class", "erp w", "fcc info" FROM public.wyfk WHERE LOWER("call sign") = LOWER('W269X');
  Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed (prefix search, in case of a longer translator suffix):
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" LIKE 'W269X%';
  Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed (broader prefix search for any W269xx):
  SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" LIKE 'W269%';
  Result: 0 rows
Conclusion for W269X: No record found in the dataset; the claim cannot be supported by the available data.

Overall conclusion
- W230AV: contradicted by data (city of license is Gadsden, AL, not Anniston, AL).
- W269X: unsupported by the data (no matching record; cannot verify Griffin, GA).

Assumptions and notes
- Treated the TabFact.public.wyfk table as authoritative for call sign, frequency, and city-of-license data.
- Used case-insensitive and prefix searches because FM translator call signs typically follow the pattern W/K + channel number + two-letter suffix; the provided “W269X” may be incomplete. Even with prefix searches, no matching entry was found.
