Objective: Verify the claim that the Detroit Pistons had their lowest game attendance of the 2010–2011 season on March 20 against Atlanta at Philips Arena.

Data source discovered
- Database schema: public
- Table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence and SQL
1) Identify the March 20 game details
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE date ILIKE '%Mar%' OR date ILIKE '%March%';
- Result excerpt includes:
  game=70 | date='march 20' | team='atlanta' | location attendance='philips arena 17580'
  This confirms the March 20 game vs Atlanta at Philips Arena, with attendance 17,580.

2) Find the lowest attendance across the full 2010–2011 season and identify the game(s)
- Executed SQL to compute minimum attendance (parse last space-delimited token as integer):
  SELECT MIN(CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', array_length(string_to_array("location attendance", ' '), 1)) AS INTEGER)) AS min_attendance
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
- Returned value: 11364 (lowest attendance)

- Executed SQL to retrieve the game(s) with that minimum attendance:
  SELECT date, team, "location attendance"
  FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  WHERE CAST(split_part("location attendance", ' ', array_length(string_to_array("location attendance", ' '), 1)) AS INTEGER) = 11364;
- Result summary: date='march 1' | team='milwaukee' | location attendance='bradley center 11364'
  This shows the season’s lowest attendance occurred on March 1 vs Milwaukee at the Bradley Center, not on March 20 vs Atlanta.

Conclusion
- The March 20 game vs Atlanta at Philips Arena did occur and had an attendance of 17,580, but it was not the lowest of the season. The lowest recorded attendance in the 2010–2011 Pistons season was 11,364 on March 1 against Milwaukee at the Bradley Center. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “This period of the 2010–2011 season” is interpreted as the entire 2010–2011 season covered by the table public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season.
- Spelling variation: “Phillips” vs “Philips” Arena; data lists “philips arena,” assumed to refer to Atlanta’s arena.
