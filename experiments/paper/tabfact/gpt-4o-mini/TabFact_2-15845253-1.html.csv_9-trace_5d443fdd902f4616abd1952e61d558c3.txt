Summary
- Claim tested: "only 1 of the viral disease have not be assign to a family."
- Finding: Supported by the data in the public.viral_disease table. Exactly one row has family marked as "unassigned". There are no NULL or blank family values.

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table viral_disease.
- Table columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text). No keys/constraints.

Step 1: Inspect table structure
- Tool: Schema inspection
- Result: Confirmed columns and that family is a text column (nullable allowed), guiding how to check for missing or special values.

Step 2: Get totals and distinct family values
Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM public.viral_disease;
   Result: 23

2) SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS missing_family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE family IS NULL OR family = '';
   Result: 0

3) SQL: SELECT family, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY family;
   Result (family: count):
   - filoviridae: 1
   - bunyaviridae: 1
   - poxviridae: 1
   - flaviviridae: 1
   - arenaviridae: 1
   - papillomaviridae: 1
   - rhabdoviridae: 1
   - herpesviridae: 1
   - retroviridae: 1
   - caliciviridae: 1
   - picornaviridae: 1
   - astroviridae: 1
   - paramyxoviridae: 1
   - coronaviridae: 1
   - togaviridae: 1
   - hepadnaviridae: 1
   - orthomyxoviridae: 1
   - hepeviridae: 1
   - polyomaviridae: 1
   - adenoviridae: 1
   - reoviridae: 1
   - unassigned: 1
   - parvoviridae: 1

Interpretation: No NULL/blank family values, but there is exactly one row explicitly labeled "unassigned" in the family column.

Step 3: Verify count of unassigned and inspect the row
Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_unassigned FROM public.viral_disease WHERE LOWER(TRIM(family)) = 'unassigned';
   Result: 1

2) SQL: SELECT * FROM public.viral_disease WHERE LOWER(TRIM(family)) = 'unassigned';
   Result row:
   - Family: unassigned
   - Baltimore Group: group v
   - Envelopment: enveloped
   - Virion Shape: spherical
   - Replication Site: nucleus

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one record where the family is marked as "unassigned". Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "Not assigned to a family" is interpreted as records where family is explicitly labeled 'unassigned' (case-insensitive), in addition to checking for NULL/blank. No other sentinel values (e.g., 'unknown', 'n/a') appear in the dataset.
