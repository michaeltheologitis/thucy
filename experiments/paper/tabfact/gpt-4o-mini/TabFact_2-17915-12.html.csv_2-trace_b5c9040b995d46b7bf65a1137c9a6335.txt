Claim interpreted: “Only the Masters Series final in Paris has a carpet surface.”

Data sources discovered
- A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: lleyton_hewitt (columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score). This appears to list Lleyton Hewitt’s Masters Series finals, with the tournament (championship), year, surface, and result.

Evidence gathered
1) Full contents of the table
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM lleyton_hewitt;

Result (relevant fields summarized):
- stuttgart, 2000, hard (i), runner-up
- indian wells, 2002, hard, winner
- cincinnati, 2002, hard, runner-up
- paris, 2002, carpet (i), runner-up
- indian wells (2), 2003, hard, winner
- cincinnati (2), 2004, hard, runner-up
- indian wells, 2005, hard, runner-up

2) Filter for carpet surfaces
SQL executed:
SELECT championship, year, surface, outcome
FROM lleyton_hewitt
WHERE LOWER(surface) LIKE '%carpet%';

Result:
- championship: paris; year: 2002; surface: carpet (i); outcome: runner-up

Assessment against the claim
- Within the available data (Hewitt’s Masters Series finals), the only final recorded on carpet is Paris (2002). All other listed finals are on hard or hard (indoor). This supports the statement in the context of this dataset.
- However, the dataset covers only Lleyton Hewitt’s finals; it does not include all Masters Series finals for all players or years. Therefore, while the claim is consistent with the evidence we have, we cannot conclusively verify it as a universal statement across all Masters Series finals from this data alone.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available evidence for Lleyton Hewitt’s Masters Series finals, but broader verification across all Masters Series finals is outside the scope of the current dataset.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “only the master series final in paris have a carpet surface” as applying to the Masters Series finals represented in the lleyton_hewitt table. If the intended claim is universal (across all Masters Series finals historically), additional data would be required to fully verify it.
