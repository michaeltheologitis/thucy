Claim: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the matches on February 12 and February 20 both have the same decision.

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season containing the Minnesota Wild’s 2007–08 season data.
- Schema (from the database): columns are date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence from executed queries:
1) Quick look at sample rows to confirm date formatting and presence of February entries
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 20;
- Observation: Sample output includes entries with lowercase month names (e.g., “february 12”, “february 20”) and shows the “decision” values such as “backstrom” and “harding”.

2) Retrieve the two games in question (February 12 and February 20)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE date IN ('february 12', 'february 20');
- Result:
  • Date: february 12 | Visitor: minnesota | Home: edmonton | Score: 2 - 4 | Decision: harding
  • Date: february 20 | Visitor: minnesota | Home: chicago  | Score: 0 - 3 | Decision: harding

3) Verify that the decision values are the same across these two dates
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT decision) AS distinct_decision_count 
  FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season 
  WHERE LOWER(date) IN ('february 12', 'february 20');
- Result: 1 distinct decision value

4) Identify the specific decision value shared by both games
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season WHERE LOWER(date) IN ('february 12', 'february 20');
- Result: harding

Conclusion:
- Both the February 12 and February 20 games list the same value in the decision column: “harding”. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Decision” refers to the dataset’s decision column, which records the goaltender of record (e.g., Harding, Backstrom) for the Minnesota Wild in each game. Dates refer to those within the 2007–08 season dataset.
