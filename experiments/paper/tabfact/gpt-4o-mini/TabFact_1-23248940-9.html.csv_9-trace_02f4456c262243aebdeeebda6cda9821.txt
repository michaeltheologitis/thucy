Claim evaluated: “the bobcat have a record of more win than loss.”

Data source explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (Charlotte Bobcats, 2009–10 season, per-game rows with a cumulative record field)

Schema details (abridged)
- Columns include: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), record (text). “record” stores the cumulative W-L after each game.

Context on available data
- The table in this environment contains a subset of that season (games 47–56), not the entire year.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Dataset size and coverage
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result: 10

SQL:
SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result: min_game = 47, max_game = 56

2) Latest available record in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT record FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1;
Result: "27 - 29"

3) Extract wins and losses from the latest record and evaluate
SQL:
SELECT SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 1)::integer AS wins, SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 2)::integer AS losses FROM (SELECT record FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1) AS latest_record;
Result: wins = 27, losses = 29

SQL:
SELECT (SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 1)::integer > SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 2)::integer) AS more_wins_than_losses FROM (SELECT record FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1) AS latest_record;
Result: more_wins_than_losses = false

Conclusion
- As of the latest game present in the dataset (game 56), the Charlotte Bobcats’ cumulative record is 27–29, meaning they do not have more wins than losses. The claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions made
- “the bobcat” is interpreted as the Charlotte Bobcats because the only available data source pertains to the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season.
- “record of more win than loss” is interpreted as having a cumulative winning record at the latest point recorded in the dataset available here (games 47–56).
