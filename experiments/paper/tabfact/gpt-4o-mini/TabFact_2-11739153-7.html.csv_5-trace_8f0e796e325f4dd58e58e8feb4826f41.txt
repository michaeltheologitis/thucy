Claim to verify: "During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota lost by more than 2 on February 27 and February 29."

Data discovery and schema
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season.
- Schema (via schema inspection): columns = date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence collected
1) Retrieve all available February game rows (ordered by date) to locate February 27 and February 29 entries and inspect scores.
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY date ASC;

Key returned rows relevant to the claim (subset shown from the result):
- February 27 | Visitor: Minnesota | Home: Tampa Bay | Score: 3 - 2 | Decision: Backstrom
- February 29 | Visitor: Minnesota | Home: Florida   | Score: 3 - 2 | Decision: Backstrom

Interpretation of the score field
- The score column is expressed as "visitor_goals - home_goals." Cross-check within the same result set supports this mapping. For example:
  - February 20 | Visitor: Minnesota | Home: Chicago | Score: 0 - 3 → Minnesota (visitor) lost by 3, which aligns with the expected interpretation.

Assessment against the claim
- February 27: Minnesota (visitor) 3, Tampa Bay (home) 2 → Minnesota won by 1 goal (not a loss).
- February 29: Minnesota (visitor) 3, Florida (home) 2 → Minnesota won by 1 goal (not a loss).
- Therefore, Minnesota did not lose on either February 27 or February 29, let alone by more than 2 goals.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Minnesota won both games 3–2 on February 27 and February 29 of the 2007–08 season.

Assumptions made
- Dates in the table labeled "February 27" and "February 29" correspond to February 27, 2008 and February 29, 2008 within the 2007–08 NHL season.
- The score field is interpreted as visitor_goals - home_goals, consistent with multiple entries in the same dataset (e.g., February 20).
