Summary
- Claim interpreted as: “There are only 3 rows in the table that have the highest rank.” In the only available table (public.list_of_sumo_record_holders), the highest rank present is ōzeki, and there are 6 such rows, not 3.

Data discovery and schema confirmation
1) List available tables in the public schema
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result:
- list_of_sumo_record_holders

2) List columns for tables in the public schema
SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result for list_of_sumo_record_holders:
- total (bigint)
- name (text)
- first (text)
- last (text)
- highest rank (text)

Verification steps and evidence
3) Distinct values of “highest rank”
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "highest rank" FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
Result:
- sekiwake
- ōzeki

4) Count rows by “highest rank”
SQL:
SELECT "highest rank", COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders 
GROUP BY "highest rank" 
ORDER BY "highest rank", count DESC;
Result:
- ōzeki: 6
- sekiwake: 6

5) Explicit count of rows where “highest rank” = 'ōzeki'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE "highest rank" = 'ōzeki';
Result:
- 6

6) Rows with “highest rank” = 'ōzeki' (sample confirmation)
SQL:
SELECT name, first, last, total, "highest rank" 
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders 
WHERE "highest rank" = 'ōzeki' 
ORDER BY name;
Result (names/fields):
- daikirin | november 1966 | september 1970 | 22 | ōzeki
- kaiō | may 1994 | july 2000 | 32 | ōzeki
- kisenosato | july 2006 | september 2011 | 22 | ōzeki
- kotomitsuki | january 2001 | july 2007 | 30 | ōzeki
- musōyama | march 1994 | september 2000 | 31 | ōzeki
- tochiazuma ii | july 1997 | january 2005 | 22 | ōzeki

Conclusion
- The highest rank present in the table is ōzeki (among the values ōzeki and sekiwake). There are 6 entries with this highest rank. Therefore, the claim that there are only 3 highest-rank entries in the table is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The phrase “highest rank list” was interpreted as “rows whose ‘highest rank’ equals the top rank present in the table.” Among the present rank values, ōzeki is assumed to outrank sekiwake (standard sumo ranking order).
- The table referenced by the claim is public.list_of_sumo_record_holders, the only accessible table in the provided data source.
