Claim interpreted: Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth were all captains who won “the cup” two times.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with a table public.solheim_cup (Solheim Cup historical records).

Evidence 1: List all Solheim Cup records
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY year ASC;
- Returned rows (relevant to the three captains):
  - 1990 | United States | USA captain: Kathy Whitworth | Europe captain: Mickey Walker
  - 1992 | Europe        | USA captain: Kathy Whitworth | Europe captain: Mickey Walker
  - 1996 | United States | USA captain: Judy Rankin      | Europe captain: Mickey Walker
  - 1998 | United States | USA captain: Judy Rankin      | Europe captain: Pia Nilsson
  - 2002 | United States | USA captain: Patty Sheehan    | Europe captain: Dale Reid
  - 2003 | Europe        | USA captain: Patty Sheehan    | Europe captain: Catrin Nilsmark

Evidence 2: Confirm they were USA captains in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "usa captain" FROM public.solheim_cup;
- Result includes: Kathy Whitworth, Judy Rankin, Patty Sheehan (among others).

Analysis
- Judy Rankin: 2 wins as captain (1996, 1998) — matches “won the cup 2 times.”
- Kathy Whitworth: 1 win (1990) and 1 loss (1992) — does not match “2 times.”
- Patty Sheehan: 1 win (2002) and 1 loss (2003) — does not match “2 times.”

Conclusion
- Only Judy Rankin captained two winning USA teams according to the dataset. Kathy Whitworth and Patty Sheehan each captained one winning team. Therefore, the statement that all three won the cup two times as captains is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “the cup” refers to the Solheim Cup, as that is the available and relevant dataset.
