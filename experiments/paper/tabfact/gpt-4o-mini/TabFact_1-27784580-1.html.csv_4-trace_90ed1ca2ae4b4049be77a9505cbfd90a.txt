Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: tsuki_no_koibito (contains columns: Unnamed: 0, episode title, romanized title, translation of title, broadcast date, ratings)

Schema check (to understand fields and data types)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'tsuki_no_koibito';
- Result (relevant parts): romanized title (text), episode title (text), ratings (text)

Evidence 1: Rating of “suki to ietara iinoni”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "romanized title", ratings FROM tsuki_no_koibito WHERE "romanized title" = 'suki to ietara iinoni';
- Result: romanized title = suki to ietara iinoni, ratings = 17.4%

Evidence 2: Lowest rating in the table (proper numeric ordering)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "romanized title", ratings FROM tsuki_no_koibito ORDER BY CAST(REPLACE(ratings, '%','') AS NUMERIC) ASC LIMIT 1;
- Result: romanized title = saishūshōjomakuwakare, ratings = 13.4%

Evidence 3: Numeric difference in percentage points between the two
- Executed SQL (to compute values used):
  1) SELECT CAST(REPLACE(ratings, '%', '') AS numeric) AS numeric_rating FROM tsuki_no_koibito WHERE "episode title" = '好きと言えたらいいのに';
  2) SELECT MIN(CAST(REPLACE(ratings, '%', '') AS numeric)) AS lowest_rating FROM tsuki_no_koibito;
- Results used: 17.4 (suki to ietara iinoni) and 13.4 (lowest)
- Difference: 17.4 - 13.4 = 4.0 percentage points

Conclusion
- The rating of “suki to ietara iinoni” is 17.4%, and the lowest rating in the table is 13.4%. The difference is exactly 4.0 percentage points. This supports the claim that it has a 4% higher rating than the lowest-rated title (interpreting “4% higher” as percentage-point difference).

Assumptions
- “4% higher” is interpreted as a 4 percentage-point difference (e.g., 17.4% vs. 13.4%), not a 4% relative increase over the lowest rating.
- Ratings are stored as text with a trailing '%' and were converted to numeric for correct comparisons.
