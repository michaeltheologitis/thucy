Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. There is exactly one row where eeprom < 128, and in that row the package is recorded as "pdip - 20".

Evidence and executed SQL:
- Listing rows with eeprom < 128
  - Result:
    - chip: at90s1200; eeprom: 64; package: pdip - 20
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT chip, eeprom, package FROM public.my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128;

- Counting rows with eeprom < 128
  - Result: 1
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE eeprom < 128;

- Counting rows with eeprom < 128 where package normalizes to pdip-20 (case-insensitive, ignoring spaces and hyphen)
  - Result: 1
  - SQL executed:
    SELECT COUNT(*) 
    FROM my_info_table 
    WHERE eeprom < 128 AND 
    LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE(package, ' ', ''), '-', '')) = 'pdip20'

Taken together, these queries show there is exactly one occurrence ("on 1 occasion") where eeprom is less than 128, and for that occurrence the package value is recorded as "pdip - 20".

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "on 1 occasion" to mean exactly one row in the available dataset satisfies the condition.
- Treated "pdip - 20" as equivalent to "pdip-20" regardless of spacing and case, matching the dataset’s package formatting.
