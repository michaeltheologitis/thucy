Summary
The claim is that “Macoto Cobra [Cobras] be the opponent of Diegomar Markwell.” Using the available TabFact database (public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season) for the Uni-President Lions’ 2007 season, I verified whether Macoto Cobras appear as an opponent and whether Diegomar Markwell is recorded in a game versus that opponent.

Evidence Collected
1) Distinct opponents in the 2007 Uni-President Lions season
- Result: The table lists “macoto cobras” among the distinct opponents.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season;
- Output (as returned):
1. la new bears
2. brother elephants
3. macoto cobras
4. chinatrust whales

2) Case-insensitive search for games where ‘markwell’ appears (loss or save)
- Result: A game is recorded where the opponent is Macoto Cobras and the losing pitcher is “diegomar markwell.”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save 
FROM t_2007_uni_president_lions_season 
WHERE LOWER(loss) LIKE '%markwell%' OR LOWER(save) LIKE '%markwell%';
- Output (as returned):
Date: 3 / 31; Opponent: Macoto Cobras; Score: 11 - 5; Loss: diegomar markwell; Save: ||2275

3) Case-insensitive filter specifically for Macoto Cobras
- Result: Confirms at least one game vs Macoto Cobras; the same row shows “diegomar markwell” as the losing pitcher.
- Executed SQL (count and sample rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE 'macoto cobras';
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent ILIKE 'macoto cobras' LIMIT 5;
- Output (as returned):
Count: 1
Row: Date: 3 / 31; Opponent: Macoto Cobras; Score: 11 - 5; Loss: diegomar markwell; Save: ||2275

Conclusion
The data shows that the Uni-President Lions played against the Macoto Cobras and that Diegomar Markwell is recorded as the losing pitcher in a game versus Macoto Cobras. This directly supports the claim that Macoto Cobras were the opponent of Diegomar Markwell.

Assumptions
- “macoto cobra” is interpreted as the CPBL team “Macoto Cobras.”
- The table public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season reflects official 2007 game logs for the Uni-President Lions, where the “loss” column records the losing pitcher for the Lions. Thus, “diegomar markwell” indicates his participation for the Lions in that game.
