Claim to verify: Episode number 67 titled "The Lorelais' First Day at Yale" has 1.6 million fewer viewers than episode 69 titled "Chicken or Beef?".

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Evidence SQL: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';
- Result excerpt: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes exists.

Step 2: Inspect table schema
- Evidence SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes' AND table_schema = 'public';
- Relevant columns found:
  - no (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - us viewers (million) (double precision)
  - (plus other metadata columns)

Step 3: Preview data (context)
- Evidence SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes LIMIT 15;
- Result excerpt shows:
  - no=67, title="the lorelais' first day at yale", us viewers (million)=3.9
  - no=69, title="chicken or beef", us viewers (million)=5.5

Step 4: Retrieve exact episodes and viewer counts
- Evidence SQL (Episode 67): SELECT title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no = 67;
  - Result: title = the lorelais' first day at yale; us viewers (million) = 3.9
- Evidence SQL (Episode 69): SELECT title, "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no = 69;
  - Result: title = chicken or beef; us viewers (million) = 5.5

Step 5: Compute the difference
- Evidence SQL: SELECT (SELECT "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no = 69) - (SELECT "us viewers (million)" FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no = 67) AS diff_millions;
  - Result: diff_millions = 1.6

Conclusion
- Episode 67 had 3.9 million viewers; Episode 69 had 5.5 million viewers. The difference (Episode 69 minus Episode 67) is 1.6 million. Therefore, Episode 67 had 1.6 million fewer viewers than Episode 69, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- "number 67" and "episode 69" refer to the overall episode numbers stored in the column no.
- "viewers" refers to the column us viewers (million), representing U.S. viewership in millions.
