Claim to verify: “Of the 3 different positions, Georgia and Penn State contribute a center and a guard.”

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify Utah Jazz players whose school/club team is Georgia or Penn State
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team"
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%'

Result rows:
- Player: John Amaechi | Position: Center / Forward | School/Club Team: Penn State
- Player: Shandon Anderson | Position: Guard / Forward | School/Club Team: Georgia

2) Determine the distinct positions represented by those rows
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(position, '/'))) AS trimmed_position
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%';

Result distinct positions:
- Guard
- Forward
- Center

Executed SQL (count of distinct positions among those rows):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT trimmed_position) AS distinct_position_count
FROM (
    SELECT TRIM(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(position, '/'))) AS trimmed_position
    FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
    WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%'
) AS subquery;

Result: 3 distinct positions

Assessment
- Among the players from Georgia and Penn State, the combined positions represented are Guard, Forward, and Center (three distinct positions). Specifically:
  - Georgia (Shandon Anderson) contributes a Guard (also listed as Guard/Forward).
  - Penn State (John Amaechi) contributes a Center (also listed as Center/Forward).
- Therefore, within the three distinct positions represented by these schools, Georgia and Penn State do contribute a guard and a center, which supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- “Position” refers to the position column in the Utah Jazz all-time roster table.
- “Georgia” and “Penn State” refer to the values in the “school / club team” field and are matched via case-insensitive substring to capture exact listings present in the data.
- The phrase “of the 3 different position” is interpreted as referring to the three distinct positions collectively represented by the players from Georgia and Penn State (Guard, Forward, Center).
