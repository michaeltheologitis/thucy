Summary of the claim
- Claim: “the game between team 1 saint - louis fc and team 2 eleven arrow fc have the highest combined agg compare to any featured game.”
- Interpretation: Within the accessible dataset of matches (treated as the “featured games”), the match between Saint - Louis FC and Eleven Arrow(s) FC has the highest combined aggregate score (sum of both teams’ aggregate goals in the ‘agg’ column) compared to any other game.

Data sources discovered
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
- Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)
- Note: There is no explicit “featured game” flag; all rows are treated as featured games for this verification.

Evidence collected
1) Locate any rows containing Saint - Louis and any containing Eleven Arrow(s)
- Purpose: Verify whether the two teams exist and whether they played each other.
- Result highlights:
  - Saint - Louis FC appears vs Young Africans with agg 2 - 7.
  - Eleven Arrows FC appears vs Arsenal (Maseru) with agg 4 - 0.
  - No row where Saint - Louis FC plays Eleven Arrow(s) FC.
- Executed SQL:
  -- Find matches with ‘saint’, ‘st’, or ‘louis’
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%saint%' OR LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%st%' OR LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%louis%') OR (LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%saint%' OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%st%' OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%louis%');
  
  -- Find matches with ‘eleven’ or ‘arrow’
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE (LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%eleven%' OR LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%arrow%') OR (LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%eleven%' OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%arrow%');

2) Determine the highest combined aggregate across all games
- Method: Parse only the first two integers at the start of the agg field using regex ^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+) and compute combined_agg = first_int + second_int. This avoids counting any parenthetical details (e.g., penalty shootouts) beyond the main two numbers.
- Result: Maximum combined_agg = 9, achieved by:
  - Team 1: saint - louis fc; Team 2: young africans; Agg: 2 - 7; Combined_agg: 9
- Executed SQL:
  -- Compute the maximum combined_agg
  WITH parsed AS (
      SELECT
          "team 1",
          "team 2",
          agg,
          (regexp_matches(agg, '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'))[1]::int AS first_int,
          (regexp_matches(agg, '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'))[2]::int AS second_int
      FROM
          t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
      WHERE
          agg ~ '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'
  ), combined AS (
      SELECT
          "team 1",
          "team 2",
          agg,
          first_int + second_int AS combined_agg
      FROM
          parsed
  )
  SELECT
      MAX(combined_agg) AS max_combined_agg
  FROM
      combined;

  -- Retrieve all rows with the maximum combined_agg
  WITH parsed AS (
      SELECT
          "team 1",
          "team 2",
          agg,
          (regexp_matches(agg, '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'))[1]::int AS first_int,
          (regexp_matches(agg, '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'))[2]::int AS second_int
      FROM
          t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
      WHERE
          agg ~ '^\s*([0-9]+)\D+([0-9]+)'
  ), combined AS (
      SELECT
          "team 1",
          "team 2",
          agg,
          first_int + second_int AS combined_agg
      FROM
          parsed
  )
  SELECT
      "team 1",
      "team 2",
      agg,
      combined_agg
  FROM
      combined
  WHERE
      combined_agg = (SELECT MAX(combined_agg) FROM combined);

Assessment against the claim
- The specific pairing “Saint - Louis FC” vs “Eleven Arrow(s) FC” does not appear in the dataset, so that game did not occur in this table of featured games.
- The highest combined aggregate is 9, and it belongs to Saint - Louis FC vs Young Africans (2 - 7), not against Eleven Arrow(s) FC.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The game between team 1 Saint - Louis FC and team 2 Eleven Arrow(s) FC does not have the highest combined aggregate; in fact, that pairing is not present in the dataset. The highest combined aggregate found is 9 for Saint - Louis FC vs Young Africans.

Assumptions made
- All rows in public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs are treated as the “featured games” since no explicit featured flag exists.
- “Combined agg” is interpreted as the sum of the first two integers in the ‘agg’ field, ignoring any subsequent parenthetical notes (e.g., penalty details). 
- Variations in hyphen characters and spacing in agg are normalized via regex, and name matching is case-insensitive, acknowledging possible pluralization differences (Eleven Arrow vs Eleven Arrows).
