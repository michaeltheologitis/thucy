Objective
Determine whether there is any tournament in the available dataset where the opponent is Roger Federer and the match was played on a carpet surface, and identify such tournaments if they exist.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: ji_nov_k with columns
  - date (text)
  - tournament (text)
  - surface (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)

Executed queries and evidence
1) Check for tournaments vs Roger Federer on Carpet
SQL:
SELECT tournament, COUNT(*) AS match_count 
FROM ji_nov_k 
WHERE opponent = 'Roger Federer' 
AND surface = 'Carpet' 
GROUP BY tournament;
Result: No rows returned. Interpretation: No exact matches for surface value 'Carpet' with opponent exactly 'Roger Federer'.

2) Case-insensitive scan of all rows vs Federer to see surfaces present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%federer%';
Result: clay

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE opponent ILIKE '%federer%';
Result: roger federer
Interpretation: All matches in the dataset against Federer are on clay; opponent recorded as "roger federer" in lowercase.

3) List tournaments vs Federer by surface
SQL:
SELECT tournament, surface, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%federer%'
GROUP BY tournament, surface;
Result:
- Tournament: Gstaad, Switzerland | Surface: Clay | Match Count: 1
Interpretation: The only Federer-opponent entry is a clay match at Gstaad, Switzerland.

4) Verify whether any carpet entries exist at all, and whether any intersect with Federer
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT surface FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE surface ILIKE '%carpet%';
Result: carpet (i)

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.ji_nov_k WHERE surface ILIKE '%carpet%';
Result: 1

SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, opponent, surface, score
FROM public.ji_nov_k
WHERE surface ILIKE '%carpet%' AND opponent ILIKE '%federer%';
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: There is one carpet-surface entry in the dataset ("carpet (i)"), but none of the carpet matches are against Roger Federer.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no tournaments where the opponent is Roger Federer and the surface includes carpet. The only recorded Federer-opponent match is on clay (Gstaad, Switzerland).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the request as a verification of existence within the provided dataset only.
- Treated "carpet surface" as any surface value containing the substring "carpet" (case-insensitive), including variants like "carpet (i)".
- Used case-insensitive matching for the opponent name to capture potential casing variations (e.g., "roger federer").
