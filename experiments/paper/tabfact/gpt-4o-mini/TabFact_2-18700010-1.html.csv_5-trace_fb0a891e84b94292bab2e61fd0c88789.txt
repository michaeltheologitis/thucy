Claim interpreted: “Dave Sutton has the least (fewest) league goals among DF (defender) position players.” Data source: t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (Huddersfield Town 1979–80 season).

Evidence 1: Dave Sutton’s record
- Result: Name: Dave Sutton; Position: Defender (df); League Goals: 6
- SQL Query Executed:
  SELECT name, position, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE '%Dave Sutton%';

Evidence 2: All defenders’ league goals (ascending)
- Results:
  1) Bernard Purdie — League Goals: 0
  2) Jim Branagan — League Goals: 0
  3) Chris Topping — League Goals: 0
  4) Fred Robinson — League Goals: 1
  5) Malcolm Brown — League Goals: 2
  6) Keith Hanvey — League Goals: 2
  7) Dave Sutton — League Goals: 6
- SQL Query Executed:
  SELECT name, "league goals"
  FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
  WHERE LOWER(position) LIKE '%df%'
  ORDER BY "league goals" ASC;

Conclusion
- The data show Dave Sutton scored 6 league goals and that multiple defenders scored fewer (0, 1, or 2). He does not have the least league goals among defenders; he actually has the most in this position group for the dataset.

Assumptions
- “df position” refers to players whose position text contains “df” (defender) in the provided table.
- The claim pertains specifically to the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season represented in the available dataset.
