Claim: “Olga Govortsova advanced to the third round in the French Open two years in a row.”

Evidence from the database (public.olga_govortsova):
- Retrieved the specific row for the French Open and examined results for 2007–2011.
- Results for French Open:
  - 2007: a (absent)
  - 2008: 3r (Third Round)
  - 2009: 3r (Third Round)
  - 2010: 2r (Second Round)
  - 2011: 2r (Second Round)
- These data show she reached the third round in consecutive years 2008 and 2009.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) To directly fetch the French Open row
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE LOWER(tournament) = 'french open' AND ("2007" IS NOT NULL OR "2008" IS NOT NULL OR "2009" IS NOT NULL OR "2010" IS NOT NULL OR "2011" IS NOT NULL);

2) Context query listing tournaments and their yearly codes
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM public.olga_govortsova;

Conclusion: The database shows Olga Govortsova reached the French Open third round in 2008 and 2009, i.e., two consecutive years, which supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Result codes follow standard tennis notation (e.g., 3r = Third Round, 2r = Second Round, a = Absent/Did not participate).
- The “French Open” row corresponds to Roland Garros (women’s singles results).
