Claim to verify: “the packer score the highest amount of point (6) in a game versus the lion.”

Data scope used: The available authoritative dataset is a single table for the Detroit Lions’ 1976 season: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance).

Evidence from data
1) Enumerate all games and identify opponents (confirms Green Bay Packers are in the table)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Key result values include: Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins, Los Angeles Rams, New Orleans Saints, Minnesota Vikings, Buffalo Bills, Atlanta Falcons, New York Giants, New England Patriots, Seattle Seahawks, Chicago Bears.

2) Retrieve all games to see scores for games vs Packers
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week ASC;
Relevant returned rows:
- Week 4 | Date: October 3, 1976 | Opponent: Green Bay Packers | Result: L 24 - 14 | Attendance: 55041
- Week 8 | Date: October 31, 1976 | Opponent: Green Bay Packers | Result: W 27 - 6 | Attendance: 74992

Interpretation of results formatting: For losses, the “Result” shows the opponent’s points first (e.g., L 24 - 14 means opponent 24, Lions 14). For wins, it shows Lions first (e.g., W 27 - 6 means Lions 27, opponent 6).

Findings
- In Week 4, the Packers scored 24 points (Lions 14).
- In Week 8, the Packers scored 6 points (Lions 27).
- Therefore, against the Lions in 1976, the Packers’ higher scoring output was 24 points, not 6.

Conclusion
The claim that “the packer score the highest amount of point (6) in a game versus the lion” is contradicted by the data in the 1976 season dataset. The highest points the Packers scored versus the Lions in 1976 was 24, not 6.

Assumptions
- “the packer” refers to the Green Bay Packers (NFL) and “the lion” refers to the Detroit Lions (NFL).
- Verification is constrained to the available 1976 Detroit Lions season data, which is the only accessible authoritative source provided here.
