Claim to verify: “Equestrian at the Asian Games has been located in a different city every year it occurred except 1994 and 1998.”

Data source discovery:
- Available table: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games with columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze.

Evidence from data:
1) Full list of editions and locations
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (year → location):
  1982 → New Delhi
  1986 → Seoul
  1994 → Hiroshima
  1998 → Bangkok
  2002 → Busan
  2006 → Doha
  2010 → Guangzhou

2) Check whether locations repeat across editions
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_editions FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
- Result: 7
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT location) AS distinct_locations FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
- Result: 7
- Interpretation: Each listed edition has a unique location; no location repeats.

3) Specifically check the years 1994 and 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year IN (1994, 1998);
- Result:
  1994 → Hiroshima
  1998 → Bangkok
- Interpretation: 1994 and 1998 are different cities from each other.

Assessment against the claim:
- The data shows that every edition listed took place in a different city and that 1994 and 1998 are different from each other as well. There are no exceptions in the provided data where two editions share the same city. Therefore, the statement that there is an exception for 1994 and 1998 is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data in this authoritative dataset.

Assumptions and scope:
- “Every year that it occur” is interpreted as “every Asian Games edition in which equestrian was contested.”
- “Located in a different city” is interpreted as referring to the host city listed for equestrian in each edition. The dataset covers editions 1982 through 2010; conclusions are based on this scope, which the instructions specify as authoritative for verification.
