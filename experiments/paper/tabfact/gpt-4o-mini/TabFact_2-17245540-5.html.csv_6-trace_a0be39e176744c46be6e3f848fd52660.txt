Summary of approach
- I explored the available data sources, identified the relevant table, inspected its schema, and queried for Arnold Palmer’s recorded place. I then directly tested whether his place equals “t3”. All steps and the exact SQL executed are shown below.

Data source discovery
- SQL executed: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
- Result (excerpt): includes public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf

Table schema inspection
- SQL executed: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1973_u_s_open_golf';
- Result columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence: Arnold Palmer’s recorded place in this dataset
- SQL executed: SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Palmer%';
- Result: place = t6; player = arnold palmer; score = 71 + 71 = 142; to par = e

Direct verification of the claim “place be t3”
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'arnold palmer' AND place ILIKE 't3';
- Result: 0
- SQL executed: SELECT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'arnold palmer';
- Result: t6

Conclusion
- In the available authoritative dataset (public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf), Arnold Palmer’s place is recorded as t6, not t3. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity
- The only accessible dataset pertains to the 1973 U.S. Open golf tournament. I interpreted the claim as referring to Arnold Palmer’s place within this dataset. The score formatting (e.g., “71 + 71 = 142”) suggests this table may represent a multi-round cumulative standing at a particular stage (likely mid-tournament), but it is treated as authoritative for what it records.
