Analysis:
- The dataset records a two-leg tie between Secteur 6 and Enugu Rangers with an aggregate score of 1–2. This means Secteur 6 lost the tie by 1 goal on aggregate.
- The second leg result is 0–1, indicating Secteur 6 also lost that match by 1 goal. The first leg was a 1–1 draw.
- Therefore, the statement that Secteur 6 “lose by 1” against Enugu Rangers is supported, both in the sense of the overall tie (lost by 1 on aggregate) and the second-leg match (lost by 1 goal).

Assumptions:
- “Enugu Ranger” refers to Enugu Rangers (Nigeria). Spelling/pluralization variation is treated as equivalent.
- “Lose by 1” is interpreted as either losing the tie by one goal on aggregate or losing a single leg by one goal; both are true per the data.
