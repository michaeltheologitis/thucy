Claim interpreted: “Bell Media own 3 separate radio station like the CBC.”

Scope of verification: Based on the available dataset (media_in_kelowna), which lists radio/media stations in the Kelowna market with columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner.

Data source structure checked
- Table: media_in_kelowna (frequency text, call sign text, branding text, format text, owner text)

Evidence
1) Count stations by owner
Executed SQL:
SELECT owner, COUNT(*) AS station_count 
FROM media_in_kelowna 
GROUP BY owner;

Result (relevant rows):
- Canadian Broadcasting Corporation: 3
- Bell Media: 2

2) List station details for Bell Media and CBC-related owners
Executed SQL:
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner 
FROM media_in_kelowna 
WHERE owner ILIKE '%bell%' OR owner ILIKE '%canadian broadcasting%' OR owner ILIKE '%cbc%' OR owner ILIKE '%radio-canada%' 
ORDER BY owner, frequency;

Result rows:
- Bell Media (2 stations):
  • 101.5 FM | CILK-FM | 101.5 EZ Rock | Adult Contemporary | Bell Media
  • 99.9 FM  | CHSU-FM | 99.9 Sun FM   | Contemporary Hits Radio | Bell Media
- Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (3 stations):
  • 88.9 FM | CBTK-FM     | CBC Radio One     | Public News/Talk | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
  • 89.7 FM | CBU-FM-3    | CBC Radio 2       | Public Music     | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation
  • 90.5 FM | CBUF-FM-2   | Première Chaîne   | Public News/Talk | Canadian Broadcasting Corporation

Assessment
- In the Kelowna market (per the dataset), CBC owns 3 stations, whereas Bell Media owns 2. Therefore, the specific claim that “Bell Media own 3 separate radio station like the CBC” is not supported by the data in this market.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate relative to the available data.

Assumptions
- “Like the CBC” is interpreted as “also owning three separate radio stations in the same market.”
- “CBC” refers to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation and variants (e.g., Radio-Canada).
- Verification is constrained to the available Kelowna dataset; no inference is made about other markets beyond the provided data.
