Summary of findings:
- The available data source contains one table for the 2004–05 Primeira Liga (public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga) with columns: club, head coach, city, stadium, and 2003 - 2004 season.
- We validated how many clubs in that season are listed with city = 'lisbon' and which clubs they are.

Evidence 1: Distinct cities and counts
- Result excerpt shows 'lisbon' has exactly 3 clubs in this dataset.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT city, COUNT(club) AS club_count FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga GROUP BY city ORDER BY city;

Returned (relevant rows):
- lisbon | 3

Evidence 2: Clubs whose city is 'lisbon'
- Executed SQL:
SELECT club FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE city = 'lisbon';

Returned clubs:
1) Belenenses
2) Benfica
3) Sporting CP

Conclusion:
- In the 2004–05 Primeira Liga table, exactly three clubs are listed with city = 'lisbon': Belenenses, Benfica, and Sporting CP. There are not four clubs with city = 'lisbon' in this dataset. Therefore, while the three named clubs are correctly identified as Lisbon clubs, the statement that they are “3 of 4” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- Interpreted the claim to be about the clubs listed with city = 'lisbon' in the 2004–05 Primeira Liga dataset available to us, rather than all historical seasons or broader Portuguese football contexts.
