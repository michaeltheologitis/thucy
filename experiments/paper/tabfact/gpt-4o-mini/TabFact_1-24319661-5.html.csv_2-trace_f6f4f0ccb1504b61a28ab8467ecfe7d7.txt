Summary of verification
- Data source discovery: Identified a PostgreSQL database containing the table public.list_of_white_collar_episodes, which includes episode metadata for the TV series White Collar, including a production code field.

Key evidence
1) Query: Find the episode with production code 'BCW410' (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "production code", "original air date"
FROM list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE LOWER("production code") = LOWER('BCW410');

Result:
- No in Series: 56
- No in Season: 10
- Title: Vested Interest
- Production Code: bcw410
- Original Air Date: September 18, 2012

Conclusion
- The database shows that production code bcw410 corresponds to an episode with no in season = 10. This supports the claim that bcw410 is the production code for episode 10.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the series represented in the available data source (White Collar) and interprets “episode 10” as the episode numbered 10 within its season (no in season = 10).
