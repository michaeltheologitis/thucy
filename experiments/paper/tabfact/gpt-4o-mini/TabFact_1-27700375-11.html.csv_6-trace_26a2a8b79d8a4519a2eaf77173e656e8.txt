Summary
- Scope: The available authoritative data covers the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season. Travis Outlaw was on this team that season. I verified whether he led the Nets in both points and rebounds in the same game, and how many times that occurred.

Data source discovery
- Available table: public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Find games where Travis Outlaw led in both points and rebounds
SQL:
SELECT game, date, score, "high points", "high rebounds" 
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%outlaw%' 
AND "high rebounds" ILIKE '%outlaw%';

Result: 0 rows

2) Count such games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%outlaw%' 
AND "high rebounds" ILIKE '%outlaw%';

Result: 0

Conclusion
- In the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets season data, Travis Outlaw did not lead the team in both points and rebounds in the same game at any time (count = 0). This contradicts the claim of “3 different times.”

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted within the scope of the available authoritative dataset (2010–11 New Jersey Nets). I did not have data for other teams or seasons; therefore, conclusions apply to this season/team only.
