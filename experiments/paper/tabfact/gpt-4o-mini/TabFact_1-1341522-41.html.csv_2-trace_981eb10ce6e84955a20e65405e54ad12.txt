Claim interpreted: The user asks whether William F. Goodling was “one of six Republican incumbents to be re‑elected.” Given our available 1994 U.S. House election data, I interpret this as referring to the 1994 Pennsylvania U.S. House elections.

Findings from the 1994 dataset
1) William F. Goodling’s 1994 result
- Evidence: William F. Goodling is listed in district pennsylvania19, party republican, status “re - elected.”
  - SQL: SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE incumbent = 'William F. Goodling' OR district = 'pennsylvania19';
  - Result excerpt:
    - District: pennsylvania19
    - Incumbent: william f goodling
    - Party: republican
    - First Elected: 1974
    - Status: re - elected
    - Opponent: william f goodling (r) unopposed

2) How many Pennsylvania Republican incumbents were re-elected in 1994?
- Count and list of re-elected Republican incumbents in Pennsylvania:
  - SQL (count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE district ILIKE 'pennsylvania%' AND party = 'republican' AND status ILIKE '%re - elected%';
  - SQL (list): SELECT district, incumbent FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE district ILIKE 'pennsylvania%' AND party = 'republican' AND status ILIKE '%re - elected%' ORDER BY district;
  - Results:
    - Count: 5
    - List: pennsylvania5 (william f clinger , jr), pennsylvania7 (curt weldon), pennsylvania9 (bud shuster), pennsylvania17 (george gekas), pennsylvania19 (william f goodling).

3) All Pennsylvania Republican incumbents and their 1994 outcomes (to verify the full set of GOP incumbents)
- SQL: SELECT district, incumbent, status FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE district ILIKE 'pennsylvania%' AND party = 'republican' ORDER BY district;
- Results:
  - pennsylvania5 — william f clinger , jr — re - elected
  - pennsylvania7 — curt weldon — re - elected
  - pennsylvania9 — bud shuster — re - elected
  - pennsylvania17 — george gekas — re - elected
  - pennsylvania18 — rick santorum — retired to run for us senate democratic gain
  - pennsylvania19 — william f goodling — re - elected
- Interpretation: There were six Pennsylvania Republican incumbents total in 1994; five were re-elected and one (Rick Santorum) retired to run for the U.S. Senate. Thus, Goodling was one of five Republican incumbents re-elected, not one of six.

4) (Supplemental) Pennsylvania Republican incumbents re-elected unopposed in 1994
- SQL: SELECT district, incumbent FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE party = 'republican' AND district ILIKE 'pennsylvania%' AND status ILIKE '%re - elected%' AND opponent ILIKE '%unopposed%';
- Results:
  - pennsylvania5 — William F. Clinger, Jr.
  - pennsylvania9 — Bud Shuster
  - pennsylvania17 — George Gekas
  - pennsylvania19 — William F. Goodling
- Interpretation: Four Pennsylvania Republican incumbents (including Goodling) were re-elected unopposed; this still does not support “six.”

Conclusion
- The data confirms Goodling was re-elected in 1994.
- However, the statement that he was “one of six Republican incumbents to be re-elected” is not supported by the 1994 Pennsylvania data. There were five Republican incumbents re-elected in Pennsylvania that year; the sixth Republican incumbent retired.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to the 1994 U.S. House elections in Pennsylvania because the available authoritative dataset covers that election year and encodes Pennsylvania districts explicitly. If the claim was intended to refer to a different year or a different geography, results could differ, but no other datasets were available for verification here.
