Conclusion
- The data shows that in 1986, the track "Under the Influence" has US Dance = 6 and US R&B = 9. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim was taken to mean “there exists an entry in 1986 where US Dance is 6 and US R&B is 9,” rather than a universal statement about all entries in 1986.
