Claim assessed: "all of the call sign for each translator include 3 digit number that begin with the number 2"

Data source overview
- Explored the available PostgreSQL database and identified one table: public.whlp, with a column named "call sign" (text), among others.

Evidence collected
1) List of all call signs
SQL:
SELECT "call sign" FROM public.whlp;
Result:
- w221by
- w264bf
- w240bj
- w276bm
- w293al
- w223au

2) Pattern check: Do all call signs consist of a letter, followed by a 3-digit number beginning with 2, followed by two letters?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM public.whlp;

SELECT COUNT(*) AS matching_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ~ '^[A-Za-z][2][0-9]{2}[A-Za-z]{2}$';

SELECT "call sign" FROM public.whlp WHERE NOT ("call sign" ~ '^[A-Za-z][2][0-9]{2}[A-Za-z]{2}$');
Results:
- total_count = 6
- matching_count = 6
- non-matching call signs: none

3) Extract the 3-digit portion and verify it begins with 2 for each call sign
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", SUBSTRING("call sign" FROM '([0-9]{3})') AS three_digit,
       CASE WHEN SUBSTRING("call sign" FROM '([0-9]{3})') LIKE '2%' THEN 'Yes' ELSE 'No' END AS begins_with_2
FROM public.whlp;
Results:
- w221by -> 221 -> Yes
- w264bf -> 264 -> Yes
- w240bj -> 240 -> Yes
- w276bm -> 276 -> Yes
- w293al -> 293 -> Yes
- w223au -> 223 -> Yes

Conclusion
- All call signs present in public.whlp include a three-digit numeric portion, and in each case the three-digit number begins with 2. The evidence supports the claim for the dataset examined.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “each translator” as every row in public.whlp (given the call sign formats consistent with FM translator call signs). If the claim intended a broader universe beyond this dataset, the conclusion strictly applies to the records available here.
