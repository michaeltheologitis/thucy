Claim interpreted: “James Donaldson had 2 stints on the Jazz’s roster.” I interpret “Jazz” as the Utah Jazz (NBA) and “stints” as distinct tenure segments indicated in the roster’s “years for jazz” field.

Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema containing a single table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (all-time roster of the Utah Jazz).
- Table schema (from schema inspection): columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text). No keys/constraints.

Evidence from data
1) Locate James Donaldson in the Utah Jazz all-time roster
- SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('James Donaldson');
- Result excerpt: player: James Donaldson | position: Center | years for jazz: 1993, 1994 - 95

2) Confirm via partial match and retrieve the same fields
- SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz"
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE player ILIKE '%Donaldson%';
- Result excerpt: player: James Donaldson | position: Center | years for jazz: 1993, 1994 - 95

3) Quantify the number of tenure segments (interpreting comma-separated segments as stints)
- SQL:
  SELECT player, "years for jazz", array_length(string_to_array("years for jazz", ','), 1) AS segment_count
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE player ILIKE '%Donaldson%';
- Result excerpt: player: james donaldson | years for jazz: 1993 , 1994 - 95 | segment_count: 2

Conclusion
- The “years for jazz” field for James Donaldson contains two comma-separated segments (1993 and 1994–95), indicating two distinct stints with the Utah Jazz. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Jazz” refers to the Utah Jazz of the NBA.
- “Stint” is interpreted as each comma-separated tenure segment in the “years for jazz” field, where a single season or a continuous range counts as one stint.
