Claim to verify: “collingwood score more point than hawthorn in the 1962 vfl match.”

Interpretation: I interpret this as asking whether, in a head-to-head 1962 VFL match between Collingwood and Hawthorn, Collingwood scored more total points than Hawthorn.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing a table: public.t_1962_vfl_season
- Table columns (from schema inspection):
  - home team (text)
  - home team score (text)
  - away team (text)
  - away team score (text)
  - venue (text)
  - crowd (bigint)
  - date (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct teams present in the dataset
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT "away team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
- Result (abridged): Essendon; Melbourne; Fitzroy; Footscray; Richmond; North Melbourne; Hawthorn; Collingwood; Carlton; St Kilda; Geelong; South Melbourne
- Relevance: Confirms both Collingwood and Hawthorn appear in the 1962 dataset.

2) Full table preview (to understand dataset scope)
- SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season 
LIMIT 1000;
- Result (first rows shown by the tool, all on 23 June 1962):
  • Melbourne 11.18 (84) def St Kilda 11.6 (72) at MCG
  • Essendon 15.17 (107) def Geelong 10.7 (67) at Windy Hill
  • Collingwood 10.14 (74) def Fitzroy 9.11 (65) at Victoria Park
  • Carlton 12.9 (81) def Footscray 9.10 (64) at Princes Park
  • South Melbourne 10.13 (73) lost to Richmond 11.13 (79) at Lake Oval
  • North Melbourne 10.8 (68) def Hawthorn 10.7 (67) at Arden Street Oval
- Relevance: The dataset appears to cover (at least) the round played on 23 June 1962. It does not show a Collingwood vs Hawthorn matchup in that round.

3) Direct search for Collingwood vs Hawthorn head-to-head (exact team names)
- SQL:
SELECT date, venue, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" 
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season 
WHERE ("home team" = 'Collingwood' AND "away team" = 'Hawthorn')
   OR ("home team" = 'Hawthorn' AND "away team" = 'Collingwood');
- Result: 0 rows returned (no head-to-head match recorded in the dataset).

4) Fuzzy search to allow for name variations (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season 
WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%collingwood%' OR LOWER("home team") LIKE '%hawthorn%'
   OR LOWER("away team") LIKE '%collingwood%' OR LOWER("away team") LIKE '%hawthorn%';
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  • 23 June 1962 — Collingwood 10.14 (74) vs Fitzroy 9.11 (65) at Victoria Park
  • 23 June 1962 — North Melbourne 10.8 (68) vs Hawthorn 10.7 (67) at Arden Street Oval
- Relevance: Confirms the dataset entries mentioning Collingwood and Hawthorn are vs other opponents on that date; still no Collingwood vs Hawthorn match present.

Analysis
- The available 1962 VFL dataset (as exposed) does not contain any match where Collingwood played Hawthorn head-to-head. Therefore, there is no recorded match result in this dataset from which to conclude that Collingwood scored more points than Hawthorn in a head-to-head 1962 fixture.
- The data does show that on 23 June 1962 (same round, separate matches), Collingwood scored 74 points while Hawthorn scored 67 points in their respective games against different opponents. If the claim instead intended a cross-game comparison on that date, then 74 > 67 is supported. However, the natural reading of “in the 1962 VFL match” implies a head-to-head meeting, which is not present in the dataset provided.

Conclusion
- Based strictly on the available data, there is no evidence of a 1962 head-to-head match between Collingwood and Hawthorn, and thus the claim that Collingwood scored more points than Hawthorn in that match is unsupported by the evidence in this dataset.

Assumptions noted
- I interpreted the claim as referring to a head-to-head 1962 VFL match between Collingwood and Hawthorn. If the intent was to compare their points scored in separate matches on the same date (23 June 1962), the data indicates Collingwood (74) outscored Hawthorn (67) that round.
- I treat the provided database as authoritative within its scope, but it appears to contain only a subset of the 1962 season (not the full fixture list), limiting verification of head-to-head outcomes.
