What I checked
- I first discovered the available data sources and found a single relevant table: vanity_performer (year, title, "us", "us r&b", "us dance"). This table captures Vanity’s singles and their US chart performance.

Evidence collected
1) List Vanity entries around the claimed years (1984–1987)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, title, "us" AS us_chart_position 
FROM vanity_performer 
WHERE year BETWEEN 1984 AND 1987;
Result excerpt:
- Pretty Mess — US 75 (1984)
- Mechanical Emotion — US 107 (1985)
- Under the Influence — US 56 (1986)
- Animals — US - (1986)

2) Retrieve full chart breakdown for the specific title
SQL executed:
SELECT year, title, "us", "us r&b", "us dance" 
FROM vanity_performer 
WHERE title ILIKE '%Under the Influence%';
Result:
- Year: 1986, Title: Under the Influence, US: 56, US R&B: 9, US Dance: 6

3) Verify 1985 entries explicitly
SQL executed:
SELECT year, title, "us" 
FROM vanity_performer 
WHERE year = 1985;
Result:
- Mechanical Emotion — US 107 (1985)

Conclusion
- The song “Under the Influence” (by Vanity) peaked at US #56 in 1986.
- There is no 1985 entry for “Under the Influence”; the only Vanity single listed for 1985 is “Mechanical Emotion” at US #107.

Therefore, the claim that “Under the Influence” charted at #56 in the US in 1985 and 1986 is only supported for 1986, not 1985.

Assumptions made
- “Under the Influence” refers to Vanity’s single captured in the vanity_performer table.
- The "us" column represents peak position on the US Billboard Hot 100 (or the primary US singles chart captured by this dataset).
