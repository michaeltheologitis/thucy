What I checked
- Data source: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season, which includes: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Interpretation of the claim
- I interpreted “3000s” as attendance between 3000 and 3999 inclusive, and “12000s” as attendance between 12000 and 12999 inclusive.
- I interpreted “total game feature” to mean all games in this table (no additional filters by venue or competition).

Evidence from the data
1) Count of games with attendance in the 3000s
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE attendance BETWEEN 3000 AND 3999;
- Result: 3

2) Full listing for the 3000s
- SQL: SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE attendance BETWEEN 3000 AND 3999 ORDER BY game;
- Rows:
  - Game 4 | 30 August 2008 | Aldershot Town | Away | 2 - 3 | 3805
  - Game 10 | 11 October 2008 | Accrington Stanley | Away | 3 - 2 | 3012
  - Game 12 | 21 October 2008 | Darlington | Away | 1 - 2 | 3034

3) Count of games with attendance in the 12000s
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE attendance BETWEEN 12000 AND 12999;
- Result: 17

4) Full listing for the 12000s
- SQL: SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE attendance BETWEEN 12000 AND 12999 ORDER BY game;

Assessment of the claim
- “3 … in the 3000s”: Supported by data (3 games).
- “… and 1 in the 12000s”: Not supported; the data show 17 games.

Conclusion
- The claim is partially correct for the 3000s but incorrect for the 12000s.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “game feature” as all games in the provided table.
- Interpreted “in the 3000s/12000s” as inclusive ranges 3000–3999 and 12000–12999.
- No filters by venue or competition; only non-null attendances considered.
