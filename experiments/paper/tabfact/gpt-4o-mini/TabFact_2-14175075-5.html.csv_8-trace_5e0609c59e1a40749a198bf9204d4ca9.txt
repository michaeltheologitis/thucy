Summary conclusion
- No. In the 2007 data, the earliest event date is September 4, 2007, and the sport is Men's Golf. There are no 2007 entries for gymnastics; women's gymnastics appears in 2008 in this dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available DB: public schema with one table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date text, site text, sport text, winning team text, series text).

Schema evidence (executed via schema tool)
- Table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
  Columns: date (text), site (text), sport (text), winning team (text), series (text)
  Keys/constraints: none

Evidence 1: Inspect sample 2007 rows to understand date format
- Result (sample shown by tool): dates like "september 4 , 2007", "september 8 , 2007" etc., indicating month-day-year with extra spaces around comma.
- Executed SQL (as returned):
SELECT date, site, sport FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series LIMIT 10;

Evidence 2: Properly parse dates and list earliest 2007 events
- Result (ordered earliest to later within 2007):
  1) September 4, 2007 — Men's Golf
  2) September 8, 2007 — Volleyball
  3) September 9, 2007 — Women's Soccer
  4) September 15, 2007 — Football
  5) November 10, 2007 — Men's Cross Country
  6) November 10, 2007 — Women's Cross Country
  7) December 5, 2007 — Women's Basketball
  8) December 7, 2007 — Women's Swimming
  9) December 8, 2007 — Men's Basketball
  10) December 9, 2007 — Wrestling
- Executed SQL:
WITH cleaned AS (
  SELECT
    date AS raw_date,
    regexp_replace(trim(date), '\s+,\s+', ', ') AS date_cleaned,
    sport
  FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
),
parsed AS (
  SELECT
    raw_date,
    sport,
    TO_DATE(date_cleaned, 'Month DD, YYYY') AS dt
  FROM cleaned
  WHERE date_cleaned ~ '[0-9]{4}'
)
SELECT dt, raw_date, sport
FROM parsed
WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM dt) = 2007
ORDER BY dt ASC, sport
LIMIT 20;

Evidence 3: Compute the single earliest 2007 date and the sport(s) on that date
- Result: earliest_date = 2007-09-04; sports_on_earliest_date = {Men's Golf}
- Executed SQL:
WITH cleaned AS (
  SELECT
    date AS raw_date,
    regexp_replace(trim(date), '\s+,\s+', ', ') AS date_cleaned,
    sport
  FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
),
parsed AS (
  SELECT
    raw_date,
    sport,
    TO_DATE(date_cleaned, 'Month DD, YYYY') AS dt
  FROM cleaned
  WHERE date_cleaned ~ '[0-9]{4}'
)
, yr AS (
  SELECT * FROM parsed WHERE EXTRACT(YEAR FROM dt) = 2007
)
SELECT MIN(dt) AS earliest_date,
       ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT sport) FILTER (WHERE dt = (SELECT MIN(dt) FROM yr)) AS sports_on_earliest_date
FROM yr;

Evidence 4: Check for any 2007 gymnastics events
- Result: No 2007 entries with gymnastics; nearest entries are in 2008 (e.g., Feb 22, 2008; Mar 7, 2008 — w gymnastics).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, sport FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE sport ILIKE '%gymnastics%';

Conclusion
- The earliest 2007 event is Men's Golf on September 4, 2007. Therefore, women's gymnastics is not the sport with the earliest date in 2007 in this dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the question as: “Is women’s gymnastics the sport with the earliest event date in 2007 within the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series dataset?”
