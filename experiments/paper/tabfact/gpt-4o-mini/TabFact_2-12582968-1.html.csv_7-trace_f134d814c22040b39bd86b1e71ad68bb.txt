Conclusion: Lukáš Melich’s highest (best) finish as a junior was 5th place at the 1999 European Junior Championships in Riga, Latvia (64.20 m).

Evidence from data:
- Junior competitions found in the database and their positions:
  - 1999 European Junior Championships — Riga, Latvia — Position: 5th — Notes: 64.20 m
  - 1998 World Junior Championships — Annecy, France — Position: 10th — Notes: 61.51 m
- Best (lowest) numeric position among junior events: 5

Executed SQL queries (exact):
1) List all junior competitions
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes 
FROM luk_melich 
WHERE notes ILIKE '%Junior%' OR competition ILIKE '%Junior%';

2) Order junior competitions by best finishing position (pattern-based)
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes 
FROM luk_melich 
WHERE notes ILIKE '%Junior%' OR competition ILIKE '%Junior%' ORDER BY 
    CASE 
        WHEN position ILIKE '%1st%' THEN 1 
        WHEN position ILIKE '%2nd%' THEN 2 
        WHEN position ILIKE '%3rd%' THEN 3 
        WHEN position ILIKE '%4th%' THEN 4 
        WHEN position ILIKE '%5th%' THEN 5 
        ELSE 100 
    END;

3) Compute numeric position robustly and rank
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes, 
       CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(position, '[^0-9]', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) AS numeric_position
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE competition ILIKE '%junior%'
ORDER BY numeric_position ASC;

Assumptions made:
- “Junior” refers to competitions explicitly labeled with the word “Junior” in the competition or notes fields.
- “Highest finish” is interpreted as the best rank (lowest numeric position).
- The luk_melich.public.luk_melich table contains all of Lukáš Melich’s junior-level international competition results needed for this verification.
