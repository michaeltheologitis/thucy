Claim: “14 viral family have a replication site in the cytoplasm.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence
1) Distinct replication site values
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "replication site" FROM public.viral_disease;
- Result: cytoplasm; nucleus

2) Count of distinct families with replication site in the cytoplasm
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_families
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';
- Result: 14 distinct families

3) List of the families (transparency check)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm' ORDER BY family ASC;
- Result:
  Arenaviridae; Astroviridae; Bunyaviridae; Caliciviridae; Coronaviridae; Filoviridae; Flaviviridae; Hepeviridae; Paramyxoviridae; Picornaviridae; Poxviridae; Reoviridae; Rhabdoviridae; Togaviridae

4) Sanity checks
- Total distinct families
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count FROM public.viral_disease;
  - Result: 23
- Distinct families with replication site in the nucleus
  - SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS nucleus_family_count FROM public.viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
  - Result: 9
- Note: 14 (cytoplasm) + 9 (nucleus) = 23 (total), which is consistent.

Conclusion
- The data shows 14 distinct viral families replicate in the cytoplasm. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “viral family” as distinct values in the family column.
- Interpreted “replication site in the cytoplasm” as rows where the replication site field equals 'cytoplasm' (case-sensitive, exact match).
