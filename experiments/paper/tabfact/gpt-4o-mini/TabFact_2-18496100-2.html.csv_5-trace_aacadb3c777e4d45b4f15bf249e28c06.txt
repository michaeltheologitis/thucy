Claim interpreted: The user asserts that, within the available data, Bhind district appears 3 times and Datia appears 5 times (“the result be count in bhind district 3 time and 5 time in datia”).

What the data shows:
- In the table of segments for the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency, entries associated with the district field show 5 records for Bhind and 3 records for Datia, not the other way around.

Evidence (query results summarized):
- District counts:
  - Bhind: 5 entries
  - Datia: 3 entries
- Example rows that mention Bhind or Datia in the district column include assembly segments: Ater, Bhind, Lahar, Mehgaon, Gohad (Bhind); Sewda, Bhander, Datia (Datia), each with elector counts (2009).

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) To list rows mentioning Bhind or Datia:
SELECT * FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE district ILIKE '%Bhind%' OR district ILIKE '%Datia%';

2) To count entries per district (case-insensitive):
SELECT district, COUNT(*) AS entry_count 
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
WHERE LOWER(district) IN ('bhind', 'datia') 
GROUP BY district;

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data. The data shows 5 entries for Bhind district and 3 for Datia, not 3 for Bhind and 5 for Datia.

Assumptions:
- Because the request was ambiguous, I interpreted “count … 3 time … and 5 time” as the number of records (assembly segments/entries) associated with each district in the available Bhind Lok Sabha constituency dataset, as no other datasets (e.g., counting rounds, recounts, or election result tallies) were available in the connected data sources.
