Claim to verify: "player shabazz muhammad stand 6 - 11 in height and be from jersey city , nj"

Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database TabFact with table public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team (columns: player text, height text, school text, hometown text, college text).

Evidence from data:
1) Locate Shabazz Muhammad
- SQL:
  SELECT player, height, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE '%shabazz%';
- Result:
  Player: Shabazz Muhammad; Height: 6 - 6; Hometown: Las Vegas, NV

2) Check if any Shabazz has height 6 - 11
- SQL:
  SELECT player, height, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE '%shabazz%' AND height = '6 - 11';
- Result: No rows returned

3) Check if any Shabazz is from Jersey City, NJ
- SQL:
  SELECT player, height, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE '%shabazz%' AND hometown ILIKE '%Jersey City%';
- Result: No rows returned

4) Sanity check that Jersey City, NJ appears in this dataset (not tied to Shabazz)
- SQL:
  SELECT player, height, hometown, school FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE hometown ILIKE '%Jersey City%';
- Result:
  Player: Myles Mack; Height: 5 - 9; Hometown: Jersey City, NJ; School: St Anthony High School

Conclusion: The dataset shows Shabazz Muhammad is listed at 6 - 6 and from Las Vegas, NV. There is no record of him being 6 - 11 nor from Jersey City, NJ. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "stand 6 - 11" is interpreted as height exactly '6 - 11' in the table’s height field.
- "from jersey city , nj" is interpreted as the hometown field matching Jersey City, NJ.
- "player shabazz muhammad" refers to the player entry named Shabazz Muhammad in this dataset.
