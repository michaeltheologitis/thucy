Claim evaluated: “the 49ers lose 2 out of 14 game in the 1947 season.”

Findings from the available data source (public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season):
- Total games: 14
- Wins: 8
- Losses: 4
- Ties: 2
- Therefore, the 49ers did not lose 2 games; they lost 4 games. Their 1947 record was 8–4–2.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL):
1) Outcome totals
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'w' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN result = 'l' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN result = 't' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ties 
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;
Result: total_games=14, wins=8, losses=4, ties=2

2) Breakdown by outcome code
SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) 
FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season 
GROUP BY result;
Result: result='w'→8, 'l'→4, 't'→2

3) Distinct outcome values and sample rows (to understand encoding)
SQL (distinct outcomes):
SELECT DISTINCT result FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;
Result: 'w', 'l', 't'

SQL (sample rows):
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season LIMIT 10;
Sample shows outcomes labeled as lowercase 'w', 'l', 't' and records accumulating to 8–4–2 by Week 10.

Conclusion: The data shows 4 losses in a 14-game 1947 season, not 2. The claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “49ers” refers to the San Francisco 49ers professional football team.
- The table public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season represents the team’s 1947 regular-season games and outcomes, with result encoded as 'w' (win), 'l' (loss), and 't' (tie).
