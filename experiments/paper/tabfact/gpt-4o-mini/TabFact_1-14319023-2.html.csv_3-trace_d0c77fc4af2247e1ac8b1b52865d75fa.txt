Claim to verify:
“In 2007, the girls’ doubles champions were Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati, and the mixed doubles champions were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.”

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with a user-visible schema “public” containing the table “indonesian_national_badminton_championships”.
  SQL executed to list schemas and tables:
  SELECT n.nspname AS schema_name,
         c.relname AS table_name,
         d.description AS table_description
  FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace n
  JOIN pg_catalog.pg_class c ON c.relnamespace = n.oid
  LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_description d ON d.objoid = c.oid
  WHERE c.relkind = 'r'
    AND n.nspname NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
  ORDER BY schema_name, table_name;
  Result: public | indonesian_national_badminton_championships

Table structure check:
- Columns present: year (bigint), boys singles (text), girls singles (text), boys doubles (text), girls doubles (text), mixed doubles (text). No primary key defined.
  SQL executed to list columns:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'indonesian_national_badminton_championships'
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  Result (relevant): year | bigint; girls doubles | text; mixed doubles | text

Evidence for 2007 winners:
- Girls’ doubles winners for 2007
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2007;
  Result: Anneke Feinya Agustin, Wenny Setiawati

- Mixed doubles winners for 2007
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2007;
  Result: Wifqi Windarto, Debby Susanto

Conclusion:
- The data directly supports the claim: In 2007, girls’ doubles were won by Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati; mixed doubles were won by Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.

Assumptions made:
- “girl double” refers to the “girls doubles” category as represented in the table column named "girls doubles".
- The event referenced is the Indonesian National Badminton Championships, consistent with the available data source.
