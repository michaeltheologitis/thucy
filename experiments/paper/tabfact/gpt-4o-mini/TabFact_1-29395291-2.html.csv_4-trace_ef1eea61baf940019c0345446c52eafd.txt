Conclusion: The dataset shows that Vodafone in Egypt had 8,704 thousand subscribers in 2006 (i.e., 8.704 million). If the claim “8704” is intended in thousands, it is correct. If interpreted as a raw count of 8,704 subscribers, it is not correct.

Evidence from data
- Source table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
- Relevant columns: provider, country, subscribers (2006) (thousands)

Executed SQL and result excerpt:
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %" FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa ORDER BY country, provider;

Returned rows (excerpt of interest):
- Provider: Vodafone | Country: Egypt | Subscribers (2005) (thousands): 6125 | Subscribers (2006) (thousands): 8704 | Growth %: 42

Interpretation of units:
- The subscribers columns in the table are explicitly labeled “(thousands)”. Therefore, the value 8704 means 8,704 thousand subscribers, i.e., 8,704,000.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to subscriber counts as reported in this dataset’s unit (thousands).
- “Vodafone” corresponds to Vodafone Egypt (Vodafone Misr) in the Egypt market.
