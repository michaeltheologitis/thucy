Claim interpreted: The user asserts that a crowd of 66,189 attended the game where the team’s record was 6–1 on Week 8.

What the data shows:
- The only available data source pertains to the 2001 St. Louis Rams season (table: public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season).
- Week 7 lists a game versus the New Orleans Saints with a record of 6–1 and attendance of 66,189.
- Week 8 has no recorded game (fields are empty/placeholder), implying a bye week and no attendance.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Query focusing on Weeks 7 and 8
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance
FROM public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season
WHERE week IN (7, 8)
ORDER BY week;
Result:
- Week 7: Date = October 28, 2001; Opponent = New Orleans Saints; Result = L 34 - 31; Record = 6 - 1; Attendance = 66,189
- Week 8: Date = -; Opponent = -; Result = -; Record = -; Attendance = -

2) Full season overview (for context)
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, record, attendance 
FROM public.t_2001_st_louis_rams_season 
ORDER BY week;
Excerpt of relevant rows:
- Week 7: New Orleans Saints; L 34 - 31; Record = 6 - 1; Attendance = 66,189
- Week 8: No game recorded (all key fields missing)

Conclusion:
- The attendance figure (66,189) and the 6–1 record both correspond to Week 7, not Week 8. Week 8 has no recorded game or attendance in this dataset.

Verdict rationale:
- The claim ties the correct attendance and record to the wrong week. Because Week 8 had no game, stating that 66,189 attended “on week 8” is incorrect, even though those numbers match Week 7.

Assumptions:
- “Crowd attend” refers to the attendance field.
- The claim pertains to the 2001 St. Louis Rams season (the only available dataset) and uses the dataset’s week numbering.
