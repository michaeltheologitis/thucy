Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing the table beyond_software, which includes columns relevant to title, genre, and platforms (e.g., zx spectrum, c = 64, and an others field that can include additional platforms).
- Schema retrieval SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'beyond_software';

- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, title, genre, "zx spectrum", "c = 64", others, format

  WHERE title ILIKE '%spy%' OR title ILIKE '%spy vs spy%';
- Result excerpt:
  - Year: 1984; Title: spy vs spy; Genre: arcade; zx spectrum: zx spectrum; c = 64: c64; Others: amstrad cpc; Format: tape.

2) Exact title match for confirmation

Assessment
- Genre: The record lists the genre as “Arcade,” supporting the claim that the game is in the arcade genre.
