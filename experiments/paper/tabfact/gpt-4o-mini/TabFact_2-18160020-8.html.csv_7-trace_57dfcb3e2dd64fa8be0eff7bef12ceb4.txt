Summary
- Claim: “miguel zapata have exactly 24 goal under his name.”
- Data environment explored: A PostgreSQL database with a public table t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b containing goalkeeper stats (goals conceded, matches, average, team) for the 2008–09 Segunda División B season.

What the data shows
- The table’s columns: goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision), team (text). In this dataset, “goals” refers to goals conceded by the goalkeeper.
- Searching for Miguel Zapata yields a single record with goals = 17, not 24.

Executed SQL evidence and results
1) Retrieve details for goalkeeper named Miguel Zapata
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE 'Miguel Zapata';
Result:
[{"average":0.61,"goalkeeper":"miguel zapata","goals":17,"matches":28,"team":"atlético ciudad"}]

2) Verify number of goals for Miguel Zapata
SQL:
SELECT goals FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE 'Miguel Zapata';
Result:
[{"goals":17}]

3) Broader name match (case-insensitive contains both “Miguel” and “Zapata”)
SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team 
FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b 
WHERE goalkeeper ILIKE '%Miguel%' AND goalkeeper ILIKE '%Zapata%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: Miguel Zapata; goals: 17; matches: 28; average: 0.61; team: Atlético Ciudad

Conclusion
- The data shows Miguel Zapata has 17 goals (conceded) in this dataset, not 24. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and scope
- Interpreted “goal under his name” as the “goals” field for the goalkeeper in the 2008–09 Segunda División B dataset (goals conceded, not scored).
- If the claim refers to a different competition, season, or a different definition of “goals,” it is outside the scope of the available data used here.
