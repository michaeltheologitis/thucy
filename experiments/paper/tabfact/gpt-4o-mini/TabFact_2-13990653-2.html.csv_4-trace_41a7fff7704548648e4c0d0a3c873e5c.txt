Claim interpreted: “Macoto Cobras were the opponent when Horacio Estrada took the loss.”

Data source explored
- Available table: public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season (date TEXT, opponent TEXT, score TEXT, loss TEXT, save TEXT)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find games where the losing pitcher is Horacio Estrada
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss ILIKE 'Horacio Estrada';
Result:
- Date: 3 / 18; Opponent: La New Bears; Score: 4 - 1; Loss: horacio estrada

2) Confirm distinct opponents for any Estrada loss entries
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent, date FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss LIKE '%estrada%';
Result:
- Opponent: la new bears; Date: 3 / 18

3) List all distinct opponents in the season (to show Macoto Cobras appear as an opponent generally, but not for Estrada’s loss)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season;
Result:
- La New Bears; Brother Elephants; Macoto Cobras; Chinatrust Whales

Assessment
- The only game in this dataset where Horacio Estrada is recorded as the losing pitcher lists the opponent as La New Bears, not Macoto Cobras.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data: when Horacio Estrada took the loss, the opponent was La New Bears.

Assumptions
- “Macoto cobra” refers to the CPBL team “Macoto Cobras.”
- “Horacio Estrada be the loss” refers to the losing pitcher field (loss) containing the name Horacio Estrada in the 2007 Uni-President Lions season dataset.
