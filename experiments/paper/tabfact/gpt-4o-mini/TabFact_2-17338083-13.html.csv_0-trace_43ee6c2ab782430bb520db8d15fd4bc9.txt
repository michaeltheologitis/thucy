Claim interpreted: “From 830 BC, the state be Song.” I interpret this as asserting that, in the authoritative dataset available, there is a record indicating the State of Song associated with a start year of 830 BC (likely the start of a ruler’s tenure).

Data source discovery:
- Identified database: a PostgreSQL source with table public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc, containing state leadership information relevant to the 820s BC period.

Schema summary (relevant fields):
- state (text), type (text), name (text), title (text), royal house (text), from (text).

Evidence collected:
1) Confirm that “Song” appears as a state in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT state FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc;
- Result excerpt (distinct states include): cai, chen, lu, yan, chu, wey, qi, cao, song, qin, jin.

2) Retrieve the entry for the State of Song with its start year
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT state, name, title, "royal house" AS royal_house, "from" 
  FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc 
  WHERE LOWER(state)='song';
- Result:
  - state: Song
  - name: Hui
  - title: Duke
  - royal_house: -
  - from: 830 BC

3) Cross-check entries mentioning “830” in the start year
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT state, name, title, "from" 
  FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc 
  WHERE "from" ILIKE '%830%';
- Result:
  - state: Song; name: Hui; title: Duke; from: 830 BC

Assessment:
- The dataset explicitly contains an entry for the State of Song with a “from” date of 830 BC (Duke Hui of Song). This directly supports the claim as interpreted.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “from 830 bc , the state be song” is interpreted to mean that the database records associate the State of Song with the start year 830 BC (specifically as the beginning of the listed ruler’s tenure).
