Claim to verify: “the only total that appear more than 2 time be 31.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public
- Table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  - Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text)
  - Notably contains a column named total

Checks performed and evidence
1) Identify all total values that occur more than 2 times
SQL Executed:
SELECT total, COUNT(*) AS freq
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
GROUP BY total
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY freq DESC, total;
Result:
- total = 22, freq = 3
Interpretation: The only total value appearing more than 2 times is 22.

2) Directly check frequency of total = 31
SQL Executed:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE total = 31;
Result:
- count = 1
Interpretation: The value 31 appears only once, not more than 2 times.

Conclusion
- The data shows that the only total value with frequency greater than 2 is 22, not 31. The value 31 appears once.

Answer: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “total” refers to the total column in public.list_of_sumo_record_holders.
- “appear more than 2 time” is interpreted as occurring at least 3 times in the table.
- Scope is limited to the available dataset identified above.
