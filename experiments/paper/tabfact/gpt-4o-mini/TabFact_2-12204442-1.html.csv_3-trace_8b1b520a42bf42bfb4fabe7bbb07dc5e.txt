3) Check where speed is 56 mph
Executed SQL:

Assessment
- The 200-foot Giant Drop installation (Canada’s Wonderland) has a listed speed of 62 mph, not 56 mph.
- The 56 mph speed in this dataset corresponds to a 100-foot Giant Drop at Carowinds, not a 200-foot drop.

Conclusion
- The claim that the 200-foot Giant Drop’s speed is 56 mph is contradicted by the data. The correct speed shown is 62 mph for the 200-foot installation.

Assumptions
- “giant drop 200 foot” refers to the Giant Drop installation with a 200-foot drop height as represented in the table (Canada’s Wonderland).
