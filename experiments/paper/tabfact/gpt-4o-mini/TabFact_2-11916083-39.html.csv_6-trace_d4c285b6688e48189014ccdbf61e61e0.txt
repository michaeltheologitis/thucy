Summary conclusion:
- The data show no Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin released in 2001 with a mintage of 31,997. However, a coin with mintage 31,997 exists for the year 2003 (theme: hmcs bras dor). Therefore, the claim that the 31,997 mintage was released in 2001 is not supported by the data.

Data source context:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
- Columns: year (bigint), theme (text), artist (text), mintage (text), issue price (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for exact mintage text match in 2001
- Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE year = 2001 AND mintage = '31,997';

2) Broad search in 2001 for mintage containing 31,997 (with or without comma)
- Result: 0 rows
- SQL executed:
SELECT year, theme, mintage FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE year = 2001 AND (mintage ILIKE '%31,997%' OR mintage ILIKE '%31997%')

3) Broad search across all years for mintage containing 31,997 (with or without comma)
- Result: 1 row
  - year: 2003
  - theme: hmcs bras dor
  - mintage: 31997
- SQL executed:
SELECT year, theme, mintage FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE mintage ILIKE '%31,997%' OR mintage ILIKE '%31997%'

Conclusion based on data:
- No entries for 2001 have a mintage of 31,997, while 2003 does. The claim that the 31,997 mintage was released in 2001 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “31997 mintage” as a mintage count of 31,997 for a Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin.
- Interpreted “release in 2001” as the coin’s issue year in the Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (2000s) dataset.
