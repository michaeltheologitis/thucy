Claim interpreted: “The player with the highest number of league goals is Ian Robin.”

Data source discovered:
- Database schema: public
- Table: t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
- Relevant columns: name (text), league goals (bigint), plus other appearance/goal fields

Step 1: Identify the top league goal scorers
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals"
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
ORDER BY "league goals" DESC
LIMIT 5;

Result (top 5 by league goals):
1) Ian Robins — 25
2) Peter Fletcher — 17
3) Steve Kindon — 14
4) David Cowling — 10
5) Brian Stanton — 9

Step 2: Check for a player named “Ian Robin” (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals"
FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE LOWER('%Ian Robin%');

Result:
- Ian Robins — 25 (name contains the substring “Ian Robin”)

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows the highest league goal scorer is Ian Robins (25). The claim names “Ian Robin,” which appears to be the same player but with the surname missing the final “s.” Therefore, the substance of the claim (identifying the top league scorer) aligns with the data, but the player’s name is slightly inaccurate.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town FC season dataset available in the environment.
- “Ian Robin” is intended to refer to “Ian Robins,” whose name contains the substring “Ian Robin.”
