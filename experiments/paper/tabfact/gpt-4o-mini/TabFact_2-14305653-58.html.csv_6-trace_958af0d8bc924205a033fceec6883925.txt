Claim to verify: “the Yugoslavian national team suffer its worst outcome lose 2:1 in the balken cup against poland on march 22.”

Data source overview
- Database: public
- Table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
- Columns: date (text), city (text), opponent (text), results (text), "type of game" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Did Yugoslavia play Poland in the Balkan Cup?
- Result: No rows found (no Yugoslavia vs Poland matches labeled as Balkan Cup).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent = 'Poland' AND "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan%';

2) What Balkan Cup matches exist in the dataset?
- Result: Only matches vs Romania are present; no Poland.
  • Date: March 30 | City: Belgrade | Opponent: Romania | Results: 2:0 | Type of Game: Balkan Cup
  • Date: August 27 | City: Bucharest, Romania | Opponent: Romania | Results: 1:4 | Type of Game: Balkan Cup
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE LOWER("type of game") LIKE '%balkan%';

3) Any Yugoslavia vs Poland match in the dataset (any competition)?
- Result: One match, but it’s a Friendly, not Balkan Cup; result 2:1.
  • Date: April 26 | City: Borovo | Opponent: Poland | Results: 2:1 | Type of Game: Friendly
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent = 'Poland' OR opponent ILIKE '%Poland%';

4) Any match on March 22?
- Result: No rows with date containing “March 22” or “22 March.”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE date LIKE '%March 22%' OR date LIKE '%22 March%';

5) Was 2:1 the team’s “worst outcome” in the Balkan Cup?
- Analysis within Balkan Cup entries: the worst loss recorded is 1:4 vs Romania (goal difference 3 against Yugoslavia). A 2:1 loss (goal difference 1) would not be the worst. Also, there is no Balkan Cup match vs Poland at all.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, results,
         CASE
             WHEN yugoslavia_goals > opponent_goals THEN 'Win'
             WHEN yugoslavia_goals < opponent_goals THEN 'Loss'
             ELSE 'Draw'
         END AS outcome,
         (opponent_goals - yugoslavia_goals) AS goal_diff
  FROM (
      SELECT date, opponent, results,
             CAST(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) AS yugoslavia_goals,
             CAST(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER) AS opponent_goals
      FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
      WHERE "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan%'
  ) AS goals_subquery
  WHERE (CASE
             WHEN yugoslavia_goals > opponent_goals THEN 'Win'
             WHEN yugoslavia_goals < opponent_goals THEN 'Loss'
             ELSE 'Draw'
         END) = 'Loss'
  ORDER BY goal_diff DESC;

Conclusion
- No evidence of a Yugoslavia vs Poland match in the Balkan Cup.
- The only Yugoslavia vs Poland match in the dataset is a Friendly on April 26 with a 2:1 result (which, based on column convention, indicates a Yugoslavia win, not a loss).
- No match dated March 22 is found.
- The worst Balkan Cup defeat in the dataset is 1:4 vs Romania, not 1:2 vs Poland.

Verdict: Inaccurate

Assumptions made
- “Yugoslavian national team” refers to the Yugoslavia national football team.
- “Balken Cup” is interpreted as the Balkan Cup (football).
- The results column is in the format YugoslaviaGoals:OpponentGoals.
