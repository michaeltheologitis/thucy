Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and focused on the Indianapolis Colts draft history table.
- Reviewed the schema to understand available fields (includes round, pick, overall, name, position, college; no year column).
- Queried for Glenn Capriola to determine his draft round and to check for any occurrences earlier than round 6.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history (Indianapolis Colts draft history).

Schema details
- Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text). No explicit primary key; all rows pertain to Colts draft picks.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any records for the surname Capriola
- Result: 1 row found — Round: 9, Pick: 24, Overall: 247, Name: Glenn Capriola, Position: Running Back, College: Boston College.
- SQL executed:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%';

2) Check for any occurrences earlier than round 6
- Result: No rows found (i.e., no record of Glenn Capriola with round < 6).
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%' AND round < 6;

3) Compute the minimum round for Capriola
- Result: min_round = 9.
- SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(round) AS min_round FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%';

Conclusion
- The data shows Glenn Capriola appears once in the Colts draft history and was selected in round 9. There are no records of him being selected in a round earlier than 6. Therefore, the claim that he was not selected before round 6 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “Glenn Capriola was not selected before round 6” in the context of the Indianapolis Colts’ draft history (the available dataset).
- Assumed the intended spelling is “Glenn Capriola.” Queries also matched by surname to capture possible minor spelling variations.
- Scope is limited to Colts draft history due to the available data; no cross-team draft data was available in the connected sources.
