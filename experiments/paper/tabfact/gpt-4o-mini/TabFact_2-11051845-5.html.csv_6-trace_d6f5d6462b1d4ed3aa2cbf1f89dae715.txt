Claim to verify: "spiral galaxy have the most apparent magnitude"

Interpretation adopted: I interpret “most apparent magnitude” to mean “the largest (numerically highest) apparent magnitude values,” which correspond to the faintest objects. I evaluate this within the available NGC 5001–6000 dataset.

Data source discovered
- A PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (fields include object type and apparent magnitude).

Evidence from the data
1) Object types present and their counts
SQL:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 
GROUP BY "object type" 
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- Irregular Galaxy: 2
- Spiral Galaxy: 2
- Globular Cluster: 1

2) Apparent magnitude statistics by object type
SQL:
SELECT 
    "object type", 
    COUNT("apparent magnitude") AS count, 
    MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_magnitude, 
    AVG("apparent magnitude") AS average_magnitude, 
    MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_magnitude 
FROM 
    public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 
GROUP BY 
    "object type" 
ORDER BY 
    average_magnitude ASC;
Results:
- Spiral Galaxy: count=2, min=8.7, avg=10.3, max=11.9
- Globular Cluster: count=1, min=10.5, avg=10.5, max=10.5
- Irregular Galaxy: count=2, min=14.0, avg=14.25, max=14.5

3) Full list ordered by apparent magnitude (lower = brighter; higher = fainter)
SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude" 
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 
ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" ASC;
Results (ascending):
- NGC 5457 — Spiral Galaxy — 8.7 (brightest)
- NGC 5466 — Globular Cluster — 10.5
- NGC 5474 — Spiral Galaxy — 11.9
- NGC 5408 — Irregular Galaxy — 14.0
- NGC 5477 — Irregular Galaxy — 14.5 (faintest)

Assessment
- If “most apparent magnitude” means numerically largest magnitude (faintest), then irregular galaxies, not spiral galaxies, have the largest apparent magnitudes in this dataset (up to 14.5). Spiral galaxies are, on average, brighter (lower magnitudes) and include the brightest object (m=8.7).

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes
- I interpreted “most apparent magnitude” as the highest magnitude values (faintest). If the intent was “brightest” (lowest magnitude), spiral galaxies would include the brightest object here, but that is not what “most magnitude” typically means.
- Analysis is constrained to the available NGC 5001–6000 table; within these data, results are authoritative.
