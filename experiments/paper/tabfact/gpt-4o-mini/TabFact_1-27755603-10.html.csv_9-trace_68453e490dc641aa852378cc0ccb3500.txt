Claim to verify: “there be 2 instance where there be a tie for most rebound by detroit piston player during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
  - Description: Detroit Pistons 2010–2011 season game-level summary with fields including date, opponent team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and season record.

How ties are represented in the data
- The high rebounds field lists one or more Pistons players followed by the rebound count in parentheses. When multiple players share the top rebound count in a game, the player names are comma-separated (e.g., “player1, player2 (N)” or “player1, player2, player3 (N)”).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify all games where there is a tie for most rebounds (comma-separated names in the high rebounds field)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, team, "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%' ORDER BY date;
- Result (4 games):
  - Date: March 1, Team: Milwaukee, High Rebounds: Greg Monroe, Charlie Villanueva (9)
  - Date: March 6, Team: Washington, High Rebounds: Greg Monroe, Rodney Stuckey (7)
  - Date: March 12, Team: Denver, High Rebounds: Austin Daye, Ben Gordon, Greg Monroe (6)
  - Date: March 25, Team: Cleveland, High Rebounds: Chris Wilcox, Greg Monroe (8)

2) Count of such tie instances
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%';
- Result: 4

3) Pattern check to ensure we didn’t miss ties represented with other delimiters (none found)
- SQL (check for “ and ” or “ & ”):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" ILIKE '% and %' OR "high rebounds" ILIKE '% & %';
- Result: 0
- SQL (check for slash “/”):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%/%';
- Result: 0

Conclusion
- The data show 4 games with a tie for most rebounds by Detroit Pistons players in the 2010–2011 season data available, not 2. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The phrase “during this period of the 2010 - 2011 season” is interpreted as the entire 2010–2011 season captured in the table public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season.
- The high rebounds column records the Detroit Pistons’ team leaders for rebounds each game (as indicated by the Pistons player names appearing in sample rows).
