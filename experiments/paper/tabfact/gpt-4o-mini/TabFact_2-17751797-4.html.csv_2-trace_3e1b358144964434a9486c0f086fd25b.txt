- Schema: public
- Table: t_1990_91_fa_cup
  - Columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text)

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Search for the away team containing the distinctive term “Hove” (to capture possible formatting with “&”):
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "away team", "score", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE "away team" LIKE '%Hove%' OR "away team" LIKE '%&%'

Result:
- Tie No: 1; Home Team: Liverpool; Away Team: Brighton & Hove Albion; Score: 2 - 2; Date: 26 / 01 / 1991

2) Case-insensitive exact match on the away team “Brighton & Hove Albion”:
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "away team", "score", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE LOWER("away team") = LOWER('Brighton & Hove Albion')

Result:
- Tie No: 1; Home Team: Liverpool; Away Team: Brighton & Hove Albion; Score: 2 - 2; Date: 26 / 01 / 1991

Conclusion:
- The data shows a match where the away team was Brighton & Hove Albion and the score was 2 - 2 (Liverpool vs Brighton & Hove Albion, 26/01/1991). This supports the user's claim.

Assumptions made:
- “brighton and heave albion” is interpreted as “Brighton & Hove Albion.”
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (1990–91 FA Cup matches in the TabFact database).
