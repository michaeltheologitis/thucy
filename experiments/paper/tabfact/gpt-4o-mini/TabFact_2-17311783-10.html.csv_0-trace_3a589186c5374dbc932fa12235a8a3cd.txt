Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table in the public schema: t_2008_09_miami_heat_season (Miami Heat 2008–2009 season game log data).

Schema examined
- Table: public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence collected
1) Query to find games at “Verizon Center”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", record, score
FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Verizon%';
- Result:
  - date: april 4
  - team: washington
  - location attendance: verizon center 20173
  - record: 41 - 36
  - score: w 118 - 104 (ot)

2) Query to confirm the opponent entry for Washington
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", record, score 
FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season 
WHERE team ILIKE 'washington';
- Result:
  - date: April 4
  - team: Washington
  - location attendance: Verizon Center 20173
  - record: 41 - 36
  - score: W 118 - 104 (OT)

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “washington have a record of 41 - 36 and play at the verizon center 20173 people in attendance.”
- What the data shows:
  - There is a game against Washington at “Verizon Center” with listed attendance “20173.”
  - The “record” field for that row is “41 - 36.” In the context of this Miami Heat game log, the “record” represents the Miami Heat’s record at that point, not Washington’s.

Conclusion
- Venue and attendance: Verified. The game is listed at “Verizon Center” with “20173” attendance.
- Record attribution: The value “41 - 36” appears in the record field for that game, but it represents the Miami Heat’s record, not Washington’s. If the claim intends that “Washington have a record of 41 - 36,” the dataset does not support that attribution.

Final determination: The factual components (Verizon Center, 20,173 attendance, record field reading 41-36 in that game row) are supported, but the subject of the 41-36 record is misattributed if taken to refer to Washington.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “record” as the team-record field associated with the Miami Heat game log row, consistent with typical game log conventions and this table’s structure.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the specific Miami Heat at Washington game entry on April 4 in the 2008–09 season, given the available data scope.
