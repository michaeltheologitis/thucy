Claim interpreted: Dundee West has a lower swing-to-gain percentage than Western Isles.

Evidence from the available data source (Scottish Parliament General Election 2007):
- Dundee West: Swing to Gain = 2.13
- Western Isles: Swing to Gain = 2.91
- Comparison: 2.13 < 2.91, so Dundee West requires a lower swing to gain than Western Isles.

Executed SQL queries (as returned by the query tool):
1) Targeted retrieval for both constituencies:
SELECT constituency, result, "swing to gain" FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE LOWER(constituency) = 'dundee west' OR LOWER(constituency) = 'western isles';

2) Broader check using pattern matching:
SELECT constituency, result, "swing to gain"
FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE constituency ILIKE '%dundee%' OR constituency ILIKE '%western%'
ORDER BY constituency;

Findings:
- Both queries return Dundee West with swing to gain 2.13 and Western Isles with swing to gain 2.91, confirming the claim within this dataset.

Assumptions:
- “Swing to gain point” is interpreted as the “swing to gain” metric provided in the 2007 Scottish Parliament constituency data.
- “Western isle” refers to the constituency listed as “Western Isles” in the dataset.
