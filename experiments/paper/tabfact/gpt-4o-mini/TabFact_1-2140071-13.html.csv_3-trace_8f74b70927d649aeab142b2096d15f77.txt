Executed SQL:
SELECT season, episode, coach, "episode summary" 
FROM made_tv_series 
WHERE coach ILIKE 'Rebecca Star' OR coach ILIKE 'Rebecca Starr';
Result:
- Season: 13; Episode: 13; Coach: Rebecca Star; Episode Summary: Ashley is made into a circus performer

2) Query to retrieve full record for that episode
Executed SQL:

- Season: 13
- Episode: 13
- Coach: Rebecca Star
