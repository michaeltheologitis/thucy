Data sources discovered: TabFact database, public schema, table t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships (columns: rank bigint, name text, nation text, "sp + fs" bigint, points double precision, places double precision).

Question interpreted: Does West Germany have 2 athletes among the top 6 finishers but no medalists in the event represented by this table?

Evidence collected:
1) Top 6 finishers (to see placements and nations)
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank BETWEEN 1 AND 6 ORDER BY rank;
Result (abridged):
- 1: Mark Cockerell — United States
- 2: Takashi Mura — Japan
- 3: Brian Pockar — Canada
- 4: Norbert Schramm — West Germany
- 5: Andrew Bestwick — United Kingdom
- 6: Stephan Bril — West Germany
Interpretation: West Germany appears twice in the top 6 (ranks 4 and 6) and none in the top 3.

2) Distinct nation values (to confirm label for West Germany)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT nation FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships;
Result includes: West Germany (among others)
Interpretation: The nation label “West Germany” is present in this dataset.

3) Count of West Germany athletes in top 6
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_top_6 FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank <= 6 AND nation ILIKE '%West Germany%';
Result: 2

4) Count of West Germany medalists (top 3)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_medals FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank <= 3 AND nation ILIKE '%West Germany%';
Result: 0

Conclusion: The data shows West Germany has exactly two athletes in the top six (ranks 4 and 6) and zero medalists (no athletes in ranks 1–3). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Top 6” refers to ranks 1 through 6 in the table.
- “Win a medal” refers to finishing in ranks 1–3 (gold, silver, bronze).
