Claim: “shooto 2003: 3 / 18 be the event in turku, finland and have an opponent of rumina sato.”

Findings based on the data:
- The event “shooto 2003: 3 / 18” exists in the data and is located in Tokyo, Japan—not Turku, Finland.
- At that event, Joachim Hansen’s opponent was Rumina Sato. Hansen won by TKO (Punches).
- There are Shooto-branded events in Finland (including Turku), but they are different events (e.g., “shooto finland: the first time”) and are not “shooto 2003: 3 / 18”.

Evidence and executed SQL:

3) Check for any events located in Turku/Finland

- The location portion is contradicted: that event took place in Tokyo, Japan, not Turku, Finland.
