Claim to verify: “england , australia and the united state have the same number of player in the 1981 open championship with 5 each.”

What I checked
- Counted the number of players per country in the 1981 Open Championship dataset and verified using both total rows and distinct player names to guard against duplicates.

Evidence from data
1) Country counts (by rows)
Result:
- England: 5
- United States: 5
- Australia: 2
- Argentina: 1
- Japan: 1
- New Zealand: 1
- Scotland: 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count 
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY player_count DESC, country;

2) Country counts (by distinct players)
Result:
- England: 5
- United States: 5
- Australia: 2
- Argentina: 1
- Japan: 1
- New Zealand: 1
- Scotland: 1

Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count 
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship 
GROUP BY country 
ORDER BY player_count DESC, country;

Conclusion
- England and the United States each had 5 players.
- Australia had 2 players, not 5.
Therefore, the claim that all three had 5 players each is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The table t_1981_open_championship contains one row per player entry for the 1981 event and fully represents the field.
- The country column reflects each player’s nationality consistently. Distinct-count verification confirmed no duplicate naming affected the result.
