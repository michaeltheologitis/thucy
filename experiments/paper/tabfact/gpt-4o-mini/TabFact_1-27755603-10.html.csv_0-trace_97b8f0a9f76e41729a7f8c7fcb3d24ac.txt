FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE LOWER("high points") LIKE '%rodney stuckey%'
ORDER BY game;

Assumptions
- "This period" is interpreted as the full 2010–2011 season as represented by the table t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season. If a narrower date range was intended, results could differ and would require that specific range to be applied.
