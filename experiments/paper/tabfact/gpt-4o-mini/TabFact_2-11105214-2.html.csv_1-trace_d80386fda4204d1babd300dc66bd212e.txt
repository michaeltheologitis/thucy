Claim interpreted: The user asserts that for all constituencies in the dataset, the column "snp 's place 2003" equals "2nd" (i.e., SNP placed 2nd in 2003 everywhere in the table).

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
- Columns: rank, constituency, winning party 2003, swing to gain, snp 's place 2003, result

Evidence queries and results:
1) Total number of constituencies (rows)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_constituencies FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
- Result: 11

2) Distinct values in "snp 's place 2003" and their counts
- SQL: SELECT "snp 's place 2003", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 GROUP BY "snp 's place 2003" ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result: Value = 2nd, Count = 11

3) Count of rows where "snp 's place 2003" = '2nd'
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE "snp 's place 2003" = '2nd';
- Result: 11

4) Check for any exceptions (rows not equal to '2nd')
- SQL: SELECT constituency, "snp 's place 2003" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE "snp 's place 2003" <> '2nd';
- Result: No rows returned

Conclusion:
- All 11 constituencies in the available dataset have "snp 's place 2003" recorded as "2nd". The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "All of the constituency" refers to all rows in the table scottish_parliament_general_election_2007.
- The intent is to verify the column "snp 's place 2003" within this dataset, not to generalize beyond the scope of the table.
