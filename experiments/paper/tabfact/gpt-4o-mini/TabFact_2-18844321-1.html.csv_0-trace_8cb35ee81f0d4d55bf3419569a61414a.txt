Scope and data source discovery:
- Available dataset: a PostgreSQL database with a table on the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland.
- Table: public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
- Columns: "opposing team" (text), against (bigint), date (text), venue (text), status (text)

Key schema check (to understand status values):
SQL:

Main verification (count ‘tour match’ in Oct–Dec 1978):
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE status = 'tour match'
  AND to_date(date, 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-12-31';
Result: match_count = 14

Monthly breakdown for additional confirmation:
SQL:
SELECT TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY'), 'YYYY-MM') AS month, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE status = 'tour match' AND TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') BETWEEN DATE '1978-10-01' AND DATE '1978-12-31'
GROUP BY month
ORDER BY month;
Results:
- 1978-10: 5

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland (the only available dataset). If the claim intended a different sport or tour, that data was not available in the connected sources.
- “Last 3 month of 1978” is interpreted as October 1 through December 31, 1978.
- “tour match” is defined by rows where status = 'tour match' in the dataset.
