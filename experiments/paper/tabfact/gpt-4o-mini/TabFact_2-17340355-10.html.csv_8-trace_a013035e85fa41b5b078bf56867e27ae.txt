Claim to verify: “the game against minnesota have a lower attendance than the game against new orleans.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema with table t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season data).

Relevant schema (as discovered)
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text).
- The team column represents the opponent (e.g., “minnesota”, “new orleans”). The "location attendance" field contains venue name and, when available, the numeric attendance at the end of the string.

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve attendance for games against Minnesota and New Orleans and parse numeric attendance from the end of the location/attendance string.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance" as location_attendance, (regexp_match("location attendance", '([0-9]+)$'))[1]::int as attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team IN ('minnesota','new orleans')
ORDER BY date;

Result:
- Date: April 8 | Team: New Orleans | Location Attendance: New Orleans Arena 17781 | Attendance: 17,781
- Date: April 11 | Team: Minnesota   | Location Attendance: Target Center 18478    | Attendance: 18,478

2) Check how many rows exist for each of these opponents (to confirm we are comparing like-for-like entries in this dataset).
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS games
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team IN ('minnesota','new orleans')
GROUP BY team;

Result:
- Minnesota: 1 game
- New Orleans: 1 game

Analysis
- In the available 2008–09 Phoenix Suns dataset, there is one recorded game versus Minnesota (attendance 18,478) and one recorded game versus New Orleans (attendance 17,781).
- Therefore, the game against Minnesota did not have a lower attendance than the game against New Orleans; it had a higher attendance.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the accessible dataset.

Assumptions
- The term “the game” is interpreted as the single game against each opponent present in this dataset, since only one row exists for each opponent. If multiple games existed in the dataset, we would compare the specific games in question or compute a like-for-like metric (e.g., same venue or first chronological meeting).
