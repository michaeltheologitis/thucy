Claim to verify: "the shortest time between 2 consecutive match be 2 day"

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema containing one table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (Sheffield Wednesday FC, 2000–2001 season).

Schema (from the data source)
- date (text): match date (e.g., "13 August 2000").
- opponent (text): opponent team name.
- venue (text): match venue indicator (e.g., H/A).
- result (text): score/result string.
- attendance (bigint): attendance.

Method
- Parse the text date to a date using to_date(trim(date), 'DD Month YYYY').
- Order matches by parsed date and compute the gap in days between strictly consecutive matches using a window-style approach (row_number and adjacent join).
- Find the minimum gap and list the pairs that achieve it.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Minimum gap between strictly consecutive matches
- Result: Minimum gap is 2 days.
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed_dates AS (
      SELECT 
          to_date(trim(date), 'DD Month YYYY') AS match_date,
          opponent,
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY to_date(trim(date), 'DD Month YYYY')) AS match_order
      FROM 
          public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  ),
  consecutive_matches AS (
      SELECT 
          a.match_date AS date1,
          a.opponent AS opponent1,
          b.match_date AS date2,
          b.opponent AS opponent2,
          (b.match_date - a.match_date) AS gap_days
      FROM 
          parsed_dates a
      JOIN 
          parsed_dates b ON a.match_order + 1 = b.match_order
  )
  SELECT
      MIN(gap_days) AS min_gap
  FROM 
      consecutive_matches;

2) Consecutive match pairs that achieve the minimum gap
- Result pairs (all with 2 days gap):
  - 26 August 2000 (vs Grimsby Town) → 28 August 2000 (vs Blackburn Rovers)
  - 30 December 2000 (vs Huddersfield Town) → 1 January 2001 (vs Grimsby Town)
  - 14 April 2001 (vs Crystal Palace) → 16 April 2001 (vs Fulham)
- Executed SQL:
  WITH parsed_dates AS (
      SELECT 
          to_date(trim(date), 'DD Month YYYY') AS match_date,
          opponent,
          ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY to_date(trim(date), 'DD Month YYYY')) AS match_order
      FROM 
          public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season
  ),
  consecutive_matches AS (
      SELECT 
          a.match_date AS date1,
          a.opponent AS opponent1,
          b.match_date AS date2,
          b.opponent AS opponent2,
          (b.match_date - a.match_date) AS gap_days
      FROM 
          parsed_dates a
      JOIN 
          parsed_dates b ON a.match_order + 1 = b.match_order
  )
  SELECT
      date1,
      opponent1,
      date2,
      opponent2,
      gap_days
  FROM 
      consecutive_matches
  WHERE 
      gap_days = 2;

Conclusion
- The data shows the shortest time between two strictly consecutive matches in this dataset is 2 days. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the only available dataset: Sheffield Wednesday FC’s 2000/01 season. "Consecutive match" is taken to mean consecutive fixtures for Sheffield Wednesday ordered by match date within this season.
