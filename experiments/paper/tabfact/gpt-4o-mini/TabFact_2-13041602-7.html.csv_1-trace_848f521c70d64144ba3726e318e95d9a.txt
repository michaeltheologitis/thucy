Interpretation of the claim:
- Interpreted as: In the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season schedule, the Brewers played the Cincinnati Reds immediately after a series against the San Diego Padres.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with a single relevant table: t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season.

Schema summary for t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season:
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence from the data:
1) Initial inspection of schedule order shows Padres games followed by Reds games in early September.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season LIMIT 20;
- Result excerpt (date → opponent):
  september 1 → padres
  september 2 → padres
  september 3 → padres
  september 4 → padres
  september 5 → reds
  september 6 → reds
  september 7 → reds
  (Further rows show subsequent opponents.)

2) Direct verification for September 1–7 confirms Padres (Sept 1–4) then Reds (Sept 5–7).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE date IN ('september 1', 'september 2', 'september 3', 'september 4', 'september 5', 'september 6', 'september 7');
- Result:
  September 1: Padres
  September 2: Padres
  September 3: Padres
  September 4: Padres
  September 5: Reds
  September 6: Reds
  September 7: Reds

Conclusion:
- The data shows that, at least in the early September portion of the 2005 schedule, the Brewers played the Reds immediately after a series against the Padres. This supports the interpreted claim.

Assumptions made:
- “the red” refers to the Cincinnati Reds and “the padre” refers to the San Diego Padres.
- The user’s intent was to assert that the opponent immediately following a Padres series (at some point in 2005) was the Reds, not necessarily claiming this for every Padres series throughout the season.
- Dates are taken as presented in the dataset (e.g., 'september 1') and the table reflects chronological order around the cited dates.
