Claim interpreted: “Four of the Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have two different uniform numbers.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with a single relevant table: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
- Schema (key columns):
  - quarterback (text)
  - uniform no (s) (text)
  - games started (bigint), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), winning pct (double precision)

Method
- Parse the “uniform no (s)” field to count how many distinct uniform numbers each starting QB has, assuming numbers are comma-separated. Count quarterbacks with exactly two numbers.

Evidence
1) List of Browns starting QBs with exactly two uniform numbers
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, "uniform no (s)",
       cardinality(regexp_split_to_array(regexp_replace("uniform no (s)", '\\s', '', 'g'), ',')) AS number_count
FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE cardinality(regexp_split_to_array(regexp_replace("uniform no (s)", '\\s', '', 'g'), ',')) = 2
ORDER BY quarterback;

Result:
- Graham, Otto — 60, 14 (number_count = 2)
- Ninowski, Jim — 15, 11 (number_count = 2)
- Ratterman, George — 12, 16 (number_count = 2)

2) Count of Browns starting QBs with exactly two numbers
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS qbs_with_exactly_two_numbers
FROM (
  SELECT quarterback,
         cardinality(regexp_split_to_array(regexp_replace("uniform no (s)", '\\s', '', 'g'), ',')) AS number_count
  FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
) t
WHERE t.number_count = 2;

Result:
- qbs_with_exactly_two_numbers = 3

Conclusion
- The data shows 3 Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks with exactly two uniform numbers, not 4.

Assumptions
- “start quarterback” interpreted as “starting quarterbacks.”
- “have 2 different uniform number” interpreted as “wore exactly two distinct uniform numbers” based on the comma-separated values in the “uniform no (s)” field.
- Verification relies solely on the provided authoritative table list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.
