Data source discovery
- Connected database: TabFact (Table-based Fact Verification)
- Available table: public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games
- Columns: name (text), bodyweight (double precision), snatch (text), clean & jerk (text), total (kg) (text)

Evidence 1: How many lifters have a snatch of 153.0?
- Result: 1 row found
- Row details: name = christian lópez ( gua ), bodyweight = 104.7
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, bodyweight 
FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games 
WHERE snatch ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' AND snatch::double precision = 153.0;

Evidence 2: Verify that the lifter with snatch 153.0 has bodyweight 104.70 and that there is exactly one such row
- Result: Exactly 1 row found
- Row details: name = Christian López (GUA), bodyweight = 104.70, snatch = 153.0, clean & jerk = 182.0, total (kg) = 335.0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, bodyweight, snatch, "clean & jerk", "total (kg)" 
FROM public.weightlifting_at_the_2007_pan_american_games 
WHERE bodyweight = 104.70 AND snatch ~ '^[0-9.]+'$ AND snatch::double precision = 153.0;

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one person with a snatch of 153.0, and that person’s bodyweight is 104.70.

Assumptions/Notes
- “Total bodyweight” is interpreted as the bodyweight field, not the “total (kg)” (which represents total lifted weight). 104.70 is treated as equal to 104.7 due to standard numeric equality.
- “Only 1 person” is evaluated within this specific dataset (weightlifting at the 2007 Pan American Games).
