Claim to verify: During the 1993 New York Jets season, the Jets played 8 games at the game site named Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium.

Data source discovery:
- Available database contains table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season with columns including a stadium field labeled "game site".

Schema evidence (columns):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 't_1993_new_york_jets_season';
- Result: Columns are week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), game site (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence 1: Count of games by game site
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "game site", COUNT(*) AS game_count 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  GROUP BY "game site";
- Result summary:
  - The Meadowlands: 8 games
  - Giants Stadium: 1 game
  - Rich Stadium: 1 game
  - Houston Astrodome: 1 game
  - Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium: 1 game
  - RCA Dome: 1 game
  - Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum: 1 game
  - Foxboro Stadium: 1 game
  - Joe Robbie Stadium: 1 game
- Key point: Only 1 game is recorded at Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium.

Evidence 2: Details of games at Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site" 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE lower("game site") = lower('Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium');
- Result:
  - Week: 15; Date: 1993-12-11; Opponent: Washington Redskins; Result: W 3-0; Game Site: Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium.

Evidence 3: Total games recorded for the season
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
- Result: 16 games total.

Conclusion:
- The data show exactly 1 game at Robert F Kennedy Memorial Stadium during the 1993 New York Jets season, not 8. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “New York Jet” refers to the NFL team New York Jets.
- The 1993 season data in public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season covers the regular season schedule and associated stadium names.
- Matching for stadium name used a case-insensitive exact match on the “game site” field.
- The presence of both “The Meadowlands” and “Giants Stadium” reflects naming variations for Jets home games and does not impact the count for RFK Stadium.
