Conclusion: Verified. In 2003, Amy Sherman-Palladino directed exactly one Gilmore Girls episode: “Ballrooms and Biscotti,” which originally aired on September 23, 2003.

Key evidence from the data:
1) Identify all 2003 episodes and their directors (to see if her name appears and how many times in that year)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count, title, director
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE substring("original air date" from '([0-9]{4})$') = '2003' 
GROUP BY title, director;
Result (excerpt relevant to Amy Sherman‑Palladino):
- Ballrooms and Biscotti — Director: Amy Sherman - Palladino (1 occurrence among 2003 episodes)
Note: The full result returned 9 episodes for 2003; only one lists Amy Sherman‑Palladino as director.

2) Precisely filter for Amy Sherman‑Palladino as director in 2003
Executed SQL (details):
SELECT title, director, "original air date" 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy%Sherman%Palladino%' 
  AND substring("original air date" from '([0-9]{4})$') = '2003';
Result:
- Title: Ballrooms and Biscotti | Director: Amy Sherman‑Palladino | Original Air Date: September 23, 2003

Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy%Sherman%Palladino%' 
  AND substring("original air date" from '([0-9]{4})$') = '2003';
Result: 1

Notes on data formatting:
- The director’s name appears in the dataset with minor formatting variation (e.g., “Amy Sherman - Palladino” vs. “Amy Sherman-Palladino”). The ILIKE pattern '%Amy%Sherman%Palladino%' accounts for spacing and hyphenation differences.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to Gilmore Girls episodes and uses the original U.S. air date year (2003) to define the timeframe.
- “Directed” means credited as the episode’s director in the dataset.
