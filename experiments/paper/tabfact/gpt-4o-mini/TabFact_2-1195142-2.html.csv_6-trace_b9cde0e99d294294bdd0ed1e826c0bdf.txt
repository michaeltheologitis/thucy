Claim evaluated: “The 2005 nominee for Best Costume Design won the award.”

Data source and scope: The available authoritative data consists of a single table (public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical) cataloging awards for the musical La Cage aux Folles, with fields: year, award, category, nominee, result. I searched specifically for 2005 entries where the category mentions “Costume.”

Evidence found:
- Award: Tony Award | Category: Best Costume Design | Nominee: William Ivey Long | Result: Nominated
- Award: Drama Desk Award | Category: Outstanding Costume Design | Nominee: William Ivey Long | Result: Nominated

Exact SQL executed (from the tool):
SELECT award, category, nominee, result 
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical 
WHERE year = 2005 AND category ILIKE '%Costume%';

Conclusion: In the 2005 records available for La Cage aux Folles, the nominee(s) for Best/Outstanding Costume Design were nominated but did not win. Therefore, the claim that the 2005 nominee “won the award” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the query as referring to awards data available in the connected database, which is specific to La Cage aux Folles. If the intended context was another award body (e.g., Academy Awards), such data is not present in the available source; conclusions are strictly based on the accessible dataset.
