Claim to verify: “the result be 3 - 2 at the same time the score be 2 - 0.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, schema public, table: kwak_tae_hwi(date text, venue text, score text, result text, competition text).

Schema exploration sample (to understand columns):
- SQL: SELECT date, venue, score, result FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi LIMIT 20;
  Observation: The table records match-level entries with both a score and a result. From samples, “result” appears to be the final score; “score” appears to be an in-match score (often halftime) or interim score.

Direct tests of the claim:
1) Existence of any match with result = '3 - 2' AND score = '2 - 0'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, venue, competition FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2' AND score = '2 - 0';
- Result: 0 rows (no such match).

2) Counts for context
- Matches with result = '3 - 2'
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2';
  Result: 1
- Matches with score = '2 - 0'
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '2 - 0';
  Result: 1
- Matches with both conditions
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2' AND score = '2 - 0';
  Result: 0

3) Inspect the specific rows for each condition
- Where result = '3 - 2'
  SQL: SELECT date, venue, competition, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE result = '3 - 2';
  Result row: Date: February 17, 2008; Venue: Chongqing, China; Competition: 2008 East Asian Cup; Score: 3 - 2; Result: 3 - 2.
- Where score = '2 - 0'
  SQL: SELECT date, venue, competition, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '2 - 0';
  Result row: Date: March 3, 2010; Venue: London, England; Competition: Friendly; Score: 2 - 0; Result: 2 - 0.

Conclusion:
- In the available data, there is no instance where a match simultaneously has result = 3 - 2 and score = 2 - 0. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Result” is interpreted as the final score; “score” as the in-match (often halftime) score recorded in the same match row.
- “At the same time” is interpreted as within the same match record, not across different matches or time points.
