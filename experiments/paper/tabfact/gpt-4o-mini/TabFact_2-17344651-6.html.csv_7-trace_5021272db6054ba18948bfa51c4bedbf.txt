Claim to verify: “Less than half the 1984–1985 season games were played in the Boston Garden.”

Step 1 — Discover available data
- Finding: A single relevant table exists in the public schema that appears to cover the Boston Celtics’ 1984–85 season.
- SQL (list public tables):
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season

Step 2 — Inspect table structure
- SQL (list columns for candidate tables):
  SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name ILIKE '%celtics%' OR table_name ILIKE '%boston%' OR table_name ILIKE '%nba%' OR table_name ILIKE '%season%' OR table_name LIKE '%1984%' OR table_name LIKE '%1985%';
- Result (columns for public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season):
  - game (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)
  - location (text)
  - record (text)

Step 3 — Count total games and games at Boston Garden
- SQL (total games):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: 14

- SQL (games at Boston Garden):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS garden_games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE LOWER(location) LIKE '%boston garden%';
- Result: 8

- SQL (distinct locations and counts for context):
  SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS location_count FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season GROUP BY location;
- Result:
  - boston garden: 8
  - the omni: 1
  - hartford civic center: 1
  - brendan byrne arena: 1
  - market square arena: 1
  - madison square garden: 1
  - the spectrum: 1

- Calculation (share of games at Boston Garden): 8 / 14 ≈ 57.14%

Conclusion
- The available season table shows that approximately 57.14% of the listed 1984–85 games were played at Boston Garden. This is more than half, not less. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Season games” refers to the games listed in public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season.
- The “location” field accurately reflects the game venue; case-insensitive matching reliably identifies “Boston Garden.”
- No other season tables for 1984–85 exist in the accessible data beyond the identified one, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
