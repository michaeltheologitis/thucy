Claim interpreted: The New York Jets played the Denver Broncos before they played the Miami Dolphins during the 1993 NFL season.

Data source discovery and structure:
- Available dataset: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season (1993 New York Jets season data)
- Table columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), game site (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence from data (games vs Broncos and Dolphins, ordered by week):
- Week 1 — Date: 1993-09-05 — Opponent: denver broncos — Result: l 26-20
- Week 2 — Date: 1993-09-12 — Opponent: miami dolphins — Result: w 24-14
- Week 10 — Date: 1993-11-07 — Opponent: miami dolphins — Result: w 27-10

Executed SQL query (that produced the above evidence):
SELECT week, date, opponent, result 
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%broncos%' OR LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%dolphins%' 
ORDER BY week;

Assessment:
- The Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1, and the Miami Dolphins in Weeks 2 and 10. Therefore, they did play Denver before Miami during the 1993 season.

Assumptions made:
- “new york jet” refers to the NFL team New York Jets.
- “denver bronco” refers to the Denver Broncos.
- “before” is taken to mean earlier in the 1993 regular season schedule (by week/date).
