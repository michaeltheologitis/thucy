Evidence gathered:
- The row for pick 27 lists player Joe Germanese, selected by New England Revolution, position Midfielder (M), affiliation Duke Cary Railhawks U23's.
- A direct lookup by player name also returns a single row with pick 27 and the same details.

SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_mls_superdraft WHERE pick = 27;

2) Lookup by player name 'Joe Germanese':
