Summary of approach
- I first discovered the available data sources.
- I inspected the schema and sampled the data in the only relevant table found.
- I queried the table to see whether it contained final standings and whether any rows reflected under-par finishing totals.

Data source discovery
Tool: functions.discover_data_sources
Result: A PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table public.t_1981_open_championship.

Schema and sample data
Tool: functions.nl_query_traceable
Executed SQL (columns):
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_1981_open_championship';
Result columns:
- score (bigint)
- place (text)
- player (text)
- country (text)
- to par (text)

Executed SQL (keys):
SELECT constraint_type, column_name 
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name 
WHERE tc.table_name = 't_1981_open_championship';
Result: No primary/foreign keys found.

Executed SQL (sample rows):
SELECT * 
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship 
LIMIT 10;
Sample rows returned (abbrev.):
- t1: Nick Job, 70, e
- t1: Vicente Fernández, 70, e
- t3: Isao Aoki, 71, + 1
- t3: David Graham, 71, + 1
- t3: Tony Jacklin, 71, + 1
- t3: Johnny Miller, 71, + 1
- t3: Simon Owen, 71, + 1
- t3: Hal Sutton (A), 71, + 1
- t9: multiple players at 72, + 2

Follow-up queries to assess what the table represents
Tool: functions.nl_query_traceable
Executed SQL (distinct places):
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place;
Result: t1, t3, t9

Executed SQL (top positions rows):
SELECT place, player, score, "to par" 
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship 
WHERE place IN ('1','2','3','t1','t2','t3') 
ORDER BY CASE WHEN place LIKE 't%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END, place, player;
Result: Only t1 and t3 rows (no final placements like 1, 2, 3). All scores are single-round-like (e.g., 70, 71) and to-par values are e, + 1, + 2.

Executed SQL (under-par count across the dataset):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS under_par_rows 
FROM public.t_1981_open_championship 
WHERE "to par" LIKE '- %';
Result: 0 under-par rows in the dataset.

Interpretation
- The table appears to contain a partial leaderboard (likely first-round results) with positions t1, t3, t9 and per-round scores like 70, 71, 72. There are no rows representing final tournament standings (no plain numeric places such as 1, 2, 3; no total scores; and no negative to-par values across the dataset).
- Because the data source does not include final standings, it does not provide evidence to verify the claim about who finished under par for the entire 1981 Open Championship.

Conclusion
- The available data does not support the claim that “in the 1981 Open Championship no player finished under par except Isao Aoki.” The dataset only covers partial/round data with no under-par entries at all and lacks final results. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by the evidence accessible here.

Assumptions
- “Finish under par” is interpreted as finishing the tournament with an aggregate score below par (final standings), not a single-round result.
- “1981 Open Championship” refers to The Open Championship (British Open) held in 1981.
