Summary of finding
- The available data source contains one table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement with 6 rows covering traditional Chinese mass units.
- Only one entry in this table has a metric value expressed in kilograms (kg): the character listed as “担 / 擔,” whose metric equivalent is 60.478982 kg.
- Therefore, the claim that 担/擔 is “1 of 3” characters with a metric value measured in kg is not supported by this dataset. In this dataset, it is the only such character.

Key evidence from the database
1) Which characters have metric values expressed in kg
- Result: 1 distinct character has a metric value with “kg,” namely 担 / 擔 (60.478982 kg).
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT character, "metric value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE "metric value" LIKE '%kg%';

2) Full row for 担 / 擔
- Confirms metric value: 60.478982 kg, relative value: 100 (i.e., 100 斤 in this dataset), imperial value ~133.3333 lb.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character = '担 / 擔';

3) Coverage of the table (to check if more rows might include kg)
- The table contains 6 total rows with the following distinct characters: 兩, 斤, 分, 厘, 担 / 擔, 錢.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement;
SELECT DISTINCT character FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement;

Additional context from sample values
- Sample metric values illustrate that other units are recorded in mg or g (e.g., 厘 ≈ 37.79931 mg; 兩 ≈ 37.79936375 g; 斤 ≈ 604.78982 g), while only 担 / 擔 is recorded in kg (60.478982 kg) in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The part that 担/擔 has a metric value measured in kg is supported.
- The specific claim that it is “1 of 3” such characters is contradicted by the data; only one character shows a metric value in kg in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Have a metric value measure in kg” is interpreted as rows where the "metric value" field explicitly contains “kg.”
- The public.chinese_units_of_measurement table fully represents the relevant traditional units within this data source.
