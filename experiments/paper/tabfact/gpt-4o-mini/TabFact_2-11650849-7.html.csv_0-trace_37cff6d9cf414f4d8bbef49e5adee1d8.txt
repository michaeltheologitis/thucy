Claim to verify: "on sunday , september 30 , the chicago bear beat the green bay packer 31 - 20"

Data source exploration:
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public and a table named bears_packers_rivalry.
- Table bears_packers_rivalry columns: year (bigint), date (text), winner (text), result (text), loser (text), attendance (bigint), location (text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Searched for any rivalry games with a result that includes 31 and 20.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser, location 
  FROM bears_packers_rivalry 
  WHERE result ILIKE '%31%' AND result ILIKE '%20%';
- Result:
  Year: 1951; Date: Sunday, September 30; Winner: Chicago Bears; Result: 31 - 20; Loser: Green Bay Packers; Location: Green Bay.

2) More targeted check for the specific date and score.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser, location 
  FROM bears_packers_rivalry 
  WHERE date ILIKE '%September 30%' AND result = '31 - 20';
- Result:
  Year: 1951; Date: Sunday, September 30; Winner: Chicago Bears; Result: 31 - 20; Loser: Green Bay Packers; Location: Green Bay.

Conclusion:
- The database records a game on Sunday, September 30, 1951, in which the Chicago Bears beat the Green Bay Packers 31-20 in Green Bay. This matches all elements of the claim: day-of-week (Sunday), date (September 30), teams (Bears over Packers), and score (31-20).

Assumptions made:
- The claim did not specify a year; verification interprets it as asserting the existence of such a game on a Sunday, September 30, at any time in the rivalry history. Minor singular/plural spelling differences (bear/packer) are treated as referring to the Chicago Bears and Green Bay Packers.
