Summary
- I verified the claim by querying the authoritative database table public.members_of_the_5th_seanad, which records how many members came from each source (panels, universities, Taoiseach nominations) broken down by party, and can be summed to get overall totals per source.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total members from the Administrative Panel and from the National University of Ireland, and their difference
SQL:
SELECT SUM("administrative panel") AS total_admin_panel FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result: 12

SQL:
SELECT SUM("national university of ireland") AS total_nui FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result: 6

SQL:
SELECT (SUM("administrative panel") - SUM("national university of ireland")) AS difference FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result: 6

2) Contextual totals across all sources (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT SUM("administrative panel") AS total_administrative_panel,
       SUM("agricultural panel") AS total_agricultural_panel,
       SUM("cultural and educational panel") AS total_cultural_and_educational_panel,
       SUM("industrial and commercial panel") AS total_industrial_and_commercial_panel,
       SUM("labour panel") AS total_labour_panel,
       SUM("national university of ireland") AS total_national_university_of_ireland,
       SUM("university of dublin") AS total_university_of_dublin,
       SUM("nominated by the taoiseach") AS total_nominated_by_the_taoiseach,
       SUM(total) AS grand_total
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Results: Administrative Panel=12; Agricultural Panel=21; Cultural and Educational Panel=9; Industrial and Commercial Panel=16; Labour Panel=17; National University of Ireland=6; University of Dublin=6; Nominated by the Taoiseach=23; Grand Total (sum of party totals)=110

Conclusion
- According to the data, Administrative Panel total members = 12 and National University of Ireland total members = 6. The difference is 6, not 4. Therefore, the claim that the Administrative Panel has 4 more members than the National University of Ireland is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Administrative panel” and “National University of Ireland” refer to the columns named exactly "administrative panel" and "national university of ireland" in public.members_of_the_5th_seanad.
- “Member” refers to the counts represented in these columns, summed across all parties in the 5th Seanad dataset.
