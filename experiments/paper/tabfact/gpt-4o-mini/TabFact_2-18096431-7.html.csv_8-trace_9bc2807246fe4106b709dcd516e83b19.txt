Claim interpreted: “Frank Nobilo is the only player from Zimbabwe.” Context: We verify this against the available 1996 PGA Championship dataset.

Evidence from data
1) Country distribution in the 1996 PGA Championship table
- Finding: Zimbabwe appears with 1 player; New Zealand appears with 1 player (among others). This shows that there is exactly one Zimbabwean in the dataset, and exactly one New Zealander.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count
  FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
  GROUP BY country;
- Reported result excerpt:
  - Zimbabwe: 1 player
  - New Zealand: 1 player

2) Player listings by place (top of field) showing each player’s country
- Finding: Frank Nobilo is listed as New Zealand; Nick Price is listed as Zimbabwe.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY place LIMIT 100;
- Reported result excerpt (relevant rows):
  - Frank Nobilo — T8 — New Zealand
  - Nick Price — T8 — Zimbabwe

Assessment
- The data shows Frank Nobilo’s country as New Zealand, not Zimbabwe.
- The dataset shows one Zimbabwean player, Nick Price—not Frank Nobilo.
- Therefore, the claim that “Frank Nobilo [is] the only player from Zimbabwe” is contradicted by the data on two counts: Nobilo is not Zimbabwean, and the sole Zimbabwean (in this dataset) is Nick Price.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate based on the authoritative data available.

Assumptions
- Because the accessible data source pertains to the 1996 PGA Championship, the claim is evaluated within this context. Even outside this dataset, Frank Nobilo is known to be from New Zealand, but our conclusion is strictly grounded in the provided database evidence.
