Claim interpreted: “There is 1 game on May 20 in Houston.” Within the available data (Texas Rangers 2005 season), this would mean the Rangers played exactly one game on May 20 in Houston.

Data sources explored
- Available database/tables: A single PostgreSQL table t_2005_texas_rangers_season (Texas Rangers, 2005 season).

Schema confirmation (via SQL)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_2005_texas_rangers_season';
- Result (abridged):
  attendance (bigint), winning team (text), score (text), date (text), losing pitcher (text), location (text), winning pitcher (text)

Date format check (to query accurately)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 10;
- Sample results:
  May 20; May 21; May 22; June 24; June 25 (dates stored as month-name + day, no year)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Direct check: Count games on May 20 in Houston
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date = 'may 20' AND location ILIKE '%Houston%';
- Result: 0 rows (no game on May 20 in Houston)

2) Cross-check: List all games in Houston
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, location, score 
  FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
  WHERE location ILIKE '%Houston%' 
  ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  - Date: June 24, Location: Houston, Score: 5 - 2
  - Date: June 25, Location: Houston, Score: 6 - 5
  (No May 20 entry appears for Houston.)

3) Cross-check: What happened on May 20?
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, location, score FROM t_2005_texas_rangers_season WHERE date = 'may 20';
- Result:
  - Date: May 20, Location: Arlington, Score: 7 - 3
  (The Rangers played on May 20, but in Arlington, not Houston.)

Conclusion
- The data shows zero games on May 20 in Houston for the Texas Rangers 2005 season. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Texas Rangers 2005 season (the only available dataset).
- “May 20” refers to the date format used in the table (e.g., 'may 20').
- “Houston” refers to the city as recorded in the location column.
