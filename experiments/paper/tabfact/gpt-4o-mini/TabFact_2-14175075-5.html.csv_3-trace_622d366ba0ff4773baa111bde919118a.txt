Claim interpreted: "w gymnastics be the sport with the earliest date in 2008" is taken to mean: In the available sports events dataset for 2008, the earliest dated event belongs to women's gymnastics.

Data sources explored:
- Identified relevant dataset via schema exploration: Database TabFact, table iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series with columns sport (TEXT) and date (TEXT).

Evidence and results:
1) Earliest 2008 event and its sport
- Result: Earliest event date in 2008 is February 22, 2008, associated with women's gymnastics.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY')) AS earliest_date, sport 
FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
WHERE TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY'), 'YYYY') = '2008'
GROUP BY sport 
ORDER BY earliest_date ASC 
LIMIT 1;

2) Full listing of 2008 events ordered by date (for verification)
- Result rows (ordered ascending by date):
  1. sport: women's gymnastics, date: February 22, 2008
  2. sport: women's gymnastics, date: March 7, 2008
  3. sport: softball, date: April 1, 2008
- Executed SQL:
SELECT sport, date 
FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
WHERE TO_CHAR(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY'), 'YYYY') = '2008' 
ORDER BY TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY') ASC;

Assessment:
- The earliest dated event in 2008 in this dataset is February 22, 2008, and it is for women's gymnastics. Therefore, the claim that women's gymnastics is the sport with the earliest date in 2008 is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "w gymnastics" is interpreted as women's gymnastics.
- The universe of events considered is limited to the TabFact.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series table.
- Dates in the date column follow a format parseable by TO_DATE with the pattern 'Month DD, YYYY'.
