Conclusion: Supported by the data. In the available 1954 VFL season dataset, there is one match where Essendon is the away team, and its recorded crowd is 28,158.

Evidence 1 — List the Essendon away match and its crowd
- SQL: SELECT "home team", "away team", "date", "venue", "crowd"
        FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
        WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%Essendon%';
- Result row:
  - Home team: Geelong; Away team: Essendon; Date: 31 July 1954; Venue: Kardinia Park; Crowd: 28,158

Evidence 2 — Count Essendon-away matches and compute average crowd
- SQL (count): SELECT COUNT(*) as match_count 
        FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
        WHERE LOWER("away team") LIKE '%essendon%';
- Result: match_count = 1

- SQL (average crowd): SELECT AVG(crowd) as average_crowd 
        FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
        WHERE LOWER("away team") LIKE '%essendon%';
- Result: average_crowd = 28158

- SQL (list crowds): SELECT crowd 
        FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
        WHERE LOWER("away team") LIKE '%essendon%';
- Result: 28158
