Claim to verify: "the highest attendance be 20066 , occur on 6 date"

Data source explored
- Database: public schema
- Table: t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) What is the maximum attendance?
SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
Result: 20,066

2) On which dates did the maximum attendance occur, and how many such dates are there?
SQL (list dates):
SELECT date FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);
Resulting dates: January 3, January 5, January 7, January 14, January 16, January 29, January 31

SQL (count games with max attendance):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);
Result: 7 games

SQL (count distinct dates with max attendance):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_date_count
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season);
Result: 7 distinct dates

3) Full context for the max-attendance rows
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, attendance 
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season 
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season) 
ORDER BY date;
Rows:
- January 3 — Anaheim at Detroit — 20,066
- January 5 — Nashville at Detroit — 20,066
- January 7 — Boston at Detroit — 20,066
- January 14 — Chicago at Detroit — 20,066
- January 16 — Phoenix at Detroit — 20,066
- January 29 — New Jersey at Detroit — 20,066
- January 31 — Carolina at Detroit — 20,066

Conclusion
- True: The highest attendance is 20,066.
- False: It occurred on 6 dates. The data show it occurred on 7 distinct dates.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the connected dataset (Detroit Red Wings 2003–04 season) and that “occur on 6 date” means “occurred on six distinct dates.”
