Claim to verify: “the export for the country of sud - vest oltenia be 26557.8”.

Data source discovery
- Available source: public PostgreSQL database, table public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (trusted per instructions).
- Relevant fields: county (text), exports (us mil) (text), percent of total exports (text), imports (us mil) (text), percent of total imports (text). Units for exports/imports are millions of USD.

Evidence from queries
1) Retrieve the exports value for Sud-Vest Oltenia (allowing common naming variations)
SQL:
SELECT county, "exports (us mil)" 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE county ILIKE '%Sud-Vest Oltenia%' 
   OR county ILIKE '%Sud - Vest Oltenia%'
   OR county ILIKE '%South-West Oltenia%';
Result: exports (us mil) = 3226.2 for the Sud‑Vest Oltenia region.

2) List any rows containing tokens for the region name and show exports/imports to explicitly surface the matching row
SQL:
SELECT county, "exports (us mil)" AS exports, "imports (us mil)" AS imports 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE county ILIKE '%sud%' OR county ILIKE '%vest%' OR county ILIKE '%oltenia%';
Excerpt of result including the target row:
- county: sud - vest oltenia | exports: 3,226.2 | imports: 2,007.8 (all in million USD)

3) Check if the figure 26557.8 appears anywhere as an exports or imports value
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE "exports (us mil)" = '26557.8' OR "exports (us mil)" = '26557' OR "exports (us mil)" = '26,557.8' OR "exports (us mil)" = '26,557' 
   OR "imports (us mil)" = '26557.8' OR "imports (us mil)" = '26557' OR "imports (us mil)" = '26,557.8' OR "imports (us mil)" = '26,557';
Result: 0 rows match. The value 26,557.8 does not exist in the dataset for exports or imports for any row.

4) Cross-check if 26,557.8 might be a total across all entries
SQL:
SELECT SUM(REPLACE(REPLACE("exports (us mil)", ',', ''), ' ', '')::numeric) AS total_exports
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade;
Result: total_exports = 96,331.2 million USD, not 26,557.8.

Conclusion
- The exports value for Sud‑Vest Oltenia in the available dataset is 3,226.2 million USD. The claimed figure 26,557.8 is not present for that region (or anywhere else in the table) and does not match the total either. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “export” refers to the column exports (us mil) in this dataset.
- “country of sud - vest oltenia” refers to the Romanian development region commonly named Sud‑Vest Oltenia (South-West Oltenia) as represented in the county field.
- Units are millions of USD; the dataset’s reference year is not specified and is taken as-is from the table.
