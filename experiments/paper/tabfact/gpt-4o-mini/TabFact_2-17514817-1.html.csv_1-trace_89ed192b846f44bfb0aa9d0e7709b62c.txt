Conclusion: Verified. Data shows Dr Hexter's Healer from West Berkshire Brewery won three gold medals between 1995 and 2009 (inclusive).

What I checked
- Explored the available data source and identified a single table containing West Berkshire Brewery awards data.
- Queried for entries related to “Dr Hexter’s Healer” and counted gold medals within 1995–2009.

Data source and structure
- Database schema: public
- Table: public.west_berkshire_brewery
- Columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)

Evidence from the database
1) Exploration of all relevant entries (to see available records for the beer):
SQL:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition 
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery 
WHERE "beer name" ILIKE '%hexter%' OR "beer name" ILIKE '%healer%'
Results (filtered to the Healer beer):
- 2008 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | in category | camra london and south east regional competition
(Other non-gold/non-Healer entries also exist, e.g., runner up in 1997 and silver in 2002; “dr hexter’s wedding ale” in 2005 is a different beer.)

2) Attempted exact-match count (returned zero due to exact case/formatting not matching stored values). Shown here for completeness:
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS medal_count
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 AND prize = 'Gold Medal' AND "beer name" = 'Dr Hexter''s Healer';
SQL (list):
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 AND prize = 'Gold Medal' AND "beer name" = 'Dr Hexter''s Healer';
Result: 0 rows (due to capitalization and spacing in stored text)

3) Case-insensitive, substring-based verification query (authoritative for the claim):
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_gold_medals
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE "beer name" ILIKE '%healer%'
AND prize ILIKE '%gold%'
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;
Result: 3

SQL (list rows):
SELECT *
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE "beer name" ILIKE '%healer%'
AND prize ILIKE '%gold%'
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;
Returned rows:
- 2008 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | in category | camra london and south east regional competition

Interpretation
- The data lists exactly three gold medal awards for Dr Hexter’s Healer within 1995–2009.

Assumptions
- “Between 1995 and 2009” is interpreted inclusively (1995 ≤ year ≤ 2009).
- “Dr Hexter Healer” refers to the beer recorded as “dr hexter 's healer” in the dataset; case and punctuation normalized via ILIKE matching.
