Summary conclusion: Yes. According to the Indianapolis Colts draft history data, Curtis Dickey was drafted in Round 1 (overall 5), while Randy Bielski was drafted in Round 12 (overall 311). Therefore, Curtis Dickey was picked in an earlier round than Randy Bielski.

Data source explored:
- Database domain: Indianapolis Colts draft history
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
- Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
- Purpose: Retrieve the draft round and overall pick for Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, round, overall FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE 'Curtis Dickey' OR name ILIKE 'Randy Bielski%' OR name ILIKE 'Randy Beisler%';
- Results returned:
  - Curtis Dickey — Round: 1, Overall: 5
  - Randy Bielski — Round: 12, Overall: 311

Interpretation:
- Earlier round means a smaller round number. Since 1 < 12, Curtis Dickey was drafted earlier than Randy Bielski.

Assumptions:
- The phrase “be pick during an earlier round” is interpreted as “was drafted in an earlier numerically lower round.”
- Verification is based on the Indianapolis/Baltimore Colts franchise draft history contained in the available database.
- The name “Randy Bielski” is taken as-is from the database record matched by the query; a secondary wildcard for “Randy Beisler” was included to guard against potential spelling variance, but the result used was the explicit “Randy Bielski” match.
