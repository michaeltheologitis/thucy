Claim interpreted: A drop ride with a 272-foot drop height was open before March 22, 2003.

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database (public schema) with one table: drop_tower_scream_zone.

Schema inspection
- Table: drop_tower_scream_zone
  - Columns (all text): park, "tower height", "drop height", speed, model, opened, "height requirement"
  - Date-related field: opened (stored as text but represents a date)
  - Tool used: Schema exploration tool

Evidence from data
1) Full table contents
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone;
- Returned rows include (relevant excerpt):
  - Kings Dominion | tower height: 305 feet | drop height: 272 feet | speed: 72 mph | model: Gyro Drop | opened: March 22, 2003 | height requirement: inches (cm)

2) Locate the ride with 272-foot drop and parse its opening date
- SQL executed:
  SELECT park, "drop height", opened, to_date(opened, 'Month DD, YYYY') AS opened_date 
  FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone 
  WHERE "drop height" ILIKE '272%';
- Result:
  - Park: Kings Dominion
  - Drop Height: 272 feet
  - Opened (text): March 22, 2003
  - Opened (parsed): 2003-03-22

3) Reconfirm the opening date for the 272-foot entry
- SQL executed:
  SELECT opened 
  FROM public.drop_tower_scream_zone 
  WHERE "drop height" LIKE '272%';
- Result: March 22, 2003

Analysis
- The only entry with a 272-foot drop height is at Kings Dominion.
- Its opening date is March 22, 2003, not before that date.

Conclusion
- The claim that the 272-foot drop ride was open before March 22, 2003 is contradicted by the data. The ride opened on March 22, 2003.

Assumptions
- "drop height of 272 foot" refers to the ride entry with "drop height" = 272 feet in the provided data (Kings Dominion).
- "be open before" is interpreted as the ride’s official opening date being earlier than March 22, 2003.
- The database is authoritative for this verification task.
