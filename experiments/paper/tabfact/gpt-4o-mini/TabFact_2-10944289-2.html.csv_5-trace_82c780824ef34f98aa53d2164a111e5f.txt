Claim to verify: “the dallas cowboy and the seattle seahawks play at the qwest field on december 31 , and the cowboy lead in a final score of 20 - 9”

What the data shows
1) Did the Cowboys and Seahawks play at Qwest Field (NBC primetime dataset)?
- Yes, but on January 6, not December 31, and the final score was 21-20 (Seahawks), not 20-9.

Executed SQL and results:
- Game(s) between Cowboys and Seahawks (any date):
  SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score" 
  FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present 
  WHERE ("visiting team" ILIKE '%Cowboys%' AND "host team" ILIKE '%Seahawks%') 
     OR ("visiting team" ILIKE '%Seahawks%' AND "host team" ILIKE '%Cowboys%') ;
  Result:
  - Date: January 6; Visiting Team: Dallas Cowboys; Host Team: Seattle Seahawks; Stadium: Qwest Field; Final Score: 20 - 21

- Any games on December 31 in this dataset:
  SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score" 
  FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present 
  WHERE date ILIKE '%December 31%';
  Result:
  - Date: December 31; Visiting Team: Green Bay Packers; Host Team: Chicago Bears; Stadium: Soldier Field; Final Score: 26 - 7

- Any games at Qwest Field in this dataset:
  SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "host team", stadium, "final score" FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Qwest%';
  Result:
  - Date: January 6; Visiting Team: Dallas Cowboys; Host Team: Seattle Seahawks; Stadium: Qwest Field; Final Score: 20 - 21

- Any game with a final score of 20-9:
  SQL:
  SELECT date, "visiting team", "final score", "host team", stadium 
  FROM public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present 
  WHERE "final score" ILIKE '%20 - 9%' OR "final score" ILIKE '%20-9%';
  Result: No rows returned

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “play at the qwest field”: Supported in this dataset, but on January 6 (Cowboys at Seahawks, Qwest Field), not December 31.
- “on december 31”: Not supported. The only December 31 entry is Packers at Bears at Soldier Field.
- “final score of 20 - 9” with the Cowboys leading: Not supported. No 20-9 game exists in the dataset; the Cowboys-Seahawks Qwest Field game finished 21-20 in favor of Seattle.

Conclusion: The available data contradicts the date and score asserted in the claim. While a Cowboys–Seahawks game at Qwest Field did occur, it was on January 6 and ended 21–20 for the Seahawks, not 20–9 for the Cowboys on December 31.

Assumptions
- The verification is based on the accessible, authoritative dataset: public.nbc_sunday_night_football_results_2006_present, which includes NBC Sunday Night Football (and NBC primetime playoff) games from 2006 onward. Within this scope, there is no record matching the claim’s date and score.
