Summary
- I explored the available data source and found a single accessible table: public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc. I examined its structure and then queried for leaders from the state of jin, their titles, and specifically whether any jin records have the title duke.

Findings and Evidence
1) Table structure (to understand available fields)
SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc';
Result: Columns are state (text), type (text), name (text), title (text), royal house (text), from (text).

2) Which states are present (to verify the presence and casing of 'jin')
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT state FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc;
Result: cai, chen, lu, yan, chu, wey, qi, cao, song, qin, jin.

3) All records for state = 'jin' (to see the names and titles actually recorded)
SQL: SELECT name, title, type, "royal house", "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'jin';
Result:
- name: xi; title: marquis; type: sovereign; royal house: ji; from: 840 bc
- name: xian; title: marquis; type: sovereign; royal house: ji; from: 822 bc
Interpretation: For jin in this dataset (covering the 820s BC), the rulers recorded are xi and xian, and their title is marquis, not duke.

4) Distinct titles for state = 'jin' (to confirm there is no 'duke' title for jin)
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT title FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'jin';
Result: marquis only.

5) Where title = 'duke' (to check whether any jin entries exist with title duke)
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT state, name FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE title = 'duke';
Result: duke appears for other states (chen: li; lu: shen, wu; qi: li, wu; qin: zhuang; song: hui) and not for jin.

Conclusion
- In the accessible dataset (leaders in the 820s BC), there are no records where state = jin and title = duke. The names xi and xian are present for jin, but their title is marquis.
- Therefore, the proposition that the name is xi or xian when the state is jin and the title is duke is not supported by the data in this source.

Assumptions
- I interpreted your question as the claim: “When state = jin and title = duke, the ruler’s name is xi or xian.”
- Verification is limited to the available dataset public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc, which focuses on the 820s BC period.
