Data sources explored

Schema inspection
- Columns in the table:
  - opposing team (text)
  - against (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - venue (text)
  - status (text)
- The status field identifies match type (e.g., Tour Match, Test Match). The date field is text (includes day-month-year), and venue contains location names.

Evidence from data
1) Matches at Twickenham/London (showing date, venue, opponent, and type)
- Result rows:
  - Opposing Team: London Counties; Against: 12; Date: 28 October 1978; Venue: Twickenham, London; Status: Tour Match
  - Opposing Team: England; Against: 6; Date: 25 November 1978; Venue: Twickenham, London; Status: Test Match

  SELECT "opposing team", "against", "date", "venue", "status"
  FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  WHERE venue ILIKE '%Twickenham%' OR venue ILIKE '%London%';

Conclusion

This directly supports the claim that a tour match was held in October and a test match was held in November in Twickenham, London.

Assumptions
