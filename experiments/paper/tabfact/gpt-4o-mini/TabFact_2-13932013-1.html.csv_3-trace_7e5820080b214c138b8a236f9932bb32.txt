Claim to verify: "only 10 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have win more than 10 game"

Interpretation: Count the number of Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks whose recorded wins (with the Browns) are strictly greater than 10.

Data source discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
  - Columns: quarterback, uniform no (s), games started, wins, losses, ties, winning pct

Evidence step 1: List all Browns starting quarterbacks with more than 10 wins and their win totals.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT quarterback, wins 
  FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks 
  WHERE wins > 10 
  ORDER BY wins DESC;
- Result (name — wins):
  - Brian Sipe — 57
  - Otto Graham — 57
  - Bernie Kosar — 53
  - Frank Ryan — 52
  - Bill Nelsen — 34
  - Milt Plum — 33
  - Mike Phipps — 24
  - Tim Couch — 22
  - Derek Anderson — 16
  - Vinny Testaverde — 16

Evidence step 2: Count how many such quarterbacks there are.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_of_qbs 
  FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks 
  WHERE wins > 10;
- Result: 10

Conclusion: The data shows exactly 10 Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks have more than 10 wins with the team, matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Cleveland Brown’s quarterback” refers to quarterbacks listed as starting quarterbacks for the Cleveland Browns in the given table.
- “win more than 10 game” means strictly greater than 10 wins (wins > 10) recorded with the Browns.
