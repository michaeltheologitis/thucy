Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters (columns include: animal name, species, books, tv series, gender, tv seasons, mate, first appearance, last appearance)

Step-by-step verification and evidence
1) Initial direct lookup by exact names (no results, so broadened search)
SQL executed:
SELECT "animal name", "last appearance" FROM list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters WHERE "animal name" IN ('Paddock', 'Red Squirrel');
Result: No rows returned.

2) Fuzzy search to locate similarly named entries
SQL executed:
SELECT "animal name", species, "last appearance" 
FROM list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters 
WHERE LOWER("animal name") LIKE '%paddock%' OR LOWER("animal name") LIKE '%squirrel%';
Results (relevant rows):
- animal name: paddock | species: toad | last appearance: blood is thicker then water (2x12)
- animal name: red squirrels | species: red squirrel | last appearance: a hero 's welcome (2x01)

3) Confirm exact records for Paddock
SQL executed:
SELECT "animal name", species, "first appearance", "last appearance" 
FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters 
WHERE LOWER("animal name") = LOWER('paddock');
Result:
- animal name: paddock | species: toad | first appearance: home is where the heart is (2x06) | last appearance: blood is thicker then water (2x12)

4) Confirm exact records for Red Squirrels
SQL executed:
SELECT "animal name", species, "first appearance", "last appearance" 
FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters 
WHERE LOWER("animal name") = LOWER('red squirrels');
Result:
- animal name: red squirrels | species: red squirrel | first appearance: a hero 's welcome (2x01) | last appearance: a hero 's welcome (2x01)

Findings
- Paddock: The database records Paddock’s last appearance as “blood is thicker then water (2x12)”. This matches the claimed episode “Blood is Thicker Than Water” aside from a minor spelling difference (“then” vs “than”), which does not change the identification of the episode.
- Red Squirrel(s): The database has an entry for “red squirrels” (plural) with last appearance “a hero’s welcome (2x01)”. This aligns with the claim that Red Squirrel’s last appearance is in “A Hero’s Welcome,” noting the table uses the plural group name.

Conclusion
- Both parts of the claim are supported by the dataset, with only minor spelling/casing/pluralization differences that do not affect the substantive meaning.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to characters from The Animals of Farthing Wood, as per the available dataset.
- “Red squirrel” in the claim refers to the group entry “red squirrels” in the table.
- Minor spelling/punctuation differences in episode titles (then/than, apostrophe spacing) are treated as equivalent to the intended episode names.
