Claim to verify: "Equestrian at the Asian Games happened every 4 years from 1982 to 2010, except for in 1990."

Data source discovery:
- Available database: Asian Games database
- Relevant table: equestrian_at_the_asian_games (columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze)

Evidence collected:
1) Years and locations for equestrian at the Asian Games between 1982 and 2010
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, location FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year BETWEEN 1982 AND 2010 ORDER BY year ASC;
Result:
- 1982 — New Delhi
- 1986 — Seoul
- 1994 — Hiroshima
- 1998 — Bangkok
- 2002 — Busan
- 2006 — Doha
- 2010 — Guangzhou

2) Explicit check for 1990 entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year = 1990;
Result: count = 0 (1990 not present)

Analysis:
- The recorded equestrian editions within 1982–2010 are 1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, and 2010.
- Differences between consecutive years: 1982→1986 (+4), 1986→1994 (+8), 1994→1998 (+4), 1998→2002 (+4), 2002→2006 (+4), 2006→2010 (+4).
- The only deviation from a 4-year cadence is the absence of 1990, which creates the 8-year gap between 1986 and 1994. The explicit count query confirms 1990 does not exist in the dataset.

Conclusion:
- The data supports that equestrian at the Asian Games occurred on a 4-year cycle in the period 1982–2010, with the sole exception that 1990 is missing.

Assumptions:
- “Happen” means equestrian events were contested at those Asian Games editions. Presence of a year in the table indicates the event took place; absence indicates it did not.
