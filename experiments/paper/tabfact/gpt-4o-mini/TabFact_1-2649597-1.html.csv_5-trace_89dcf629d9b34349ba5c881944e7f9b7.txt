Claim: “Shane Hall ran a total of 198 races between 1996 and 2008.”

Conclusion: The available data shows 188 total races between 1996 and 2008 (inclusive), not 198.

Evidence
1) Total races (1996–2008 inclusive)
- Result: 188
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races
  FROM shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1996 AND 2008;

2) Year-by-year breakdown with running total (to validate the sum)
- Results (Year: Races → Running total):
  - 1996: 14 → 14
  - 1997: 28 → 42
  - 1998: 31 → 73
  - 1999: 25 → 98
  - 2000: 2 → 100
  - 2001: 33 → 133
  - 2002: 24 → 157
  - 2003: 5 → 162
  - 2004: 9 → 171
  - 2005: 7 → 178
  - 2006: 9 → 187
  - 2008: 1 → 188
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, races, SUM(races) OVER (ORDER BY year) AS running_total
  FROM shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1996 AND 2008;

Notes and assumptions
- Assumed the ‘races’ column in table shane_hall represents the total number of races Shane Hall ran in each listed year across the competition(s) represented by this dataset.
- The year range was treated as inclusive (1996 through 2008).
