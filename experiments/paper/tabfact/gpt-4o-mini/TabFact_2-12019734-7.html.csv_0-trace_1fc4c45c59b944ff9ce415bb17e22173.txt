Claim interpreted: “New Jersey was the home team in the game on February 3.”

Evidence from the authoritative dataset (TabFact.public.my_info_table):

Result rows for the specified date:
- Row: date = "february 3", visitor = "ny islanders", score = "7 - 2", home = "new jersey", record = "11 - 32 - 11"

Supporting SQL queries executed:
1) List the exact row for February 3
SQL:
SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE date = 'february 3';
Result:
- february 3 | ny islanders | 7 - 2 | new jersey | 11 - 32 - 11

2) Explicitly check if the home team equals 'new jersey'
SQL:
SELECT visitor, home, score, (home = 'new jersey') AS is_home_team FROM my_info_table WHERE date = 'february 3';
Result:
- visitor = ny islanders, home = new jersey, score = 7 - 2, is_home_team = true

Conclusion:
The data shows that on February 3, the game listed had New Jersey as the home team.

Assumptions made:
- The date "february 3" refers to the entry stored as text exactly matching "february 3" in the dataset; no year granularity is provided in the table.
- "New Jersey" refers to the team name appearing in the 'home' column of this dataset.
