Summary
Claim: “Denni Neufeld [is] listed as a second for Winnipeg.”
Finding: The data shows Denni Neufeld is listed as the lead on the Winnipeg-based Mike McEwen team; the second on that team is Matt Wozniak. No entries list Denni Neufeld as second.

Evidence from the database

  SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city 
  FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials 
  WHERE city ILIKE '%Winnipeg%';
- Result excerpt (relevant row):
  Skip: Mike McEwen | Third / Vice Skip: B.J. Neufeld | Second: Matt Wozniak | Lead: Denni Neufeld | City: Winnipeg
  (Other Winnipeg teams also appear, but none list Denni Neufeld as second.)

2) Direct check if Denni Neufeld is listed as second anywhere
- SQL executed:
  SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city 
  FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials 
  WHERE second ILIKE '%Denni%Neufeld%';
- Result: No rows returned.

3) Confirmation of Denni Neufeld’s position (lead) on the Winnipeg team

  Skip: Mike McEwen | Third / Vice Skip: B.J. Neufeld | Second: Matt Wozniak | Lead: Denni Neufeld | City: Winnipeg

Conclusion
Based on the authoritative 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset, Denni Neufeld is not listed as a second for any team from Winnipeg; he is listed as the lead on the Mike McEwen team, with Matt Wozniak as the second.

Assumptions
- “for Winnipeg” refers to teams whose City field contains “Winnipeg” in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset.
- “second” refers to the player position field named “second” in the table.
