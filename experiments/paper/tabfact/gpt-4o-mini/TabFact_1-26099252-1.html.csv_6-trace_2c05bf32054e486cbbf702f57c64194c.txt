Claim to verify (interpreted): For the Android Browser, the latest stable release is “4.2.1 Jelly Bean (November 27, 2012)”, with H.264 at 9.0 and VP9 (WebM) not supported.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: html5_video (contains fields for browser, operating system, latest stable release, and codec support including h264 and “vp9 ( webm )”).

Evidence gathered:
1) Retrieve the Android Browser row and inspect relevant fields
SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "latest stable release", h264, "vp9 ( webm )" 
FROM public.html5_video 
WHERE browser = 'android browser';

Result:
- Browser: android browser
- Operating System: android
- Latest Stable Release: 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012)
- H.264: 3.0
- VP9 (WebM): no

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- “4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012) be the stable version” → Supported by data (matches the “latest stable release” field).
- “h264 be 9.0” → Contradicted by data (the table lists H.264 as 3.0 for Android Browser).
- “vp9 (webm) be no” → Supported by data (the table lists VP9 (WebM) as “no”).

Conclusion: The claim mixes correct and incorrect details. The stable version and VP9 status are correct for Android Browser, but the H.264 value is not 9.0; it is 3.0 according to the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Stable version” refers to the “latest stable release” field in public.html5_video.
- The claim pertains to the “android browser” entry (not Chrome on Android or other browsers).
- “h264 be 9.0” refers to the h264 field value in the table, which appears to encode version/support level, not a codec profile/level outside the table’s own schema.
