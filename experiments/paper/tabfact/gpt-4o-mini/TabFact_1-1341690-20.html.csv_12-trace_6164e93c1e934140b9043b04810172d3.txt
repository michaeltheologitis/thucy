Summary
Claim: “Robert Bauman [is/was] the incumbent for Maryland’s 2nd congressional district.”
Finding: The available authoritative dataset (1974 U.S. House elections) shows the incumbent for Maryland’s 2nd district was Clarence Long, not Robert Bauman. No entries list “Bauman” as an incumbent in that table.

Data Source Discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (historical House election data for 1974).

Schema Inspection
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), “first elected” (bigint), result (text), candidates (text)
  - No primary keys or constraints.

Evidence
1) Identify the incumbent for Maryland’s 2nd district (1974)
- Result: District: “Maryland 2”; Incumbent: “Clarence Long”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974;
(Note: Among the returned rows, the “Maryland 2” record lists “Clarence Long” as incumbent.)

2) Check if any 1974 incumbent entry is “Robert Bauman”
- Result: No rows found.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent = 'Robert Bauman'

3) Broader text search for any incumbent containing “Bauman”
- Result: No rows found.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Bauman%';

Conclusion
The available 1974 election data directly contradicts the claim: for Maryland’s 2nd district, the incumbent listed is Clarence Long, not Robert Bauman. No evidence in this dataset shows Robert Bauman as an incumbent in that district.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible dataset covers the 1974 U.S. House elections, I interpreted the claim with respect to that timeframe. If the claim intended a different year, additional data would be needed, but within the authoritative data available here, the claim is not supported.
