Claim interpreted: “Glasgow Govan is one of the four constituencies with result as ‘SNP gain.’”

Data source explored: A PostgreSQL database with table scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 (public schema), containing constituency-level results and a “result” field indicating outcomes such as gains/holds.

Evidence collected:
1) Identify all constituencies where result indicates an SNP gain (case-insensitive search for both ‘SNP’ and ‘gain’):
SQL executed:
SELECT constituency, result FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE LOWER(result) LIKE '%snp%' AND LOWER(result) LIKE '%gain%';
Result:
- Kilmarnock & Loudoun — SNP gain
- Dundee West — SNP gain
- Western Isles — SNP gain
- Glasgow Govan — SNP gain

2) Count how many constituencies meet this SNP gain criterion:
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE LOWER(result) LIKE '%snp%' AND LOWER(result) LIKE '%gain%';
Result: 4

3) Confirm Glasgow Govan’s specific result entry:
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE constituency ILIKE '%Glasgow Govan%';
Result fields (abridged):
- Constituency: Glasgow Govan
- Result: SNP gain
- Winning Party 2003: Labour
- SNP's place 2003: 2nd
- Swing to Gain: 2.92

Conclusion:
- Glasgow Govan’s result is “SNP gain.”
- There are exactly 4 constituencies in this dataset with an SNP gain.
- Therefore, Glasgow Govan is indeed one of the four constituencies with result as SNP gain.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Scottish Parliament General Election 2007 data (the available authoritative dataset).
