Claim interpreted: Rankin County is home to multiple proposed projects; list them. Within the available authoritative data (Mississippi Superfund site listings), “projects” are interpreted as Superfund sites and “proposed” refers to their Proposed-to-NPL dates.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (Superfund sites in Mississippi)

Relevant schema (as reported by the schema tool):
- Columns: cerclis id (text), name (text), county (text), proposed (text), listed (text), construction completed (text), partially deleted (text), deleted (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Query to find Rankin County entries and their proposed status:
SQL executed:
SELECT name, county, proposed 
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
WHERE county ILIKE '%Rankin%';
Result:
- Flowood Site | County: Rankin | Proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983
- Sonford Products | County: Rankin | Proposed: 09 / 27 / 2006

2) Query to retrieve full details for Rankin County entries:
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE county ILIKE '%Rankin%';
Result summary:
- Flowood Site (CERCLIS ID: msd980710941)
  • County: rankin
  • Proposed: 09 / 08 / 1983
  • Listed: 09 / 21 / 1984
  • Construction Completed: 09 / 17 / 1993
  • Partially Deleted: -
  • Deleted: 02 / 16 / 1996
- Sonford Products (CERCLIS ID: msd086556388)
  • County: rankin
  • Proposed: 09 / 27 / 2006
  • Listed: 03 / 07 / 2007
  • Construction Completed: -
  • Partially Deleted: -
  • Deleted: -

Conclusion:
- The data shows Rankin County has multiple Superfund sites that were proposed (two sites: Flowood Site and Sonford Products). Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “Projects” refers to Superfund sites in the available dataset.
- “Proposed” refers to the “Proposed” field in the table, indicating the date the site was proposed for the National Priorities List (NPL).
