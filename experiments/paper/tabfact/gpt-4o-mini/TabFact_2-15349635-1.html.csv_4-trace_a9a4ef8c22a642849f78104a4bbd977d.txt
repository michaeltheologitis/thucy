Summary
- Interpreted claim: In the available 1940 Brazilian football standings table, there is a three-team tie on points, and those teams are separated by goal difference.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football (Brazilian football, 1940).

Schema inspected
- Columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text).

Evidence 1: Full standings snapshot
- Purpose: Establish the points and goal differences for all teams.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position ASC;
- Result excerpt (relevant rows):
  - 6: botafogo, points 6, difference 0
  - 7: vasco da gama, points 6, difference - 2
  - 8: américa, points 6, difference - 10
  Also shows other teams have different point totals, with only the above three tied on 6 points.

Evidence 2: Identify point totals shared by exactly three teams
- Purpose: Verify there exists a three-team tie on points.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT points, COUNT(*) as team_count
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  GROUP BY points
  HAVING COUNT(*) = 3;
- Result: points = 6 is shared by exactly three teams.

Evidence 3: Confirm separation by goal difference ordering
- Purpose: Show those three teams are ordered by goal difference (best to worst) when tied on points.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT position, team, points, CAST(REPLACE(difference, ' ', '') AS INTEGER) AS goal_difference 
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football 
  WHERE points = 6 
  ORDER BY goal_difference DESC;
- Result (ordered by goal difference descending):
  - Botafogo: position 6, points 6, goal_difference 0
  - Vasco da Gama: position 7, points 6, goal_difference -2
  - América: position 8, points 6, goal_difference -10
  This ordering matches the table positions, confirming separation by goal difference among the tied teams.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one instance where three teams are tied on points (6) and are separated by goal difference, consistent with the claim.

Assumptions
- “Difference” column represents goal difference (GD). Formatting inconsistencies (e.g., spaces in negative values) were normalized for numeric comparison.
- The claim refers to this specific available dataset (1940 Brazilian football standings) rather than an unspecified league or season.
