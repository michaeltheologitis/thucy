Summary of data sources explored
- I discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single user table: public.my_info_table. System schemas (pg_catalog, information_schema) are also present.
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
  - SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;

Table structure and sample data
- I inspected public.my_info_table to understand its columns and contents, then pulled a sample.
- Columns (from information_schema):
  - episode: bigint (nullable)
  - series: bigint (nullable)
  - episode title: text (nullable)
  - original air date: text (nullable)
  - production code: bigint (nullable)
- SQL executed to get column info:
  - SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'my_info_table';
- Sample rows (first 10): show episodes 27–36 with titles such as "return to genesis", "the suspension", etc.
- SQL executed to get sample rows:
  - SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 10;

Tests relevant to the claim
1) Does any episode have the title "the expulsion" (case-insensitive)?
- Result: No rows found.
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE lower("episode title") = 'the expulsion';

2) Is there a record for episode = 1, and if so, what is its title?
- Result: No rows where episode = 1 were found in this dataset.
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episode = 1;

3) If “1 episode” refers to the first episode within a sequence/season (series = 1), what is its title in this dataset?
- Result: The row with series = 1 has title "Return to Genesis" (episode 27, original air date 5 April 2008, production code 201). This indicates that within this table, the first-in-sequence entry present is titled "Return to Genesis", not "The Expulsion".
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "original air date", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE series = 1 ORDER BY episode ASC LIMIT 10;

Conclusion
- The database contains no episode titled "The Expulsion". There is also no record for episode = 1 in this table. The first-in-sequence (series = 1) entry present is titled "Return to Genesis". Therefore, the claim that “1 episode be title the expulsion” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as asserting that either (a) the record with episode = 1 is titled "The Expulsion", or (b) the first episode in sequence (series = 1) is titled "The Expulsion". I tested both interpretations against the dataset in public.my_info_table.
- I treated the accessible database as the authoritative source per instructions.
