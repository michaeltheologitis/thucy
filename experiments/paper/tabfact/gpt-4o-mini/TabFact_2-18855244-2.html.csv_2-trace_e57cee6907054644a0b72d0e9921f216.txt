Conclusion: Yes—Robert Garrett and James Connolly represent the same country (United States) in the available authoritative dataset.

Data source exploration:
- Discovered data source: A PostgreSQL database containing the table public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (medal-level information for athletes with multiple Olympic medals).
- Schema (relevant fields): athlete (text), nation (text), medal count (bigint), date (text), sport (text), record medal event (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
- Purpose: Retrieve distinct athlete names and their nations for Robert Garrett and James Connolly.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, nation FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Robert Garrett%' OR athlete ILIKE '%James Connolly%';
- Result:
  - James Connolly — United States
  - Robert Garrett — United States

Assessment:
- Both entries list the nation as United States, confirming they represented the same country in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to Olympic representation, and the individuals are the Olympians Robert Garrett (track and field) and James Connolly (track and field) captured in the multiple Olympic medalists dataset.
