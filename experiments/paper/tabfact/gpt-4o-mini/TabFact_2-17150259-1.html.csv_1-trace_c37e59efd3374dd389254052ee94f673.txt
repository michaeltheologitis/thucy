Claim to verify: "Lugo, Emilia-Romagna be the venue when the competition be Friendly on 26 May 1999 and the result be 2-4."

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single relevant table: karen_walker_footballer.
- Schema details (public.karen_walker_footballer): columns goal (bigint), date (text), venue (text), result (text), competition (text), scored (bigint).

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Sample data inspection showed a row for the exact date/venue/competition in question, including its recorded result:
- Returned row (excerpt):
  Date: 26 May 1999; Venue: Lugo, Emilia - Romagna; Competition: Friendly; Result: 1 - 4; Scored: 1; Goal: 17
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result, scored, goal FROM public.karen_walker_footballer LIMIT 20;

2) Targeted retrieval for the specified match (case-insensitive matching on date and venue components):
- Returned row confirms the match details and result:
  Date: 26 May 1999; Venue: Lugo, Emilia - Romagna; Competition: Friendly; Result: 1 - 4; Scored: 1; Goal: 17
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result, scored, goal 
  FROM public.karen_walker_footballer 
  WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%26 may 1999%'
    AND lower(venue) LIKE '%lugo%'
    AND lower(venue) LIKE '%emilia%'
    AND lower(venue) LIKE '%romagna%'
    AND lower(competition) = 'friendly';

3) Specific check for any match on that date with a result recorded as 2-4 (allowing spaces around the hyphen):
- No rows found.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, competition, result 
  FROM public.karen_walker_footballer 
  WHERE date ILIKE '%26 May 1999%'
    AND result ~* '^[ ]*2[ ]*-[ ]*4[ ]*$';

Findings
- Venue: Lugo, Emilia - Romagna — Supported by data.
- Competition: Friendly — Supported by data.
- Date: 26 May 1999 — Supported by data.
- Result: 2 - 4 — Contradicted by data. The recorded result is 1 - 4.

Conclusion
- The statement correctly identifies the venue, competition, and date, but incorrectly states the result. The database records the result as 1 - 4, not 2 - 4.

Assumptions
- The karen_walker_footballer table is treated as authoritative for match details relevant to this query, and the row matching date/venue/competition corresponds to the match the claim refers to.
