Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and schema.
- Verified column definitions relevant to the claim (top 5 and top 10).
- Computed Shane Hall’s total career top-5 and top-10 finishes from the dataset and checked for any per-year anomalies.

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table named shane_hall that stores racing statistics by year.

Schema details (relevant columns)
- Table: public.shane_hall
- Columns include: year, top 5 (bigint), top 10 (bigint), among others.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Career totals of top-5 and top-10 finishes
SQL:
SELECT SUM("top 5") AS total_top_5, SUM("top 10") AS total_top_10 FROM public.shane_hall;
Result: total_top_5 = 1, total_top_10 = 6.

2) Check for any years where top-5 exceeds top-10 (data quality/anomaly check)
SQL:
SELECT year, "top 5", "top 10" FROM public.shane_hall WHERE "top 5" > "top 10";
Result: No records found.

3) Optional context: compare top-5 vs 6th–10th finishes
SQL (top-5 total):
SELECT SUM("top 5") AS total_top_5_finishes
FROM public.shane_hall;
Result: 1
SQL (6th–10th total):
SELECT SUM("top 10") - SUM("top 5") AS total_6th_to_10th_finishes
FROM public.shane_hall;
Result: 5

Conclusion
- The data shows Shane Hall has 1 career top-5 finish and 6 career top-10 finishes. Therefore, he has not placed top 5 more than he has placed top 10. The claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to total career counts across all seasons represented in public.shane_hall. The table is assumed complete for Shane Hall’s recorded seasons.
