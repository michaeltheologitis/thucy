Data sources discovered
- A PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season (Arizona Diamondbacks 2008 season game log). Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

How I interpreted the claim
- I interpret “Rosales of Arizona Diamond have more loss than Johnson” as: In the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season game log, the number of games where the losing pitcher was Rosales is greater than the number where the losing pitcher was Johnson. The loss column appears to record the losing pitcher for each game (name plus season W-L at that time).

Evidence from the data
1) Inspect sample rows to understand columns
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt):
- september 1 | cardinals | 8 - 6 | mcclellan (2 - 7) | 35075 | 70 - 67
- september 2 | cardinals | 8 - 2 | petit (3 - 4)     | 27568 | 70 - 68
- september 3 | cardinals | 4 - 3 | perez (2 - 2)     | 24350 | 71 - 68
- september 5 | dodgers   | 7 - 0 | haren (14 - 8)    | 52270 | 71 - 69
- september 6 | dodgers   | 7 - 2 | webb (19 - 7)     | 47543 | 71 - 70
- september 7 | dodgers   | 5 - 3 | rauch (4 - 6)     | 54137 | 71 - 71
- september 8 | giants    | 6 - 2 | petit (3 - 5)     | 30252 | 71 - 72
- september 9 | giants    | 5 - 4 | rauch (4 - 7)     | 30518 | 71 - 73
- september 10| giants    | 4 - 3 | lyon (2 - 5)      | 30992 | 71 - 74
- september 12| reds      | 3 - 2 | harang (4 - 16)   | 29046 | 72 - 74
Interpretation: The loss column contains the losing pitcher’s name plus their W-L at that time.

2) Check distinct losing pitchers and confirm presence of Rosales and Johnson
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT loss FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Observed examples among distinct values:
- rosales (1 - 1)
- johnson (10 - 10)
- petit (3 - 4)
- webb (19 - 7)
- haren (14 - 8)

3) Count how many times each appears as the losing pitcher
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE loss ILIKE '%Johnson%';
Result: 1

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season WHERE loss ILIKE '%Rosales%';
Result: 1

Conclusion
- In this 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks game log, Rosales appears as the losing pitcher 1 time and Johnson appears 1 time. Therefore, Rosales does not have more losses than Johnson in this dataset; they are equal.

Assumptions
- The loss column denotes the losing pitcher for the game, irrespective of team. Given the names involved (Rosales and Johnson) and 2008 context, these refer to D-backs pitchers Leo Rosales and Randy Johnson.
- The verification is grounded strictly in the provided 2008 game log table. No external seasons or datasets are considered.
