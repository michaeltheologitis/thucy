Claim to verify: “Ettore Meini won 3 races in a row, on May 24, 25th and 26th, during the 1933 Giro d'Italia.”

Data source discovery
- Available schema and table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
  (Discovered via schema exploration; see executed SQL below.)

Table structure
- Columns in public.t_1933_giro_d_italia:
  - date (text)
  - course (text)
  - distance (text)
  - winner (text)
  - race leader (text)

Executed SQL (table structure)
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1933_giro_d_italia';

Evidence query and results
Purpose: Identify the stage winners on May 24, 25, and 26, 1933.

Executed SQL (May stages overview)
SELECT date, winner FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia WHERE date ILIKE '%May%' ORDER BY date ASC;

Relevant returned rows:
- 24 May — Winner: Ettore Meini (ITA)
- 25 May — Winner: Ettore Meini (ITA)
- 26 May — Winner: Gerard Loncke (BEL)

Analysis
- The data shows Ettore Meini won on May 24 and May 25, 1933.
- On May 26, 1933, the winner was Gerard Loncke, not Ettore Meini.
- Therefore, Ettore Meini did not win three races in a row on May 24–26, 1933. He won two consecutive stages (24th and 25th), but not the 26th.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the recorded stage results for those dates.

Assumptions
- The 'date' field lists 1933 Giro d'Italia stage dates using month names (e.g., “24 May”) and the 'winner' field records the stage winner for that date. Non-racing days appear as “Rest Day” entries and were not relevant to the verification.
