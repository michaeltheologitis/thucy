Claim interpreted: “The only player that does not have 0 FA Cup goals is Peter Hart.” Scope is the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season dataset available in the connected database.

Data source discovery
- Available table: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (player stats for the 1979–80 season)

Schema highlights
- Relevant columns: name (text), "fa cup goals" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Identify all players with FA Cup goals not equal to 0
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "fa cup goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" <> 0;
Result:
- Peter Hart — FA Cup Goals: 1

2) Count how many players have FA Cup goals not equal to 0
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" <> 0;
Result:
- player_count: 1

3) Full distribution check and validation of zeros/NULLs
SQL executed:
SELECT "name", "fa cup goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY "fa cup goals" DESC;
Result (top to bottom by goals):
- peter hart: 1
- All remaining 17 players: 0

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS players_with_zero_goals FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" = 0;
Result: 17

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS players_with_null_goals FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" IS NULL;
Result: 0

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one player with non-zero FA Cup goals: Peter Hart (1 goal). All other players have 0 FA Cup goals.

Assumptions
- “Doesn’t have 0 FA Cup goals” is interpreted as FA Cup goals > 0 (i.e., scored at least one). We verified there are no NULLs in the FA Cup goals column, so this interpretation matches the data.
- Claim is evaluated strictly within the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season dataset.
