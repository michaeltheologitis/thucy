Claim to verify: "alberto pagani have only win with 2 team : linto and mv agusta , all before 1967"

Data discovery and schema
- Available source: Database TabFact, schema public, table alberto_pagani with columns: year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint).

Evidence 1: Seasons with at least one win (year, class, team, wins)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, class, team, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
- Result:
  1969 | 500cc | linto     | 1
  1971 | 500cc | linto     | 1
  1971 | 500cc | mv agusta | 1
  1972 | 500cc | mv agusta | 1
- Interpretation: Alberto Pagani’s wins are recorded in 1969, 1971, and 1972 with the teams Linto and MV Agusta.

Evidence 2: Distinct teams with wins
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT team FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
- Result: Linto; MV Agusta
- Interpretation: All recorded wins are indeed with two teams: Linto and MV Agusta.

Evidence 3: Earliest and latest years with wins
- Executed SQL (min):
  SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
- Result: 1969
- Executed SQL (max):
  SELECT MAX(year) AS max_year FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
- Result: 1972
- Interpretation: Wins occurred from 1969 through 1972; therefore, they are not “all before 1967.”

Evidence 4: Totals by team and win years
- Executed SQL (totals by team):
  SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM alberto_pagani GROUP BY team;
- Executed SQL (years list):
  SELECT year, team FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY year;
- Results summary: Linto total wins = 2 (1969, 1971); MV Agusta total wins = 2 (1971, 1972).

Conclusion
- True: He has wins with only two teams—Linto and MV Agusta.
- False: The wins are not all before 1967; they are from 1969 to 1972.

Assumptions
- “Win” refers to the wins column in the alberto_pagani table (i.e., seasons where wins > 0).
- “Team” refers to the team field values in that table.
- Year comparisons are based on the year field in the same table.
