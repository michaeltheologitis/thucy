Claim to verify:
"the yugoslavian national team score 7 goal and allow 3 against in the 3 1982 world cup qualify match"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (date text, city text, opponent text, results text, "type of game" text).

Schema inspection result:
- Columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game.

Evidence 1: Identify qualifier records for the 1982 World Cup
Executed SQL:
SELECT "type of game", COUNT(*) as count FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results GROUP BY "type of game" ORDER BY count DESC;
Result (relevant):
- 1982 wcq: 3 rows

Evidence 2: List the three matches labeled as 1982 wcq
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results 
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq';
Returned rows:
1) Date: September 10, City: Luxembourg, Opponent: Luxembourg, Results: 5:0
2) Date: September 27, City: Ljubljana, Opponent: Denmark, Results: 2:1
3) Date: November 15, City: Torino, Italy, Opponent: Italy, Results: 0:2

Evidence 3: Aggregate goals for and against across those matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(CAST(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS total_goals_scored, 
       SUM(CAST(SPLIT_PART(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS total_goals_conceded, 
       COUNT(*) AS number_of_matches 
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE "type of game" = '1982 wcq';
Result:
- total_goals_scored: 7
- total_goals_conceded: 3
- number_of_matches: 3

Assessment:
- The database shows exactly three matches tagged as 1982 wcq, with cumulative results 7 scored and 3 conceded. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- The label "1982 wcq" denotes matches in qualification for the 1982 FIFA World Cup.
- The results field is formatted as Yugoslavia goals : opponent goals.
