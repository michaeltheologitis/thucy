Interpretation of the claim:
- I interpret the user’s statement as a verifiable claim against the available UPnP AV media servers dataset: “The entry whose Windows support is partial and whose Web interface is partial has the name ‘coherence.’”

Data source exploration:
- Available database discovered: TabFact
- Relevant table: comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers (columns: name, license, os x, unix - like, windows, web interface)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Check if any row has BOTH Windows = partial and Web interface = partial (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT name, windows, "web interface" 
FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers 
WHERE LOWER(windows) LIKE '%partial%' AND LOWER("web interface") LIKE '%partial%';
Result: No rows returned. This directly contradicts the condition that both fields are partial for any server.

2) Show rows where EITHER Windows or Web interface contains the word 'partial' (to see what exists and how 'coherence' appears)
SQL:
SELECT name, windows, "web interface" 
FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers 
WHERE LOWER(windows) LIKE '%partial%' 
OR LOWER("web interface") LIKE '%partial%';
Results:
- coherence | windows: partial | web interface: yes
- minidlna  | windows: yes     | web interface: partial
Interpretation: Coherence has Windows = partial but Web interface = yes (not partial). Minidlna has Web interface = partial but Windows = yes (not partial). No entry has both as partial.

3) Explicitly confirm the values for 'coherence'
SQL:
SELECT name, windows, "web interface" FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name = 'coherence';
Result:
- name: coherence | windows: partial | web interface: yes
This confirms Coherence does not have a partial Web interface in this dataset.

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains no entry where both Windows and Web interface are partial. Specifically, ‘coherence’ has Windows = partial but Web interface = yes. Therefore, the claim that “coherence be the name when window and web interface be partial” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguous phrasing):
- “window” refers to the “windows” column (Windows OS support) in the comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers table.
- “web interface” refers to the “web interface” column in the same table.
- “be the name” means the name of the media server entry that matches the stated conditions.
- Matching of “partial” was performed case-insensitively and by substring to capture any variations; results show exact values in this dataset are simply 'partial' or 'yes'.
