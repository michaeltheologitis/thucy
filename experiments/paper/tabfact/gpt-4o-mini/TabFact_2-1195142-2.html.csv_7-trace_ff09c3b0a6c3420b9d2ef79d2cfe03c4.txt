Summary of findings
- In the available data (a single table documenting awards related to the musical La Cage aux Folles), Jerry Mitchell is recorded with 1 Tony Award win (Best Choreography, 2005). The data does not show a second Tony Award win. Therefore, within this dataset, the claim is not supported.

Data sources discovered

  - Columns: year (bigint), award (text), category (text), nominee (text), result (text)

  AND result ILIKE 'Won%';
- Result rows:

Interpretation
- The available dataset records exactly 1 Tony Award win for Jerry Mitchell (Best Choreography, 2005) for La Cage aux Folles. There is no evidence in this dataset of a second Tony Award win. Thus, the claim of 2 Tony Awards is not supported by the data at hand.

Assumptions
- The user’s claim is interpreted as total career Tony Award wins. The available data is limited to awards related to La Cage aux Folles; it may not include awards from other productions. Conclusions are therefore based strictly on this dataset.
