Claim to verify: "the 2nd leg score be less than the first leg score for the match with a team 2 of werder bremen"

Data discovery and schema check:
- I identified a single relevant dataset: public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league (UEFA Europa League 2009–10 two-leg ties).
- To understand the table structure, I retrieved its columns.
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_2009_10_uefa_europa_league' 
  AND table_schema = 'public';

Result (summary):
- Columns: team 1 (text), agg (text), team 2 (text), 1st leg (text), 2nd leg (text)

Evidence retrieval and computation:
- I searched for the tie where the column "team 2" is Werder Bremen and parsed the 1st and 2nd leg scorelines to compare totals and Werder Bremen’s (team 2) goals across legs.
Executed SQL:
SELECT 
    "team 1",
    "team 2",
    "1st leg",
    "2nd leg", 
    (CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS total_1st,
    (CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS total_2nd,
    CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS team2_goals_1st,
    CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS team2_goals_2nd,
    (CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER)) < (CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS total_2nd_less_total_1st,
    CAST(SPLIT_PART("2nd leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER) < CAST(SPLIT_PART("1st leg", '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS team2_goals_2nd_less_team2_goals_1st
FROM 
    public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league 
WHERE 
    LOWER("team 2") = 'werder bremen';

Key results:
- Team 1: Valencia; Team 2: Werder Bremen
- 1st leg: 1 - 1 (total goals = 2; Werder Bremen goals = 1)
- 2nd leg: 4 - 4 (total goals = 8; Werder Bremen goals = 4)
- Is total goals in 2nd leg less than in 1st leg? No (8 < 2 is false)
- Did Werder Bremen score fewer in the 2nd leg than in the 1st? No (4 < 1 is false)

Conclusion:
- For the tie with Werder Bremen as "team 2", the second leg had more goals than the first leg, not fewer. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "team 2 of werder bremen" as the row where the column "team 2" equals Werder Bremen in the 2009–10 UEFA Europa League dataset.
- Interpreted "2nd leg score less than the first leg score" in two reasonable ways: (a) total goals in the second leg vs first leg; (b) goals by the team labeled as "team 2" (Werder Bremen) in second leg vs first leg. Both interpretations are false per the data.
- If the intent was "Werder Bremen II" (reserve team), that team does not appear in this Europa League dataset.
