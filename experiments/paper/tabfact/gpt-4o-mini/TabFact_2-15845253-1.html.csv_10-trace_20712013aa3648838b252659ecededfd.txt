Claim to verify: “9 viral family have a replication site in the cytoplasm.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: viral_disease
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Step 1: Inspect replication site categories and counts (records)
SQL executed:
SELECT "replication site", COUNT(*) as count_records 
FROM viral_disease 
GROUP BY "replication site";

Result:
- Cytoplasm: 14 records
- Nucleus: 9 records

Step 2: Enumerate distinct families and their replication sites
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT family, "replication site" FROM viral_disease;

Result (excerpt shows all distinct families):
- Cytoplasm: Bunyaviridae, Filoviridae, Caliciviridae, Coronaviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, Arenaviridae, Flaviviridae, Picornaviridae, Hepeviridae, Poxviridae, Reoviridae, Togaviridae, Astroviridae
- Nucleus: Orthomyxoviridae, Hepadnaviridae, Papillomaviridae, Polyomaviridae, Parvoviridae, Unassigned, Herpesviridae, Retroviridae, Adenoviridae

Step 3: Count and list distinct families with replication in cytoplasm
SQL executed (listing):
SELECT DISTINCT family FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';

SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) FROM viral_disease WHERE "replication site" = 'cytoplasm';

Result:
- Distinct families (14): Arenaviridae; Astroviridae; Bunyaviridae; Caliciviridae; Coronaviridae; Filoviridae; Flaviviridae; Hepeviridae; Paramyxoviridae; Picornaviridae; Poxviridae; Reoviridae; Rhabdoviridae; Togaviridae
- Count: 14

Conclusion
- The data show 14 distinct viral families with replication site in the cytoplasm, not 9. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “family” denotes viral family classifications as recorded in the viral_disease.viral_disease table.
- “replication site” values are authoritative and standardized in this dataset; case sensitivity in the sample SQL does not affect the tool’s returned results.
- The entry “Unassigned” (seen under nucleus) is not a viral family and is not counted among cytoplasm-replicating families (which are explicitly listed).
