Claim being checked: “the game against new orleans have the highest attendance.”

Data source overview
- Database: public schema
- Table: t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season subset)
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text; opponent), "location attendance" (text; venue with possible trailing attendance number), record (text)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to understand how attendance is stored
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt):
- april 5 | game 77 | american airlines center 20301 | team dallas
- april 8 | game 78 | new orleans arena 17781 | team new orleans
- Several other rows show trailing integers at the end of the location string representing attendance

Step 2: Quantify attendance coverage and find maximum attendance
SQL (total games and count with attendance using regex):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games, 
       COUNT(CASE WHEN "location attendance" ~ '\d+$' THEN 1 END) AS games_with_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season;
Result:
- total_games = 8
- games_with_attendance = 7

SQL (maximum attendance using regex extract):
SELECT MAX((regexp_matches("location attendance", '\d+$'))[1])::int AS max_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\d+$';
Result:
- max_attendance = 20301

Step 3: Identify the game(s) with the maximum attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, team, "location attendance",  
       (regexp_matches("location attendance", '\d+$'))[1]::int AS attendance_num  
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season  
WHERE (regexp_matches("location attendance", '\d+$'))[1]::int = 
    (SELECT MAX((regexp_matches("location attendance", '\d+$'))[1])::int  
     FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season  
     WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\d+$');
Result:
- date: april 5 | team: dallas | location: american airlines center 20301 | attendance_num: 20301

Step 4: Check the New Orleans game(s) and their attendance
SQL (list New Orleans games and parse attendance):
SELECT date, team, "location attendance" AS location_attendance, 
  CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '(\d+)$') AS INT) AS attendance_num 
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
WHERE team ILIKE 'new orleans';
Result:
- date: april 8 | team: new orleans | location_attendance: new orleans arena 17781 | attendance_num: 17781

SQL (confirm overall max attendance using substring):
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '(\d+)$') AS INT)) AS max_attendance 
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season;
Result:
- max_attendance = 20301

Conclusion
- The highest recorded attendance in the available dataset is 20,301 for the game vs Dallas on April 5.
- The game vs New Orleans on April 8 had an attendance of 17,781, which is not the highest.
- Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Phoenix Suns games represented in the available table (8 games late in the 2008–09 season).
- Attendance is the trailing integer in the "location attendance" field; missing trailing digits are treated as missing attendance (null).
