Claim interpreted: Among the athletes with the longest marks in the available long jump dataset, the majority are from the United States.

What I checked and found
1) Structure and sample of the data
- Data source discovery indicates a single relevant table: public.long_jump with columns: mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text).
- Sample inspection of rows showed marks formatted as strings like "8.95 m (29ft4¼in)" and nationality values like "United States".

Executed SQL (evidence):
- Sample rows
  SQL:
  SELECT mark, nationality FROM long_jump LIMIT 10;

- Count of total rows
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM long_jump;
  Result: 10

2) Who holds the single longest mark (max) and their nationality
- I converted the mark to a numeric value (meters) using split_part to extract the leading numeric component, then found the maximum and listed the matching row(s).

Executed SQL (evidence):
- Find max mark
  SQL:
  SELECT MAX(split_part(mark, ' ', 1)::numeric) AS max_mark FROM long_jump;
  Result: 8.95

- List athlete(s) at the max
  SQL:
  SELECT athlete, nationality FROM long_jump WHERE split_part(mark, ' ', 1)::numeric = 8.95;
  Result: Mike Powell, United States

Conclusion for the single longest mark: The athlete with the longest mark is from the United States.

3) Whether a majority of the top marks in the dataset are from the United States
- I listed all records, parsed numeric marks for ordering, and then grouped by nationality to count representation among these top 10 performances.

Executed SQL (evidence):
- List all rows with numeric mark (for transparency)
  SQL:
  SELECT athlete, mark, nationality, split_part(mark, ' ', 1)::numeric AS numeric_mark
  FROM long_jump
  ORDER BY numeric_mark DESC;
  Result (abridged to key fields):
  1) Mike Powell — 8.95 — United States
  2) Bob Beamon — 8.90 — United States
  3) Carl Lewis — 8.87 — United States
  4) Robert Emmiyan — 8.86 — Soviet Union
  5) Larry Myricks — 8.74 — United States
  6) Erick Walder — 8.74 — United States
  7) Dwight Phillips — 8.74 — United States
  8) Irving Saladino — 8.73 — Panama
  9) Iván Pedroso — 8.71 — Cuba
  10) Loúis Tsátoumas — 8.66 — Greece

- Count records by nationality
  SQL:
  SELECT nationality, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM long_jump GROUP BY nationality ORDER BY cnt DESC, nationality;
  Result:
  • United States — 6
  • Cuba — 1
  • Greece — 1
  • Panama — 1
  • Soviet Union — 1

- Share for the United States (optional computation)
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM long_jump;
  Result: 10
  Therefore, United States share = 6/10 = 60%.

Conclusion for majority: In this dataset of the top long jump marks, 6 out of 10 performances (60%) are by athletes from the United States, which is a majority.

Overall assessment
- The single longest mark is held by a United States athlete (Mike Powell, 8.95 m).
- Among the longest marks represented in this dataset (10 rows), the majority are by United States athletes (6/10).

Assumptions
- I interpreted “athlete with the longest mark” and “longest mark” to refer to the top-performance records contained in the available long_jump table (10 rows representing the longest long jump marks). If the intended scope was different (e.g., another event or a broader dataset), results could differ, but within this data the claim is supported.
