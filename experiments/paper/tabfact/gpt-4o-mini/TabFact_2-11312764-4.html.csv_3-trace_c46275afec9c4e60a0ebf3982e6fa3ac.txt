Summary of the claim
Claim: "bodil olsson be not from switzerland and do not receive 27 sp + f"
Interpretation: The claim has two parts about the participant Bodil Olsson in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships table: (1) her nation is not Switzerland, and (2) her combined short program + free skate score (sp + fs) is not 27.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
  - Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), "sp + fs" (bigint), points (double precision), places (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial exact-name lookup (no rows returned)
SQL:
SELECT name, nation, "sp + fs" FROM t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name = 'Bodil Olsson';
Result: 0 rows

2) Case-insensitive, partial-name lookup (found the participant)
SQL:
SELECT name, nation, "sp + fs" FROM t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Bodil Olsson%';
Result:
- name: Bodil Olsson
- nation: Sweden
- sp + fs: 23

3) Verification that her nation is not Switzerland
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_switzerland
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE name ILIKE 'Bodil Olsson' AND nation = 'Switzerland';
Result: count_switzerland = 0

4) Verification that her "sp + fs" is not 27
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_sp_fs_27
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
WHERE name ILIKE 'Bodil Olsson' AND "sp + fs" = 27;
Result: count_sp_fs_27 = 0

Assessment
- Part 1 (not from Switzerland): Supported. The participant record for Bodil Olsson lists nation = Sweden, and there are zero records for her with nation = Switzerland.
- Part 2 (did not receive 27 sp + f): Supported. Her "sp + fs" value is 23, and there are zero records for her with "sp + fs" = 27.

Conclusion
Both components of the claim are supported by the data; therefore, the overall claim is verified.

Assumptions
- "sp + f" in the claim is interpreted as the table column "sp + fs" (combined short program + free skate).
- Name matching used case-insensitive search due to the initial exact match returning no rows (possible whitespace or formatting differences in the stored name).
