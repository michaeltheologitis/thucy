Scope grounding: Available data covers the National Basketball League (NBL) 2008–09 season in table public.t_2008_09_nbl_season.

Data source discovery:
- Found PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2008_09_nbl_season (NBL 2008–09 season).

Schema review (public.t_2008_09_nbl_season):
- Columns: team (text), lost (bigint), last 5 (text), streak (text), home (text), away (text), % pts (double precision), % won (double precision).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve losses for New Zealand Breakers and Melbourne Tigers
SQL:
SELECT team, lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team ILIKE 'new zealand breakers' OR team ILIKE 'melbourne tigers'
Result:
- New Zealand Breakers: lost = 12
- Melbourne Tigers: lost = 10

2) Compute difference in losses (Breakers minus Tigers)
SQL:
SELECT (SELECT lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team ILIKE 'new zealand breakers') - (SELECT lost FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team ILIKE 'melbourne tigers') AS difference
Result:
- difference = 2

Assessment:
- The New Zealand Breakers had 12 losses and the Melbourne Tigers had 10 losses in the 2008–09 season. The difference is 2, matching the claim that the Breakers lost 2 more games than the Tigers.
