Claim interpreted: “Alabama be the opponent when they play at Legion Field, Birmingham, AL.” I interpret “they” as the East Carolina Pirates football team and the context as the historical data available (1990–1999).

Data sources explored:
- Database: public
- Table: east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 (columns: date TEXT, opponent TEXT, site TEXT, result TEXT, attendance TEXT)

What I checked:
1) Located any games with site containing “Legion” or “Birmingham” to identify the opponent.

Evidence from executed SQL:
- SQL 1:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result 
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 
WHERE site ILIKE '%Legion%' OR site ILIKE '%Birmingham%';
Result: One row found — Date: October 17; Opponent: Alabama; Site: Legion Field Birmingham, AL; Result: L 22 - 23.

- SQL 2:
SELECT date, opponent, site, result 
FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 
WHERE site ILIKE '%Birmingham%' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
Result: One row found — Date: October 17; Opponent: Alabama; Site: Legion Field Birmingham, AL; Result: L22 - 23.

Conclusion:
- The dataset records a game played at “Legion Field Birmingham, AL” where the opponent was Alabama. This supports the claim that Alabama was the opponent when they (East Carolina) played at Legion Field in Birmingham, AL.

Assumptions:
- “They” refers to the East Carolina Pirates football team.
- Verification is limited to the available dataset (1990–1999). The date field in this dataset does not include a year, but the site and opponent match conclusively.
