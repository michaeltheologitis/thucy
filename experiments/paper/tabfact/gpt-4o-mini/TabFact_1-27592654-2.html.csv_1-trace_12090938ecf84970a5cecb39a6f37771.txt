Claim interpreted: “Nelson is not the province for the electorate of Collingwood.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_3rd_new_zealand_parliament
- Relevant columns: member (text), electorate (text), province (text), mps term (text), election date (text)

Evidence
1) Search for any Collingwood electorate entries and their provinces
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT electorate, province FROM public.t_3rd_new_zealand_parliament WHERE LOWER(electorate) LIKE '%collingwood%';
Result:
- electorate: collingwood, province: nelson

2) Confirm province(s) for electorate exactly equal to Collingwood (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT province FROM public.t_3rd_new_zealand_parliament WHERE LOWER(electorate) = LOWER('Collingwood');
Result:
- Nelson

Conclusion
The data shows the electorate Collingwood is associated with the province Nelson. Therefore, the claim that “Nelson is not the province for the electorate of Collingwood” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- ‘Electorate of Collingwood’ refers to the Collingwood parliamentary electorate as represented in the table for the 3rd New Zealand Parliament period.
- ‘Province’ refers to the province field in the dataset, representing the provincial association recorded for that period.
