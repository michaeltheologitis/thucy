Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Maggs Magnificent Mild received a bronze award two times at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005.”

Summary of findings:
- The data shows no bronze awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition for Maggs Magnificent Mild between 1995 and 2005.
- Within that period, the beer won a Gold at the SIBA National Beer Competition in 2003. There are bronze results in 2005 at the SIBA South East Region Beer Competition (not national), which do not satisfy the claim.

Step 1: Confirm available tables and columns
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: public.west_berkshire_brewery

- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result (for west_berkshire_brewery):
  year (bigint), "beer name" (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)

Step 2: List all awards for Maggs Magnificent Mild
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, prize, category, competition FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE lower("beer name") = lower('Maggs Magnificent Mild') ORDER BY year, competition, prize;
- Key results relevant to claim window:
  • 2003 – SIBA National Beer Competition – Gold Medal (Category: Mild and Porter)
  • 2005 – SIBA South East Region Beer Competition – Bronze Medal (Overall) [Regional, not National]

Step 3: Direct check for bronze at SIBA National, 1995–2005
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS bronze_national_count FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE lower("beer name") = lower('Maggs Magnificent Mild') AND lower(competition) = lower('SIBA National Beer Competition') AND lower(prize) = lower('Bronze') AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005;
- Result: 0

Step 4: List any SIBA National results for 1995–2005 to show what exists
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, prize, category FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE lower("beer name") = lower('Maggs Magnificent Mild') AND lower(competition) = lower('SIBA National Beer Competition') AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2005 ORDER BY year;
- Result: 2003 – Gold – Mild and Porter

Step 5: Broader check allowing variations like “Bronze Medal” wording
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, prize, category, competition FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery WHERE lower("beer name") = lower('Maggs Magnificent Mild') AND lower(competition) LIKE '%siba national%' AND lower(prize) LIKE '%bronze%' ORDER BY year;
- Result: No rows

Conclusion:
- The data does not support the claim. Maggs Magnificent Mild did not receive two bronze awards at the SIBA National Beer Competition between 1995 and 2005; in that window it won a Gold at the SIBA National in 2003 and a Bronze at a regional SIBA competition in 2005.

Assumptions:
- “SIBA National Beer Competition” is matched against the competition field exactly or via substring for variants; “bronze award” is matched via prize equal to “Bronze” or containing the word “bronze” (e.g., “Bronze Medal”).
- The time window is inclusive of 1995 and 2005.
