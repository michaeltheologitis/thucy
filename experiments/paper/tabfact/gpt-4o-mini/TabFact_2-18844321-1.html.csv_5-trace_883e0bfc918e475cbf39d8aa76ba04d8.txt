Summary of finding
- Claim interpreted: “All 4 test matches took place in October 1978.” We verify this against the available 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland.
- Table: t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland.

Schema details
- Columns: "opposing team" (text), "against" (bigint), "date" (text), "venue" (text), "status" (text).

Evidence 1: There are 4 test matches in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT status, COUNT(*) as count FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland GROUP BY status;
- Result:
  - tour match: 14
  - test match: 4

Evidence 2: Actual dates for the test matches
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "opposing team", venue 
  FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
  WHERE status = 'test match' 
  ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result:
  1) 4 November 1978 — Ireland — Lansdowne Road, Dublin
  2) 11 November 1978 — Wales — Cardiff Arms Park, Cardiff
  3) 25 November 1978 — England — Twickenham, London
  4) 9 December 1978 — Scotland — Murrayfield, Edinburgh

Evidence 3: Were there any test matches in October 1978?
- Executed SQL (list all October entries):
  SELECT date, status FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE date ILIKE '%October 1978%';
- Result:
  - 18 October 1978 — tour match
  - 21 October 1978 — tour match
  - 25 October 1978 — tour match
  - 28 October 1978 — tour match
  - 31 October 1978 — tour match
- Executed SQL (count October test matches):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS test_match_count FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE date ILIKE '%October 1978%' AND status = 'test match';
- Result:
  - test_match_count = 0

Conclusion
- None of the four test matches occurred in October 1978. Three occurred in November and one in December 1978. Therefore, the claim that “all 4 test match take place in October of 1978” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland, which is the authoritative data source available. “Test match” is interpreted as rugby union international tests on that tour. “All 4” refers to the four test matches identified in the dataset.
