Claim to verify: "the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score of 2:1"

Data source discovery:
- Available table: public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (historical results for the Yugoslavia national football team)

Schema (from the database):
- date (text)
- city (text)
- opponent (text)
- results (text)
- type of game (text)

Step 1: Identify available match types and their counts
SQL:
SELECT "type of game", TRIM("type of game") AS trimmed_value, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
GROUP BY "type of game", trimmed_value
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result (trimmed values):
- 1982 wcq: 3
- balkan cup: 2
- friendly: 2

Step 2: List all friendlies (date, city, opponent, results)
SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results 
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE LOWER(TRIM("type of game")) = 'friendly' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
Results:
1) Date: March 22, City: Sarajevo, Opponent: Uruguay, Results: 2:1
2) Date: April 26, City: Borovo, Opponent: Poland, Results: 2:1

Step 3: Count friendlies overall and friendlies with result 2:1
SQL (total friendlies):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_friendly_matches 
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE LOWER(TRIM("type of game")) = 'friendly';
Result: 2

SQL (friendlies with 2:1):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS friendly_match_results_2_1 
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE LOWER(TRIM("type of game")) = 'friendly' 
AND TRIM(results) = '2:1';
Result: 2

Step 4: Confirm that a format of "X:Y" means Yugoslavia scored X and opponent scored Y (so 2:1 implies Yugoslavia win)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, results, "type of game" 
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(results FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) < CAST(SUBSTRING(results FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER);
Sample results indicating losses (first number lower than second):
- Date: August 27, Opponent: Romania, Results: 1:4, Type of Game: Balkan Cup
- Date: November 15, Opponent: Italy, Results: 0:2, Type of Game: 1982 WCQ
Interpretation: The first number corresponds to Yugoslavia’s goals, confirming that 2:1 indicates a Yugoslavia win.

Conclusion:
- The database records exactly two matches classified as friendlies.
- Both friendlies have a result of 2:1.
- Given the score formatting (first number is Yugoslavia’s goals), both are Yugoslavia wins.
Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Results" are formatted as Yugoslavia goals : opponent goals (validated by Step 4).
- "Both of its friendly match" refers to the complete set of friendly matches recorded in this dataset (which totals two).
