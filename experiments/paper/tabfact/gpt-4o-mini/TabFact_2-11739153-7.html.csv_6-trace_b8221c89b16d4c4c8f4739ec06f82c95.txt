Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the difference in the score on February 10 and February 24 be more than 2.

What I checked:
- Identify the games played on February 10 and February 24 in the 2007–08 season and compute the goal differential (absolute difference between the two teams’ final scores) for each game. Then assess whether that difference is more than 2.

Evidence from the data:
1) Pulled game rows (includes both February 10 and February 24) and inspected the score column.

Executed SQL (with returned rows shown by the tool):
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 50;

Returned rows excerpt (relevant lines shown by the tool):
- February 10 | Minnesota | 2 - 1 | St Louis   | Harding
- February 24 | Calgary   | 2 - 1 | Minnesota  | Backstrom

Interpretation of the score field:
- The score is stored as "visitor_goals - home_goals" (as illustrated by multiple rows, e.g., February 2 shows Minnesota as visitor with score 4 - 1 at Columbus, consistent with visitor-first formatting).

Computed goal differentials:
- February 10: Minnesota (visitor) 2 – St Louis (home) 1 → differential = |2 - 1| = 1
- February 24: Calgary (visitor) 2 – Minnesota (home) 1 → differential = |2 - 1| = 1

Assessment against the claim:
- The goal differential on February 10 is 1, and on February 24 is 1. Neither is more than 2. Therefore, the claim that the difference in the score on those dates is more than 2 is not supported by the data.

Conclusion: The evidence shows both games had a one-goal margin, not more than two.

Assumptions made:
- "Difference in the score" is interpreted as the goal differential (final-score margin) for each specified game date within the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season.
- Dates refer to the 2007–08 season’s calendar (the table shows entries with month/day only, matching those two dates).
