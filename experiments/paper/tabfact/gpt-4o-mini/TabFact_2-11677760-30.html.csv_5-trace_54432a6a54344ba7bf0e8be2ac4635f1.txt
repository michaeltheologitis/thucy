Claim to verify: "the hometown of the last player of the list be las vega , nv"

Data source identified:
- Database schema includes table public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team with columns: player (text), height (text), school (text), hometown (text), college (text).

Evidence gathered:
1) Total rows in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team;
Result: 5

2) Determine the last player alphabetically by player and their hometown
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team ORDER BY player DESC LIMIT 1;
Result: player = "Shabazz Muhammad", hometown = "Las Vegas, NV"

Assessment:
- Interpreting "last player of the list" as the last alphabetically by player name, the hometown of that player (Shabazz Muhammad) is "Las Vegas, NV". This matches the claim aside from minor capitalization and spacing differences ("las vega , nv" vs. "Las Vegas, NV").

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "the list" refers to the table public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team.
- "last player" is interpreted as the last entry when ordering by player in descending lexicographical order (i.e., last alphabetically).
