What the data shows:
- The maximum recorded attendance in the dataset is 18,711.

2) Ordering games by attendance to see the top values
SQL:
SELECT date, team AS opponent, SUBSTRING("location attendance", '([0-9]+)$')::int AS attendance 
FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season

LIMIT 15;
Top results returned by the tool:

        team AS opponent,
        "location attendance" AS location,
        SUBSTRING("location attendance", '([0-9]+)$')::int AS attendance
    FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season
)
SELECT date, opponent, location, attendance
FROM attendance_data
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM attendance_data);
Result:
- Date: April 3 | Opponent: Miami | Location: Prudential Center 18711 | Attendance: 18711

Conclusion: The dataset shows the most highly attended game was indeed against Miami at the Prudential Center, with an attendance of 18,711.
