Claim assessed: “Brendan Melnyk be lead and Ted Appelman be third / vice skip.”

Data source explored: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials (columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city)

Findings grounded in data:
- The dataset contains a team from Edmonton with the following lineup:
  - Lead: Brendan Melnyk
  - Second: Braden Klassen
  - Third / Vice Skip: Tom Appelman
  - Skip: Ted Appelman
- There are no entries where “third / vice skip” is Ted Appelman.

Executed SQL queries and results:
1) Query (broad name search to locate relevant row):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials
WHERE lead ILIKE '%Melnyk%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Appelman%';
Result: City = Edmonton; Lead = Brendan Melnyk; Second = Braden Klassen; Third / Vice Skip = Tom Appelman; Skip = Ted Appelman.

2) Query (confirm lead details):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE lead ILIKE '%Melnyk%';
Result: City = Edmonton; Lead = Brendan Melnyk; Second = Braden Klassen; Third / Vice Skip = Tom Appelman; Skip = Ted Appelman.

3) Query (check if Ted Appelman ever appears as third / vice skip):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Ted Appelman%';
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion based on evidence:
- “Brendan Melnyk be lead” is supported by the data.
- “Ted Appelman be third / vice skip” is contradicted by the data; he is listed as the skip, while Tom Appelman is the third / vice skip.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to team lineups as recorded in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset, which is the available authoritative source in this environment.
