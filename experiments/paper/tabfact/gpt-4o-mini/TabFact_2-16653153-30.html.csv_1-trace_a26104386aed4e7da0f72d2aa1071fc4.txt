Claim: “the melbourne tiger have the same away record as south dragon.”

Interpretation: Compare the away records of the Melbourne Tigers and South Dragons for the season represented in the available dataset and determine if they are identical.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: t_2008_09_nbl_season(team text, lost bigint, "last 5" text, streak text, home text, away text, "% pts" double precision, "% won" double precision)

Evidence gathered:
1) List all teams and their away records in the available season dataset (to see exact team names and values):
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, away FROM t_2008_09_nbl_season;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- South Dragons | 9 - 6
- Melbourne Tigers | 9 - 6

2) Directly retrieve the two teams’ away records to confirm equality (handling any potential spacing/case variations in names):
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, away FROM t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE team ILIKE '%South Dragons%' OR team ILIKE '%Melbourne Tigers%';
Result:
- Team: South Dragons | Away Record: 9 - 6
- Team: Melbourne Tigers | Away Record: 9 - 6

Conclusion:
- In the available 2008–09 NBL season dataset, Melbourne Tigers and South Dragons both have an away record of 9 - 6. Thus, they have the same away record in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the season represented by the accessible table (2008–09 NBL season). If the claim intended a different season, that is outside the scope of the available data.
- “Away record” is taken directly from the “away” column of t_2008_09_nbl_season.
- Team names are matched as stored in the dataset (case/spacing handled via ILIKE).
