Claim interpreted: “The Buffalo Bills lose 3 more games than they win.”
Scope used for verification: The only available data source pertains to the 1976 Buffalo Bills season. Therefore, I verify the claim against the 1976 season results.

Data discovery and schema inspection
- Evidence: List all tables
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
  Result excerpt (relevant):
  - public | t_1976_buffalo_bills_season

- Evidence: Columns for tables mentioning buffalo/bills/1976
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name ILIKE '%buffalo%' OR table_name ILIKE '%bills%' OR table_name ILIKE '%1976%';
  Result (for public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season):
  - week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Season results evidence (1976 Buffalo Bills)
- Distinct result values and counts
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS count 
  FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season 
  GROUP BY result;
  Returned values (frequency):
  - l 20 - 10: 1
  - l 27 - 14: 1
  - l 31 - 13: 1
  - l 34 - 13: 1
  - l 26 - 22: 1
  - l 30 - 21: 1
  - l 45 - 27: 1
  - w 14 - 9: 1
  - l 19 - 14: 1
  - l 58 - 20: 1
  - w 50 - 17: 1
  - l 13 - 3: 1
  - l 17 - 14: 1
  - l 17 - 10: 1

- Total games
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
  Result: total_rows = 14

- Win/Loss/Tie counts (case-insensitive parsing of result)
  Executed SQL (wins):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'w%';
  Executed SQL (losses):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 'l%';
  Executed SQL (ties):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS ties FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE result ILIKE 't%';
  Results:
  - Wins = 2
  - Losses = 12
  - Ties = 0

Assessment against the claim
- The 1976 Buffalo Bills had 2 wins and 12 losses; losses exceed wins by 10, not 3.
- Therefore, within the available data (1976 season), the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the buffalo bill lose 3 more game than they win” as referring to the Buffalo Bills’ 1976 NFL season because that is the only season present in the available data source.
- Treated the ‘result’ field values starting with “w”, “l”, or “t” (case-insensitive) as win, loss, or tie indicators.
- Interpreted “game” as “games” and “Buffalo Bill” as “Buffalo Bills” (NFL team).
