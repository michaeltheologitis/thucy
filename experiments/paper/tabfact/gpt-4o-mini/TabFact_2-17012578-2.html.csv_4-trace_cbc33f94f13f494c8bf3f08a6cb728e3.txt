Conclusion: The claim is supported by the available data.

Data sources explored:
- Accessible PostgreSQL database: 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials Database (schema: public; table: t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials with columns: skip, third / vice skip, second, lead, city).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify how “Beausejour” appears in the data (case-insensitive search):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city ILIKE '%beaus%';
Result:
- beausejour

2) Retrieve the team entry for the city exactly equal to 'beausejour':
SQL:
SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city = 'beausejour';
Result:
- Skip: Jason Gunnlaugson; Third / Vice Skip: Justin Richter; Second: Braden Zawada; Lead: Tyler Forrest; City: Beausejour

This directly shows that the team from Beausejour lists Tyler Forrest as the lead.

Assumptions made:
- “lead” is interpreted as the curling team position.
- “beausejour” refers to the City field in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset.
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of this dataset (not about a TV show or other domain).
