Claim: “the game against New Orleans didn’t have the highest attendance.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Available dataset: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–2009 season).
- Relevant columns per schema: date (text), team (opponent), location attendance (venue name followed by attendance as a trailing integer), record.

Evidence from executed queries
1) Sample of season games (includes the New Orleans game and another game with a higher attendance):
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
LIMIT 10;

Result excerpt (as returned by the query):
- Game 77 | April 5  | Team: Dallas       | Location Attendance: American Airlines Center 20301 | Record: 42 - 35
- Game 78 | April 8  | Team: New Orleans  | Location Attendance: New Orleans Arena 17781        | Record: 43 - 35

Analysis
- The New Orleans game listed (April 8) had an attendance of 17,781.
- Another game (April 5 vs Dallas) had an attendance of 20,301.
- Since 20,301 > 17,781, the New Orleans game did not have the highest attendance among the games shown and, by direct counterexample, did not hold the highest attendance in the dataset.

Conclusion: The evidence supports the claim that the game against New Orleans didn’t have the highest attendance.

Assumptions
- “The game against New Orleans” refers to the April 8 game shown in the dataset (Phoenix vs New Orleans at New Orleans Arena).
- Attendance is taken as the trailing integer in the “location attendance” field.
