Summary conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. In the available dataset (public.t_1972_vfl_season), 100% of away teams recorded total points > 10, not 1/3.

Data discovery
- Objective: Identify available data sources and confirm the relevant table.
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  1) List base tables via information_schema.tables
     SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
  2) List tables via pg_catalog.pg_tables
     SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;
- Result: Table public.t_1972_vfl_season is present.

Schema inspection
- Objective: Understand the structure of public.t_1972_vfl_season.
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  1) Columns and types
     SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, ordinal_position
     FROM information_schema.columns
     WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1972_vfl_season';
  2) Column descriptions
     SELECT a.attname AS column_name, d.description
     FROM pg_catalog.pg_attribute a
     LEFT JOIN pg_catalog.pg_description d ON d.objoid = a.attrelid AND d.objsubid = a.attnum
     WHERE a.attrelid = 'public.t_1972_vfl_season'::regclass;
- Key columns: "away team" (text), "away team score" (text). Scores are stored as strings like G.B (Pts), e.g., 9.11 (65).

Sample values (to validate score format)
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT "away team", "away team score" FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
- Sample result (abridged): st kilda | 9.11 (65); north melbourne | 9.12 (66); richmond | 17.9 (111); south melbourne | 8.15 (63); geelong | 15.8 (98); melbourne | 8.10 (58). The number inside parentheses is the total points.

Verification of the claim
Claim interpreted as: Among away team appearances (i.e., rows in this table), the share with total points > 10 equals one third. We extract the total points from the parentheses and compute the proportion.

- Total matches, matches with away total points > 10, and proportion
  Evidence (executed SQL):
  1) Total matches
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches
     FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
  2) Matches with away team total points > 10 (extract number in parentheses)
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_gt_10 
     FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season 
     WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) > 10;
  3) Combined calculation
     SELECT
         matches_gt_10,
         total_matches,
         (matches_gt_10::float / total_matches) AS proportion
     FROM (
         SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_gt_10,
                (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season) AS total_matches
         FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
         WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) > 10
     ) AS stats;
- Results: total_matches = 6; matches_gt_10 = 6; proportion = 1.0 (100%).

- Sanity check: Are there any rows with parsed total points <= 10 or NULL?
  Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT "away team", "away team score", CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS parsed_points
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
  WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) <= 10 OR "away team score" IS NULL;
- Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- Based on the dataset, 100% of away team appearances recorded total points greater than 10. The claim that only 1/3 of the away team have a score greater than 10 is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity)
- “Score” refers to the total points (the number inside parentheses in the "away team score" string, e.g., 65 in 9.11 (65)).
- “Away team” refers to away team appearances (rows) in the available table for the 1972 VFL season data. No player-level scoring data is available in this dataset, so the claim is verified against team-level match results.
