Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table named public.whlp.
- Inspected the table structure to identify relevant columns, notably "erp w" (bigint), which appears to represent effective radiated power in watts.
- Interpreted the user’s fragment as the claim: “The number 2 is the only value appearing in the 'erp w' column.”
- Queried the dataset to count rows, count distinct values in "erp w", and list those distinct values with their frequencies.

Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Enumerate schemas and tables
SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
Result excerpt confirms: schema public has table whlp.

SQL:
SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables ORDER BY schemaname, tablename;
Result excerpt confirms: schema public has table whlp.

2) Describe columns of public.whlp
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length, numeric_precision, numeric_scale 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'whlp';
Result (relevant column shown):
- column_name: erp w, data_type: bigint, is_nullable: YES
(Other columns: call sign [text], frequency mhz [double precision], city of license [text], class [text], fcc info [text])

3) Row count and distinct stats for "erp w"
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp;
Result: 6

SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "erp w"), MIN("erp w"), MAX("erp w") FROM public.whlp;
Results: Distinct Count: 5, Min: 2, Max: 80

4) Distinct values of "erp w" with counts
SQL:
SELECT "erp w", COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp GROUP BY "erp w" ORDER BY "erp w" ASC;
Results:
- 2 → 1 row
- 10 → 2 rows
- 19 → 1 row
- 38 → 1 row
- 80 → 1 row

Assessment against the claim
- If the claim is interpreted as “2 is the only value present in the 'erp w' column,” the data clearly contradicts it. There are 5 distinct values (2, 10, 19, 38, 80), so 2 is not the only ERP value.
- Note: There is exactly one row with "erp w" = 2, but multiple other values exist; thus, 2 is not unique as the sole value in the column.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the fragment “the number 2 be the only erp w” as a data claim about column "erp w" in table public.whlp, meaning “2 is the only distinct value in that column.” If a different interpretation was intended (e.g., a question about primes or another domain), the above verification specifically addresses the public.whlp dataset available here.
