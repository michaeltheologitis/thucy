Claim to verify: “The Westgaard Bridge is a Pratt pony through truss bridge in Traill County.”

Findings based on the data:
- Design/type: Supported. The database lists Westgaard Bridge with type “Pratt pony through truss.”
- Location/county: Contradicted. The database places Westgaard Bridge in McHenry County (near Voltaire), not Traill County. No record exists for a Westgaard Bridge in Traill County, and a list of bridges in Traill County does not include Westgaard Bridge.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate any Westgaard-related entries and return full details
- Result:
  - Name: westgaard bridge
  - County: mchenry
  - Location: voltaire
  - Listed: 1997 - 02 - 27
  - Type: pratt pony through truss
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, county, location, listed, type 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%westgaard%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%westgard%'

2) Check for any Westgaard entry in Traill County
- Result: No rows returned (no Westgaard-related entry in Traill County).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, county FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Westgaard%' AND county = 'Traill';

3) Confirm the details for Westgaard Bridge by exact name (case-insensitive)
- Result:
  - Name: Westgaard Bridge
  - County: McHenry
  - Location: Voltaire
  - Listed: 1997-02-27
  - Type: Pratt pony through truss
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, county, location, listed, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('Westgaard Bridge');

4) Bridges in Traill County (for context; Westgaard Bridge not present)
- Result (selection):
  - Caledonia Bridge — Pratt Through Truss
  - Norway Bridge — Pratt Pony Truss
  - Viking Bridge — Pratt Through Truss
  - Blanchard Bridge — Pratt Through Truss
  - Goose River Bridge — Pratt Through Truss
  - Porter Elliott Bridge — Warren Through Truss
  - Portland Park Bridge — Steel Through Girder
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, type FROM public.my_info_table WHERE county ILIKE '%Traill%';

Conclusion:
- The design/type portion (“Pratt pony through truss”) is supported by the data.
- The location (“in Traill County”) is contradicted by the data; the bridge is recorded in McHenry County (Voltaire).

Assumptions:
- The table public.my_info_table is the authoritative source for bridge records including name, county, location, and type.
- “Traill County” is spelled exactly as shown in the data; alternate spellings were not present beyond the explicit checks performed.
- Variant spellings searched for the name included “Westgaard” and “Westgard.”
