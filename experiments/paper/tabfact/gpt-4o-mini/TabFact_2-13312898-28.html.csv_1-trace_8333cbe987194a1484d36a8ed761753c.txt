Claim to verify: “Wes Roberts was picked by the Indianapolis Colts before Ed Whitley was chosen.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history

Schema details (from data source)
- Table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  - Columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify rows for both players and retrieve full details
SQL:
SELECT name, round, pick, overall, position, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%wes%' OR name ILIKE '%whitley%';
Result:
- Wes Roberts — Round: 7, Pick: 5, Overall: 170, Position: Defensive End, College: TCU
- Ed Whitley — Round: 11, Pick: 3, Overall: 280, Position: Tight End, College: Kansas State

2) Confirm ordering by overall pick to determine who was selected earlier
SQL:
SELECT name, overall FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE 'Wes Roberts' OR name ILIKE 'Ed Whitley' ORDER BY overall ASC;
Result (ordered by overall ascending):
- Wes Roberts — Overall: 170
- Ed Whitley — Overall: 280

Assessment
- Both players appear in the Indianapolis Colts draft history table.
- Wes Roberts’ overall pick (170) is lower than Ed Whitley’s (280), meaning Roberts was selected earlier in the draft than Whitley.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data: Wes Roberts was picked by the Indianapolis Colts before Ed Whitley was chosen.

Assumptions
- “Before” refers to earlier selection as indicated by a lower overall pick number within the draft represented by the table.
- The table comprehensively reflects Colts draft selections such that comparing overall pick numbers accurately represents selection order.
- Player names are matched exactly as listed in the data (case-insensitive).
