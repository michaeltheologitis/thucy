Claim to verify: "Lukáš Melich won a medal at the Olympic Games."

Data discovery and structure:
- Available database: public
- Table: public.luk_melich
  - Columns: year (bigint), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text)

Evidence 1: Retrieve all Olympic Games entries for Lukáš Melich and check for medal positions (1st/2nd/3rd)
SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes,
       CASE WHEN position IN ('1st','2nd','3rd') THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS is_medal
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE competition ILIKE '%Olympic%'
ORDER BY year;
Result:
- 2008 | Olympic Games | Beijing, PR China | 29th | 70.56 m | is_medal = FALSE
- 2012 | Olympic Games | London, Great Britain | 6th | 77.17 m | is_medal = FALSE
Interpretation: No Olympic entries show a medal position.

Evidence 2: Direct count of Olympic medals (positions 1–3)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE competition ILIKE '%Olympic%'
  AND position IN ('1st','2nd','3rd');
Result: row_count = 0
Interpretation: The database records zero Olympic medals for Lukáš Melich.

Context check (non-Olympic medal shown in the dataset)
SQL:
SELECT competition, venue, position, notes
FROM public.luk_melich
WHERE year = 2013;
Result:
- Competition: World Championships | Venue: Moscow, Russia | Position: 3rd | Notes: 79.36 m
Interpretation: The dataset shows a World Championships bronze in 2013, which is not an Olympic medal.

Conclusion:
- The data shows Lukáš Melich competed at the Olympic Games in 2008 and 2012 without winning a medal. Therefore, the claim that he won a medal at the Olympic Games is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- "Win a medal" is interpreted as finishing 1st, 2nd, or 3rd.
- "Olympic game" refers to the Olympic Games competitions listed in the competition field containing the term 'Olympic'.
