Claim interpreted: “The actor who plays the character Ariadne Oliver is Hugh Fraser.”

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes
- Relevant columns: actor (text), character (text), title / rank (text), series (text), years (text)

Evidence:
1) Identify the actor for character “Ariadne Oliver” (normalized)
SQL:
SELECT actor, character FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE LOWER(TRIM(character)) = 'ariadne oliver'
Result:
- actor: Zoë Wanamaker; character: Ariadne Oliver

2) Identify the character(s) played by actor “Hugh Fraser” (normalized)
SQL:
SELECT actor, character FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes WHERE LOWER(actor) = 'hugh fraser';
Result:
- actor: Hugh Fraser; character: Arthur Hastings

3) Cross-check via case-insensitive keyword search for relevant names
SQL:
SELECT actor, character, series FROM public.list_of_agatha_christie_s_poirot_episodes
WHERE LOWER(actor) LIKE ANY (ARRAY[LOWER('%Ariadne%'), LOWER('%Oliver%'), LOWER('%Zoe%'), LOWER('%Wanamaker%'), LOWER('%Hugh Fraser%')])
OR LOWER(character) LIKE ANY (ARRAY[LOWER('%Ariadne%'), LOWER('%Oliver%'), LOWER('%Zoe%'), LOWER('%Wanamaker%'), LOWER('%Hugh Fraser%')]);
Results include:
- actor: Zoë Wanamaker; character: Ariadne Oliver; series: 10 - 13
- actor: Hugh Fraser; character: Arthur Hastings; series: 1 - 8, 13

Conclusion:
- The data shows Ariadne Oliver is portrayed by Zoë Wanamaker, not Hugh Fraser. Hugh Fraser portrays Arthur Hastings.

Assumptions made:
- The user’s phrasing was interpreted as a claim about the actor for the character “Ariadne Oliver” in Agatha Christie’s Poirot adaptations contained in the provided dataset.
