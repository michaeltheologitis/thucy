Claim interpreted: “No player in the running back position was picked after the 10th round.” We verify this against the available data source: Indianapolis Colts draft history (table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history).

Data exploration and checks
1) Identify how the position is stored and confirm presence of running back entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT position, LENGTH(position) AS len FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history ORDER BY position;
- Result excerpt (positions stored in lowercase):
  - running back (12 chars)
  - fullback, wide receiver, tight end, cornerback, etc.

2) List all drafted “running back” entries to see their rounds
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, round, pick, overall, position FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(position) = 'running back' ORDER BY round, overall, name;
- Result:
  - Curtis Dickey — Round 1, Pick 5, Overall 5, Position: Running Back
  - Mark Bright — Round 9, Pick 6, Overall 227, Position: Running Back

3) Aggregate verification for running backs: count after 10th round, min/max round
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS rb_after_10 FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(position) = 'running back' AND round > 10;
- Result: 0

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(round) AS min_round_rb, MAX(round) AS max_round_rb, COUNT(*) AS count_rb FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE lower(position) = 'running back';
- Result: min_round_rb = 1, max_round_rb = 9, count_rb = 2

Conclusion
- Within the Indianapolis Colts draft history dataset, no player listed at the running back position was drafted after the 10th round (maximum RB round observed is 9). The claim holds true for this data source.

Assumptions
- “Running back” is interpreted as rows where lower(position) = 'running back'. Related positions such as fullback are treated as distinct and not included.
- Verification is scoped to the available dataset (Indianapolis Colts draft history), not the entire NFL or other teams.
