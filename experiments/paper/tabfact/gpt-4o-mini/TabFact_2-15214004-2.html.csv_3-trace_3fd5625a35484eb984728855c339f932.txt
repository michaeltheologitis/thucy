Claim to verify: “peter lowry’s pick number be 25.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table t_2008_mls_superdraft, which lists players selected in the 2008 MLS SuperDraft.
- Verified table structure:
  - Columns: pick (bigint), "mls team" (text), player (text), position (text), affiliation (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial exact-match lookup (no rows returned due to case sensitivity or formatting):
   SQL:
   SELECT pick, "mls team" FROM t_2008_mls_superdraft WHERE player = 'Peter Lowry';

2) Case-insensitive exact-name lookup (returned result):
   Result: Peter Lowry was picked 26th by Chicago Fire.
   SQL:
   SELECT pick, "mls team" FROM public.t_2008_mls_superdraft WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Peter Lowry');

3) Case-insensitive substring lookup to confirm full row details:
   Result:
   - Player: Peter Lowry
   - Pick: 26
   - MLS Team: Chicago Fire
   - Position: M / F
   - Affiliation: Santa Clara San Jose Frogs
   SQL:
   SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_mls_superdraft WHERE player ILIKE '%Lowry%';

Conclusion
- The authoritative 2008 MLS SuperDraft table shows Peter Lowry was selected with pick number 26 by the Chicago Fire. The claim that his pick number was 25 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2008 MLS SuperDraft (the available, authoritative dataset). No other drafts or contexts were specified by the user.
