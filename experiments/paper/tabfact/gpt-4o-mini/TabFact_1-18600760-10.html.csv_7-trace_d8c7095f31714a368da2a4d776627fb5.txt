Summary
- Claim assessed: “the geo id for dickey county be 3804740620.”
- Data sources explored: TabFact database, public schema, table: list_of_townships_in_north_dakota.
- Finding: The GEOID 3804740620 in the available dataset corresponds to Logan County (township: Janke), not Dickey County. No record associates 3804740620 with Dickey County.

Data source discovery
- Available database and table:
  • Database: TabFact (Table-Based Fact Verification)
  • Schema: public
  • Table: list_of_townships_in_north_dakota

Schema details and sample
- Columns (from information_schema): ansi code (bigint), water (sqmi) (double precision), latitude (double precision), geo id (bigint), pop (2010) (bigint), land ( sqmi ) (double precision), county (text), longitude (text), township (text)
- Sample (first 10 rows) includes entries for multiple counties with their “geo id”. Notably:
  • dickey — james river valley — geo id: 3802140540
  • logan — janke — geo id: 3804740620

Targeted verification queries and results
1) What county/township has geo id = 3804740620?
SQL:
SELECT county, township, "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE "geo id" = 3804740620;
Result:
- County: Logan; Township: Janke; Geo ID: 3804740620

2) Is there any row where county = 'dickey' and geo id = 3804740620?
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county = 'dickey' AND "geo id" = 3804740620;
Result:
- No rows found

3) Example of a Dickey County entry and its geo id
SQL:
SELECT township, "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county='dickey' LIMIT 10;
Result:
- Township: James River Valley; Geo ID: 3802140540

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that GEOID 3804740620 corresponds to Logan County (township: Janke), not Dickey County. Therefore, the claim that “the geo id for dickey county be 3804740620” is not supported by the data and is incorrect in this data context.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “geo id” as the GEOID field present in the table list_of_townships_in_north_dakota, which appears to represent township-level (minor civil division) GEOIDs within North Dakota counties.
- Interpreted “dickey county” as the county named Dickey in North Dakota, matching rows where county = 'dickey'.
