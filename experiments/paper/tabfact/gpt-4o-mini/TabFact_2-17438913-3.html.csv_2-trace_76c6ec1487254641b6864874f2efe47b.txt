Scope and data source
- Available data source: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (Rangers FC 2008–2009 season transfer records). Columns: nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee".

Evidence 1: Identify relevant transfer type values
- Purpose: Confirm whether a transfer category exists that explicitly denotes end-of-contract moves.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT type FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
- Result (distinct types observed): Loan; End of Contract; Transfer.

Evidence 2: Count transfers that are specifically end-of-contract
- Purpose: Determine the count of players whose transfer type indicates End of Contract.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result: 7 rows.

Evidence 3: List the affected players for verification
- Purpose: Verify the individual records corresponding to the count.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  WHERE LOWER(TRIM(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result (7 players):
  1) Nicholas Gallacher — Moving to: Motherwell — Transfer Window: Summer
  2) Lacine Cherif — Moving to: Kilmarnock — Transfer Window: Summer
  3) Alistair Park — Moving to: Hibernian — Transfer Window: Summer
  4) Michael Donald — Moving to: Free Agent — Transfer Window: Summer
  5) Calum Reidford — Moving to: Dunfermline Athletic — Transfer Window: Summer
  6) Chris Smith — Moving to: Greenock Morton — Transfer Window: Summer
  7) Jeroen van den Broeck — Moving to: Agovv — Transfer Window: Summer

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 7 players categorized with transfer type End of Contract. This supports the claim that only 7 players were transferred at the end of their contract (within this dataset’s scope).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available data source (Rangers FC 2008–2009) and mapped “transferred at the end of their contract” to rows where type = End of Contract (case/whitespace normalized).
