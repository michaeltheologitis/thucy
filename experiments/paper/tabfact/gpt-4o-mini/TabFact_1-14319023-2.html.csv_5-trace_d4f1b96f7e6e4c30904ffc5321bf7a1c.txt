What I checked
- The claim states that in 2010 the girls’ doubles champions were Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia, and the boys’ doubles champions were Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.
- I verified 2010 winners in the authoritative table public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships.

Data source structure (validated before querying)
- Columns and data types in public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships:
  - year (bigint)
  - boys singles (text)
  - girls singles (text)
  - boys doubles (text)
  - girls doubles (text)

- Row count: 10 rows

SQL used to validate structure
1) Columns and data types
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'indonesian_national_badminton_championships';

2) Row count
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships;

Evidence for 2010 winners
- Retrieved girls doubles and boys doubles for 2010; confirmed exactly one row for that year.

SQL used and results
1) Get 2010 winners (girls doubles and boys doubles)
SELECT "girls doubles", "boys doubles"

SELECT *
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships

Cross-check for the claimed girls’ pair
- I searched for occurrences of the names “ayu”, “pratiwi”, “anggi”, “widia” in girls doubles across all years.

SQL used
SELECT year, "girls doubles"
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE "girls doubles" ILIKE '%ayu%'
   OR "girls doubles" ILIKE '%pratiwi%'
   OR "girls doubles" ILIKE '%anggi%'
   OR "girls doubles" ILIKE '%widia%';
Result:
- 2009: girls doubles contains Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia

Direct retrieval for 2009 girls’ doubles
SQL used
SELECT "girls doubles"
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships
WHERE year = 2009;
Result:
- Girls Doubles (2009): Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia

Conclusion
- Boys doubles (2010): Claim is supported. The database lists “jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita,” i.e., Jones Ralfy Jansen and Dandi Prabudita.
- Girls doubles (2010): Claim is not supported. The database shows Aris Budiharti and Dian Fitriani as the 2010 girls’ doubles champions. Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia appear as girls’ doubles champions in 2009, not 2010.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Indonesian National Badminton Championships categories labeled “boys” and “girls,” and the year in question is 2010 as stated. Names are interpreted as pairs listed in the corresponding text fields.
