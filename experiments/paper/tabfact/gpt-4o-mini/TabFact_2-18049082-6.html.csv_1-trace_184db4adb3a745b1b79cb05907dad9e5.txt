Claim to verify: “Danish Thomas Bjørn rank lower than Tiger Wood(s).”

Available data sources explored
- The only accessible dataset is a PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: public.t_1998_open_championship.
- Table structure was confirmed prior to querying.

Evidence collected
1) Table structure (for context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1998_open_championship' AND table_schema = 'public';

Result (summary): columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text).

2) Player finishing positions (1998 Open Championship)
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" 
FROM public.t_1998_open_championship 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Woods%' OR player ILIKE '%Thomas%' OR player ILIKE '%Bj%';

Results:
- Player: tiger woods | Place: t6 | Country: united states | Score: 65 + 73 + 77 = 215 | To Par: + 5
- Player: thomas bjãrn | Place: t6 | Country: denmark | Score: 68 + 71 + 76 = 215 | To Par: + 5

Analysis
- The dataset shows both Tiger Woods and Thomas Bjørn (listed as “thomas bjãrn,” country: denmark) finished tied for 6th (T6) in the 1998 Open Championship.
- Therefore, within this dataset, Thomas Bjørn did not rank lower than Tiger Woods; they had the same finishing position.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the available evidence in the dataset: in the 1998 Open Championship, both golfers were T6.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “rank lower” as referring to finishing position in the only available dataset (1998 Open Championship), since no broader ranking data (e.g., OWGR) is present in the accessible sources.
- Interpreted “Tiger Wood” as Tiger Woods.
- Confirmed “Danish Thomas Bjørn” via the country field (denmark) in the dataset.
