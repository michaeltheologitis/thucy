Summary of the claim
User claim: “Guillaume Gillet scored 3 times as much as each of the other 2 players in the UEFA Champions League tournament.”

What the data covers
- Available authoritative data source: a single PostgreSQL table for R.S.C. Anderlecht’s 2008–09 season (public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season). This table contains per-player season totals and counts for several domestic competitions but has no field for the UEFA Champions League specifically.

Step 1 — Verify available columns (to check for any Champions League field)
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 't_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

Result (columns):
- player (text)
- league (bigint)
- title playoff (bigint)
- super cup (bigint)
- total (bigint)

Finding: There is no column that isolates UEFA Champions League statistics. Therefore, within this dataset, we cannot directly verify a Champions League-specific scoring comparison.

Step 2 — Retrieve Guillaume Gillet’s recorded season totals in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total 
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
WHERE player = 'guillaume gillet';

Result:
- player: guillaume gillet; league: 8; title playoff: 0; super cup: 0; total: 9

Step 3 — Check the “3 times as much” ratio against other players (within the available season totals)
Executed SQL (find players whose total × 3 equals Gillet’s total):
-- Get Gillet’s total
SELECT total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player = 'guillaume gillet';

-- Find players with total × 3 = Gillet’s total
SELECT player, total 
FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
WHERE total * 3 = (SELECT total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player = 'guillaume gillet');

Results:
- Players with total = 3: Lucas Biglia (3), Dmitri Bulykin (3), Jan Polák (3), Matías Suárez (3), Jelle Van Damme (3)
- Guillaume Gillet’s total = 9
- Therefore, for at least five players in this dataset, Gillet’s season total (9) equals 3 × 3.

Assessment vs. the claim
- Champions League context: The dataset has no Champions League-specific field, so the claim “in the UEFA Champions League tournament” cannot be verified from the available data. This is a critical mismatch with the claim’s main context.
- Ratio element: Within the available season totals (not Champions League-specific), Guillaume Gillet’s total (9) is indeed exactly 3× the totals of several teammates who each have 3. This supports the “3 times as much” ratio element within overall season totals—but it does not demonstrate anything about Champions League performance.

Conclusion
- The central Champions League-specific part of the claim is unsupported by the available authoritative data. While the 3× ratio holds for overall season totals against multiple players, the dataset does not allow verification of this ratio within the UEFA Champions League.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguous phrasing and limited data scope)
- Interpreted “score 3 times as much” as goal totals in the dataset’s context.
- Treated the presence of multiple players with total = 3 as satisfying the “other 2 players” phrasing for the ratio check, but only in overall season totals, not Champions League.
- No extrapolation beyond the available table, as there is no Champions League-specific data here.
