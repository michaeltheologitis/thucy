Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there exists a year where the girls’ doubles pair is “ayu pratiwi anggi widia” and the boys’ doubles pair is “jones ralfy jansen and dandi prabudita.” I verify this against the Indonesian National Badminton Championships data.

Data source used: TabFact database, schema public, table indonesian_national_badminton_championships (columns: year, boys singles, girls singles, boys doubles, girls doubles, mixed doubles).

Evidence
1) Locate entries featuring the boys’ pair including Jones/Dandi
SQL executed:
SELECT "year", "boys doubles", "girls doubles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE "boys doubles" ILIKE '%Jones%' 
   OR "boys doubles" ILIKE '%Jansen%' 
   OR "boys doubles" ILIKE '%Dandi%';
Results:
- Year: 2009 | Boys Doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita | Girls Doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia
- Year: 2010 | Boys Doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita | Girls Doubles: aris budiharti dian fitriani

2) Retrieve exact 2009 winners’ text
SQL executed:
SELECT "boys doubles", "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
Results:
- Boys Doubles: jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita
- Girls Doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia

3) Confirm girls’ doubles pair occurrence
SQL executed:
SELECT year, "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls doubles" LIKE '%ayu pratiwi anggi widia%'
Result:
- Year: 2009 | girls doubles: ayu pratiwi anggi widia

Conclusion
The data show that in 2009 the girls’ doubles champions are recorded as “ayu pratiwi anggi widia” and the boys’ doubles champions as “jones ralfy jansen dandi prabudita.” This matches the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- “girl double” and “boy double” refer to girls’ doubles and boys’ doubles champions in the Indonesian National Badminton Championships dataset.
- Name formatting and capitalization are taken as stored in the dataset (all-lowercase concatenated full names).
