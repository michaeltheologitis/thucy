Claim to verify: “the maximum number of 2006 subscriber for mobilis be 7476 at egypt.”

Summary of findings
- The dataset shows Mobilis with 7,476 (thousands) subscribers in 2006 in Algeria, not Egypt.
- This 7,476 (thousands) figure is the maximum 2006 subscriber count for Mobilis in the dataset (and the only Mobilis entry found), but it is associated with Algeria.
- No Mobilis entry is associated with Egypt in the dataset.

Evidence from data and executed SQL
1) List all entries for provider Mobilis and their 2006 subscribers
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" AS subs2006 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa 
WHERE lower(provider) = 'mobilis' 
ORDER BY subs2006 DESC;

Result returned by the tool:
- Provider: Mobilis; Country: Algeria; Subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476

2) Confirm the maximum 2006 subscribers for Mobilis and its country
Executed SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa 
WHERE lower(provider) = 'mobilis' 
AND "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" = (SELECT MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)") 
                                           FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa 
                                           WHERE lower(provider) = 'mobilis');

Result returned by the tool:
- Provider: mobilis; Country: Algeria; Subscribers (2006) (thousands): 7476

Assessment
- Correct elements: The maximum 2006 subscribers value for Mobilis is 7,476 (thousands).
- Incorrect element: The country is Algeria, not Egypt. The dataset does not show Mobilis for Egypt.

Assumptions made
- “subscriber for mobilis” refers to the provider field exactly matching “Mobilis”.
- “2006 subscriber” refers to the column “subscribers (2006) (thousands)”.
- “maximum” is interpreted as the maximum 2006 value for rows where provider = Mobilis in the dataset.
