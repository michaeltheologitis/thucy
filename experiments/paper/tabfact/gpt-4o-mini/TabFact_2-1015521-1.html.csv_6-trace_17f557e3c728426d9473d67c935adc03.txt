Summary of data environment explored
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with a single table: uruguayan_air_force, containing columns: aircraft (text), origin (text), type (text), versions (text), in service (text). This dataset is treated as authoritative for verification.

Claim analyzed
- Interpreted claim: “The Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia is from Switzerland and is a transport/utility type aircraft.”

Evidence gathered
1) Presence of Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia entry and its origin/type
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT aircraft, origin, type FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%Embraer EMB 120%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%Brasilia%';
- Result (as returned):
  aircraft: embraer emb 120 brasilia; origin: brazil; type: transport

- Executed SQL (full row confirmation):
  SELECT * FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%EMB 120%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%Brasilia%';
- Result (as returned):
  aircraft: embraer emb 120 brasilia; origin: Brazil; type: Transport; versions: emb 120; in service: 1

Interpretation:
- The dataset lists the EMB 120 Brasilia as originating from Brazil and classifies it as Type: Transport.

2) Whether EMB 120 is classified as “utility” in this dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT aircraft, type FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE (aircraft ILIKE '%EMB 120%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%Brasilia%') AND type ILIKE '%utility%';
- Result: No rows returned.

Interpretation:
- In this dataset, the EMB 120 is not labeled with “utility” in its type.

3) Context: How the dataset uses “utility” for other aircraft
- Executed SQL (count of entries whose type includes ‘utility’):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS aircraft_count FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE type ILIKE '%utility%';
- Result: 6

- Executed SQL (examples):
  SELECT aircraft, type FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE type ILIKE '%utility%' LIMIT 5;
- Results (examples as returned):
  - Lockheed C - 130 Hercules — Type: Transport / Utility
  - Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante — Type: Transport / Utility
  - Beechcraft Twin Bonanza — Type: Transport / Utility
  - Cessna 206 Stationair — Type: Utility / Liaison
  - Bell 212 Twin Huey — Type: Transport / Utility

Interpretation:
- The table does use a “Transport / Utility” classification for some aircraft, but the Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia entry is specifically labeled “Transport” only.

Conclusions
- “From Switzerland”: Contradicted by the data. The origin recorded is Brazil.
- “Transport/utility type aircraft”: Partly contradicted. The dataset classifies the EMB 120 as “Transport” (not “Transport / Utility”).
- Therefore, the claim as stated is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- “From Switzerland” was interpreted as country of origin (manufacturer/origin nation), not an operator’s nationality. The dataset provides an origin field which we used for this determination.
- Verification is grounded solely in the available uruguayan_air_force dataset, treated as authoritative within scope.
