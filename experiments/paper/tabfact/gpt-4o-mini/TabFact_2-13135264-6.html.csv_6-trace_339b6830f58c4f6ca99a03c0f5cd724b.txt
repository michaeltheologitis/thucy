Conclusion: The data show Detroit did not tie for the highest home team score; Detroit uniquely holds the highest home team score in this dataset (6 goals).

What I checked and found:
- I parsed the score field (format: 'visitor_goals - home_goals') to compute home-team goals for every game in the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season table.
- The maximum number of goals scored by the home team in any game in this table is 6, and it occurred only once—with Detroit as the home team on January 5 vs. Nashville.
- Because only one game reached the maximum (6), there was no tie for the highest home team score.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Maximum home-team goals across all games in the table
SQL:
SELECT MAX(split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int) AS max_home_goals
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
Result: max_home_goals = 6

2) All games where home-team goals equal that maximum
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int = 6;
Result (1 row):
- date: January 5; visitor: Nashville; score: 0 - 6; home: Detroit

3) Count of games that reached the maximum home-team goals
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int = 6;
Result: count_rows = 1

4) Top home-goal games (for context)
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int AS home_goals, score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
ORDER BY home_goals DESC, date
LIMIT 10;
Selected results excerpt (ordered by home_goals desc):
- January 5: home=Detroit, visitor=Nashville, home_goals=6, score=0 - 6
- January 24: home=Phoenix, visitor=Detroit, home_goals=5, score=2 - 5
- January 29: home=Detroit, visitor=New Jersey, home_goals=5, score=2 - 5
(no other game reached 6 home goals)

Final assessment: There is no tie for the highest home team score in this dataset; Detroit alone achieved the season’s highest home-team tally (6) on January 5 vs. Nashville.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available dataset: the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season table. 
- “Home team score” means the number of goals scored by the home team in a given game, parsed as the second number in the 'score' column ('visitor - home').
- “Tie for the highest” means more than one game/team sharing the same maximum home-team goals within this dataset.
