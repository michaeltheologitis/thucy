Summary conclusion: The claim that August 31, 1947 was the date of the last game of the season is contradicted by the data. In the available dataset for the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season, August 31, 1947 is the first game (Week 1). The last game is dated December 7, 1947 (Week 14).

Evidence from data
1) Identify available tables
- Result: public schema contains t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
- Executed SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

2) Inspect table structure
- Result: Columns = week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), score (text), record (text). No primary key.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season' 
AND table_schema = 'public';

SELECT a.attname AS column_name 
FROM pg_index i 
JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attnum = ANY(i.indkey) 
JOIN pg_class c ON c.oid = i.indrelid 
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace 
WHERE i.indisprimary 
AND c.relname = 't_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season' 
AND n.nspname = 'public';

3) Retrieve the 1947 schedule
- Result (selected rows):
  • Week 1: Date = August 31, 1947; Opponent = Brooklyn Dodgers; Result = W 23-7; Record after game = 1-0.
  • ...
  • Week 14: Date = December 7, 1947; Opponent = Buffalo Bills; Result = T 21-21; Record after game = 8-4-2.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY week ASC;

Analysis
- The dataset shows the season starts on August 31, 1947 (Week 1) and ends on December 7, 1947 (Week 14). Therefore, August 31, 1947 is not the last game date; it is the first.

Assumptions
- “The season” is interpreted as the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season represented by the table public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season.
- The last game of the season is the final listed week (Week 14) in this dataset.
