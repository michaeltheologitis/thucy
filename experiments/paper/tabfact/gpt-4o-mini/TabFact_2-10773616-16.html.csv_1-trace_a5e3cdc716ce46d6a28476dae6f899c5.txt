Claim interpreted: “Melbourne is the team with the highest away team score.” We verify this against the 1954 VFL season match dataset available in the database.

Data source overview
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1954_vfl_season (columns: "home team" text, "home team score" text, "away team" text, "away team score" text, venue text, crowd bigint, date text). Scores are stored as strings in the format goals.behinds (total), e.g., 15.4 (94), where the number inside parentheses is the total points.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine the maximum total points scored by an away team (parse the number inside parentheses):
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS max_away_total FROM t_1954_vfl_season;
Result:
- max_away_total = 94

2) Retrieve the match(es) where the away total equals that maximum:
SQL:
SELECT "away team", CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) AS away_score, "home team", venue, date 
FROM t_1954_vfl_season 
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) = (
  SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) 
  FROM t_1954_vfl_season
);
Result:
- Away Team: Melbourne; Away Score: 94; Home Team: Richmond; Venue: Punt Road Oval; Date: 14 August 1954

3) Count how many matches achieved that maximum and list distinct away teams at that maximum:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count, ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT "away team") AS distinct_teams 
FROM t_1954_vfl_season 
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER) = (
  SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) 
  FROM t_1954_vfl_season
);
Result:
- match_count = 1; distinct_teams = {"Melbourne"}

Conclusion
- The highest away team total in the dataset is 94 points, achieved by Melbourne (away) vs Richmond at Punt Road Oval on 14 August 1954. No other away team matched or exceeded this total in the dataset.
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Highest away team score” refers to the single-game maximum total points scored by an away team within the available dataset (1954 VFL season results).
- “Melbourne” refers to the Melbourne Football Club in the VFL context.
