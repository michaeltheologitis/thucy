Summary
Claim: “9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table.”
Conclusion: Supported by the data in the salmson database. The row named “9 adr” has bore exactly “mm (in)”, and every row in the table has the same bore value.

Data source exploration
- Available data source discovered: PostgreSQL database ‘salmson’ (public schema).
- Relevant table: salmson with columns: name (text), cyl (text), bore (text), capacity (text), power (text), weight (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify the “9 adr” row and its bore value
- Result: One row matched. Name: 9 adr; Bore: mm (in); Cyl: 9 - cyl radial; Capacity: l (cuin); Power: at 2700 rpm; Weight: weight kg (lb)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM salmson WHERE name ILIKE '%ADR%' OR name ILIKE '%adr%';

2) Verify that every other row has the same bore value
- Results:
  - Total rows in table: 12
  - Rows with bore exactly 'mm (in)': 12
  - Distinct bore values with counts: 'mm (in)': 12
- SQL executed:
  -- Total rows
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM salmson;
  -- Rows with bore 'mm (in)'
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS mm_in_rows FROM salmson WHERE bore = 'mm (in)';
  -- Distinct bore values and their counts
  SELECT bore, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM salmson GROUP BY bore;

Findings
- The “9 adr” entry has bore “mm (in)”.
- All entries in the table have bore “mm (in)”.
- Therefore, the claim that “9 adr have a bore of mm (in) just like every other bore in the table” is fully supported.

Assumptions
- “the table” refers to the salmson.public.salmson table discovered in the available data source.
- “9 adr” refers to the row where name = '9 adr'.
- The phrase “bore of mm (in)” is taken literally as the string value “mm (in)” in the bore field, as stored in the data.
