Claim interpreted: The user asserts that a second leg ended 3 - 0 in a case where San Pedro were the 2nd-place team (runner-up).

Data source overview:
- Database: copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty (public schema)
- Table: copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty
  - Columns: year, winner, runners - up, aggregate, 1st leg, 2nd leg

Evidence collected:
1) Check if San Pedro ever appears as runner-up
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, winner, "runners - up", "1st leg", "2nd leg", aggregate 
FROM copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty 
WHERE lower("runners - up") LIKE '%san pedro%';
- Result: No matching rows were found (San Pedro does not appear as runner-up in this dataset).

2) List all rows to confirm San Pedro’s role when present
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, winner, "runners - up", "1st leg", "2nd leg", aggregate 
FROM copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty 
ORDER BY year ASC;
- Key observations from results:
  - 1984: winner = san pedro; runners-up = rocha; 1st leg = 1 - 3; 2nd leg = 3 - 0; aggregate = 4 - 3
  - San Pedro appears as winner (not runner-up) in the year where the 2nd leg ended 3 - 0.

3) Identify all cases where the 2nd leg was 3 - 0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "year", "winner", "runners - up", "1st leg", "2nd leg" 
FROM copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty 
WHERE "2nd leg" = '3 - 0';
- Results:
  - 1978: Winner = Federación Misionera; Runners-up = Melo; 1st leg = 1 - 0; 2nd leg = 3 - 0
  - 1984: Winner = San Pedro; Runners-up = Rocha; 1st leg = 1 - 3; 2nd leg = 3 - 0
- In neither case is San Pedro the runner-up; in 1984, San Pedro is explicitly the winner.

Conclusion:
- The data shows no instance where San Pedro was the runner-up (2nd place) and the second leg ended 3 - 0. The only match involving San Pedro with a 3 - 0 second leg (1984) has San Pedro as the winner, not runner-up. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “2nd place winner” is interpreted as “runner-up.”
- “San Pedro” is matched as a substring within the runners-up field (case-insensitive).
