Summary of the claim assessed:
- Interpreted claim: “The player born on 2 November 1987 is a fly-half, and is the only one for a Sale player.” I interpret this as asserting that the player born on 2 Nov 1987 is a fly-half and that this corresponds to the only Sale (Sale Sharks) player fitting that description.

Data source explored
- Available dataset: a PostgreSQL table public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads containing 2008 Six Nations Championship squad data (players, positions, dates of birth, and clubs/provinces).

Schema discovery (executed SQL and result)
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_2008_six_nations_championship_squads' 
AND table_schema = 'public';

Result (abridged):
- player (text)
- position (text)
- date of birth (age) (text)
- caps (bigint)
- club / province (text)

Evidence 1: Identify the player born on 2 November 1987
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "date of birth (age)", "club / province" 
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Cipriani%';

Result:
- Player: Danny Cipriani
- Position: Fly-half
- Date of Birth: 2 November 1987
- Club/Province: Wasps

Finding:
- The player born on 2 November 1987 in this dataset is Danny Cipriani, and his position is Fly-half. However, his club in the 2008 Six Nations squads is Wasps, not Sale.

Evidence 2: Which players in the dataset are associated with Sale, and are any a fly-half/born 2 Nov 1987?
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "date of birth (age)" AS age, "club / province" 
FROM public.t_2008_six_nations_championship_squads 
WHERE "club / province" ILIKE '%Sale%';

Results:
1) Andrew Sheridan — Prop — 1 November 1979 — Sale
2) Magnus Lund — Flanker — 25 June 1983 — Sale
3) Richard Wigglesworth — Scrum-half — 9 June 1983 — Sale
4) Charlie Hodgson — Fly-half — 12 November 1980 — Sale
5) Mark Cueto — Fullback — 26 December 1979 — Sale

Findings:
- The dataset lists multiple Sale players in 2008. The only Sale fly-half present is Charlie Hodgson (born 12 November 1980), not Danny Cipriani. No Sale player in this dataset matches the birthdate 2 November 1987.

Conclusion
- True: The player born on 2 November 1987 (Danny Cipriani) has position Fly-half.
- False: He is not the “only one for a Sale player”; in this dataset he is recorded with Wasps, and the Sale fly-half in the squads is Charlie Hodgson (born 1980), not Cipriani.

Overall assessment: The claim mixes a true statement about position and birthdate with an inaccurate association to Sale.

Assumptions made
- “bear 2 november 1987” interpreted as “born 2 November 1987.”
- “sale player” interpreted as a player whose club/province is Sale (Sale Sharks) in the 2008 Six Nations squads dataset.
- “the only 1” interpreted as “the only one among Sale players in this dataset.”
