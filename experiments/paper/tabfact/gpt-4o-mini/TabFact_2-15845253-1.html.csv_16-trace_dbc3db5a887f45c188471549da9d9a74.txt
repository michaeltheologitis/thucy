Claim to verify: "none of the viral disease have a spherical virion shape"

Data sources explored
- Connected database: TabFact (Table-based Fact Verification)
- Schema: public
- Table discovered: public.viral_disease with columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence collected
1) Count of records with spherical virion shape
- Result: 1 record matches
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count 
FROM public.viral_disease 
WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%spherical%';

2) Full row(s) where virion shape mentions spherical
- Result row:
  - family: unassigned
  - baltimore group: group v
  - envelopment: enveloped
  - virion shape: spherical
  - replication site: nucleus
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.viral_disease WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%spherical%';

Assessment
- The claim asserts that there are no viral diseases with spherical virion shape. The database contains at least one record where virion shape is recorded as spherical. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and interpretation
- Interpreted "viral disease" entries as represented by rows in public.viral_disease.
- Considered any occurrence of the term "spherical" in the virion shape field (case-insensitive) to qualify as a spherical virion shape.
