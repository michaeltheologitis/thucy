FROM media_in_kelowna 
WHERE owner ILIKE '%Vista Broadcast Group%';

Result:

- branding: 103.9 the juice
- frequency: 0 103.9 fm
- format: adult hits
- owner: vista broadcast group

Interpretation: The table lists a Kelowna station owned by Vista Broadcast Group whose format is explicitly "adult hits".

2) Corroborate with a count of Adult Hits entries under Vista Broadcast Group
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS station_count 
FROM media_in_kelowna 
WHERE owner ILIKE '%Vista Broadcast Group%' 
AND format ILIKE '%adult hit%';

Result:

Conclusion
