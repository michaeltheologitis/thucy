Claim: “mehgaon tie with datia to have the highest number of electorate in 2009.”

Findings from the data
- The available table (bhind_lok_sabha_constituency) contains constituency names and “number of electorates (2009)”.
- Mehgaon has 210,649 electorates (2009), Datia has 143,593. Mehgaon is the highest among actual constituencies; there is no tie with Datia.

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Full listing (to see rankings and values)
SQL:
SELECT name, district, "number of electorates (2009)"
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC;
Result excerpt:
- total : | total : | 1,371,252
- mehgaon | bhind   | 210,649
- lahar   | bhind   | 205,839
- bhind   | bhind   | 197,183
- ater    | bhind   | 177,334
- gohad   | bhind   | 166,893
- datia   | datia   | 143,593
- bhander | datia   | 139,600
- sewda   | datia   | 130,161

2) Identify the maximum among actual constituencies (excluding the total row) and who holds it
SQL to compute max (excluding total row):
SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") AS max_electorates
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE name <> 'total :' AND district <> 'total :'
Result: 210649

SQL to list constituencies with that maximum:
SELECT name, district
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
WHERE "number of electorates (2009)" = 210649 AND name <> 'total :' AND district <> 'total:'
Result: mehgaon | bhind

3) Direct check for Mehgaon and Datia
SQL:
SELECT name, district, "number of electorates (2009)" 
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
WHERE name IN ('mehgaon', 'datia') 
ORDER BY name;
Results:
- datia | datia | 143,593
- mehgaon | bhind | 210,649

Conclusion
- Mehgaon alone has the highest electorate in 2009 among the listed constituencies. Datia’s electorate is lower, and there is no tie. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Electorate in 2009” refers to the column “number of electorates (2009)” in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table. 
- The “total :” row is a summary and not an individual constituency and was excluded when determining the highest among constituencies.
