Claim to verify:
"the black knights' record be 2 - 2 when they score 54 point against lehigh on september 20th"

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1975_army_cadets_football_team (columns: game, date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record)

Method:
- Look up the Army team’s game where they scored 54 points and identify opponent, date, and the recorded team record after that game.

Evidence:
1) Locate any game with 54 points scored
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record 
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team 
WHERE "black knights points" = 54;

Result:
- Game: 2
- Date: Sept 20
- Opponent: Lehigh
- Result: Win
- Black Knights Points: 54
- Opponents: 32
- Record: 2 - 0

2) Retrieve the full row for game 2 to confirm
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team WHERE game = 2;

Result:
- Game: 2
- Date: Sept 20
- Opponent: Lehigh
- Result: Win
- Black Knights Points: 54
- Opponents Points: 32
- Record: 2 - 0

Conclusion:
The data shows that when Army (Black Knights/Cadets) scored 54 points against Lehigh on Sept 20, their record was 2 - 0, not 2 - 2. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- "Black Knights" refers to the Army football team (listed as Army Cadets in the 1975 table).
- "September 20th" corresponds to the date value shown as "Sept 20" in the dataset.
- The "record" field represents the team’s overall record immediately after that game.
