Scope and data discovery
- Available data sources: A single public table related to Kentucky Wildcats football (1947 season).
  - Evidence (list tables)
    - Result: public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
    - SQL: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' ORDER BY table_name;
- Table structure (selected columns)
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), wildcats points (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)
  - SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team' AND table_schema = 'public';

2) Direct test of the claim (losses with Wildcats points > 7)
- Result: 0 games
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses_count FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE lower(result) = 'loss' AND "wildcats points" > 7;

3) Explicit list of losses and points

  - Ole Miss — Wildcats Points: 7 — Opponent Points: 14
  - 18 Alabama — Wildcats Points: 0 — Opponent Points: 13
  - Tennessee — Wildcats Points: 6 — Opponent Points: 13
- SQL: SELECT opponent, "wildcats points", opponents FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(result) = 'loss';

Conclusion
- In the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football season (the available dataset), the team never scored more than 7 points in any game they lost. The maximum points scored in losses were 7, with other losses at 0 and 6. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data available here.
