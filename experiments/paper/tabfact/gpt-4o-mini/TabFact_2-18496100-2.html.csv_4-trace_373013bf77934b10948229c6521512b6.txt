Claim: “Datia’s constituency number is higher than Gohad’s by 9.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Available table: bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
- Columns: 
  - "constituency number" (text)
  - "name" (text)
  - "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" (text)
  - "district" (text)
  - "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Listing constituency records (to verify presence and numbers for Datia and Gohad)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "constituency number", district, "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" AS reservation_status FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- gohad | 13 | bhind | sc
- datia | 22 | datia | none

2) Direct computation of the difference (Datia − Gohad)
Executed SQL:
SELECT 
    CAST("constituency number" AS INTEGER) AS constituency_number, 
    (SELECT CAST("constituency number" AS INTEGER) FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE LOWER(name) = 'gohad') AS gohad_num,
    (CAST("constituency number" AS INTEGER) - (SELECT CAST("constituency number" AS INTEGER) FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE LOWER(name) = 'gohad')) AS difference 
FROM 
    bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
WHERE 
    LOWER(name) = 'datia';
Result:
- Datia constituency_number: 22
- Gohad gohad_num: 13
- Difference: 9

Conclusion
- Datia’s constituency number (22) is higher than Gohad’s (13) by 9. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Constituency number” refers to the field "constituency number" in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table.
- “Datia” and “Gohad” correspond to the rows with name values 'datia' and 'gohad' (case-insensitive match).
