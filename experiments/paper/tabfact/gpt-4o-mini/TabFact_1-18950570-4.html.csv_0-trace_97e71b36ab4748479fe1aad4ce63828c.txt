Claim to verify: “the total brazilian population for age 15 - 17 be 10357874.”

Data source discovery and structure
- Available data sources: A PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema.
- Table: my_info_table
  - Key columns (all text):
    - age group
    - brazil 100% (percent of the population)
    - white 47.73% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)
    - black 7.61% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)
    - yellow 1.09% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)
    - brown (multiracial) 43.13% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)
    - indians 0.43% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)
    - unspecified 0.0034%

Evidence gathered (with executed SQL)
1) Locate rows for relevant age groups to see if “15 - 17” exists and what values are present.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE "age group" LIKE '%15%' OR "age group" LIKE '%16%' OR "age group" LIKE '%17%'
- Result (excerpt):
  - Age Group: 15 - 17
    - Brazil 100%: 10,357,874
    - White: 4,390,760; Black: 764,245; Yellow: 105,554; Brown: 5,045,778; Indians: 51,367; Unspecified: 170
  - Age Group: 15 - 19 (also present, but not the target range)

2) Directly retrieve the Brazil total for the exact age group “15 - 17”.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "brazil 100% (percent of the population)", "white 47.73% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)", "black 7.61% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)", "yellow 1.09% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)", "brown (multiracial) 43.13% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)", "indians 0.43% (percent in the race / percent in the age group)", "unspecified 0.0034%" FROM my_info_table WHERE "age group" = '15 - 17'
- Confirmation SQL (for the same age group):
  SELECT "age group", "brazil 100% (percent of the population)" FROM my_info_table WHERE "age group" = '15 - 17' LIMIT 1
- Result: For age group 15 - 17, "Brazil 100% (percent of the population)" = 10,357,874

Assessment
- The table contains an exact row for age group “15 - 17” with the Brazil total reported as 10,357,874.
- This directly matches the claim value 10357874 (without thousands separators).

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data returned from my_info_table.

Assumptions and notes
- The dataset does not specify a year; the verification assumes the row labeled “15 - 17” in my_info_table reflects the intended period for the claim.
- Although the column name includes the phrase “percent of the population,” the values for this age group appear as absolute counts; we rely on the stored figure as authoritative per the data grounding principles.
