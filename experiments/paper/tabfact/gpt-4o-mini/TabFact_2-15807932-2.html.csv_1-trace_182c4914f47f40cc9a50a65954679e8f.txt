What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a single competition dataset: the 1967 World Judo Championships (table: public.t_1967_world_judo_championships).
- Reviewed the table schema: nation-level medal counts with columns rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total.
- Queried the table to find South Korea’s medal breakdown.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate rows for Korea
- SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE nation ILIKE '%Korea%';
- Result:
  Nation: South Korea; Gold: 0; Silver: 1; Bronze: 2; Total: 3

Conclusion based on data
- In the 1967 World Judo Championships, South Korea won 0 gold medals (with 1 silver and 2 bronze). This supports the claim that South Korea earned no gold medal in the competition (as represented by the available dataset).

Assumptions
- “The competition” is interpreted as the only available competition dataset in the connected data environment: the 1967 World Judo Championships.
