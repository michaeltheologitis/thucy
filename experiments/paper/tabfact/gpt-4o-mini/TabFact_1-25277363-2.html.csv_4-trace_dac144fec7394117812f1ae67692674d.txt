Summary
- Claim interpreted: The episode number in series for the episode titled “the test” is before 148.0.
- Finding: The episode “the test” has no in series = 159, which is not before 148.0. The claim is false.

Data source and schema exploration
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with public schema containing table full_house_season_7 (via data source discovery tool).
- Table structure (via schema inspection tool):
  - Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text). No primary key.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any episode title containing ‘Test’ (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE title ILIKE '%Test%';
Result:
- no in series: 159; no in season: 15; title: the test

2) Verify the exact row and test the comparison against 148.0
SQL executed:
SELECT title, "no in series", "no in series" < 148.0 AS is_before_148 FROM public.full_house_season_7 WHERE title = 'the test';
Result:
- title: the test; no in series: 159; is_before_148: false

Conclusion
- The episode number in series for “the test” is 159, which is not before 148.0. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “episode number in the series” refers to the column "no in series".
- “the test” refers to the episode title exactly matching the value found in full_house_season_7.
- The verification is limited to the available dataset (Full House Season 7) identified in the connected data sources.
