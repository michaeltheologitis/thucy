Claim interpreted: The number of entries (on the grid) with 104 laps and a Time / Retired value of '+ 6.18' equals 1.

Data sources discovered:
- public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix (1964 Austrian Grand Prix results)

Schema and sample rows
- Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix LIMIT 5;
- Result (columns): constructor, driver, grid, laps, time / retired
- Sample rows observed include:
  - Ferrari | Lorenzo Bandini | Grid 7 | Laps 105 | Time / Retired 2:06:18.23
  - BRM | Richie Ginther | Grid 5 | Laps 105 | Time / Retired + 6.18
  - Brabham - Climax | Bob Anderson | Grid 14 | Laps 102 | Time / Retired + 3 laps

Verification steps and evidence
1) Does any row have laps = 104 AND time / retired = '+ 6.18'?
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE laps = 104 AND "time / retired" = '+ 6.18';
- Result: 0 rows

2) How many rows have time / retired = '+ 6.18' (regardless of laps)? Who is it and how many laps?
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE "time / retired" = '+ 6.18';
- Result: 1 row
- Executed SQL: SELECT driver, laps FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE "time / retired" = '+ 6.18';
- Result: Richie Ginther, 105 laps

3) Full details for the '+ 6.18' entry (to confirm grid position and laps)
- Executed SQL: SELECT constructor, driver, grid, laps, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE "time / retired" = '+ 6.18';
- Result: BRM | Richie Ginther | Grid 5 | Laps 105 | Time / Retired + 6.18

Findings
- There are zero entries with 104 laps and a Time / Retired value of '+ 6.18'.
- There is exactly one entry with '+ 6.18', but it has 105 laps (Richie Ginther, grid 5), not 104 laps.

Conclusion
The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the phrase “the no of grid have 104 lap and a time / retire of + 6.18 be 1” as a count of race result rows that simultaneously meet: laps = 104 and Time / Retired = '+ 6.18'.
- Verification is limited to the available dataset: 1964 Austrian Grand Prix results in public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix.
