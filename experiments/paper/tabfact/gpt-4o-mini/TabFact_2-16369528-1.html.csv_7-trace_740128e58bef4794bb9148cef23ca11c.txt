Claim to verify
“There be over 3 time when the reader's vote be not N/A and the lifetime achievement be also NA.” Interpreted as: count rows where the Reader's Vote field is not N/A and the Lifetime Achievement field is NA; check if this count > 3.

Data discovery and schema
- Data source discovered: public schema with table public.ned_kelly_awards.
- Columns (all text except year): year, "best teenage / young adult", "reader 's vote", "best non - fiction", "lifetime achievement".

How NA is encoded in the data
1) Reader's Vote – raw values and normalized forms
SQL:
SELECT "reader 's vote",
       LOWER(TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE("reader 's vote", '[^A-Za-z/]', '', 'g'))) AS normalized_vote,
       COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY "reader 's vote", normalized_vote
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result summary from the database:
- Raw "na" (normalized na): 14
- "bleeding hearts by lindy cameron" (normalized bleedingheartsbylindycameron): 1
- "apartment 255 by bunty avieson" (normalized apartmentbybuntyavieson): 1
Interpretation: NA for Reader's Vote is encoded as the string "na" (lowercase, no slash) in this dataset.

2) Lifetime Achievement – normalized values
SQL:
SELECT LOWER(TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE("lifetime achievement", '[^a-zA-Z/]', '', 'g'))) AS normalized,
       COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY normalized
ORDER BY count DESC;
Key result: normalized value "na" occurs 3 times among Lifetime Achievement entries (consistent with NA encoding as "na").

Direct test of the claim
A) Count rows where Reader's Vote is NOT NA and Lifetime Achievement IS NA (using consistent normalization)
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER("reader 's vote"), '[^a-z/]+', '', 'g') <> 'na'
  AND REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER("lifetime achievement"), '[^a-z/]+', '', 'g') = 'na';
Result: 0 rows

SQL (list any matches):
SELECT year, "reader 's vote", "lifetime achievement"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER("reader 's vote"), '[^a-z/]+', '', 'g') <> 'na'
  AND REGEXP_REPLACE(LOWER("lifetime achievement"), '[^a-z/]+', '', 'g') = 'na';
Result: no rows

B) Show all rows where Lifetime Achievement is NA to inspect Reader's Vote values
SQL:
SELECT year, "reader 's vote", "lifetime achievement"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(REGEXP_REPLACE("lifetime achievement", '[^a-zA-Z/]', '', 'g')) = 'na';
Result rows from the database:
- 1998: reader's vote = na; lifetime achievement = na
- 2000: reader's vote = na; lifetime achievement = na
- 2011: reader's vote = na; lifetime achievement = na
Interpretation: In every year where Lifetime Achievement is NA, Reader's Vote is also NA; therefore there are zero rows where Reader's Vote is not NA and Lifetime Achievement is NA.

Additional corroboration: total non-NA Reader's Vote rows
SQL (count non-NA in Reader's Vote):
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(REGEXP_REPLACE("reader 's vote", '[^a-zA-Z/]', '', 'g')) <> 'na';
Result: 2

SQL (list those rows):
SELECT year, "reader 's vote"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(REGEXP_REPLACE("reader 's vote", '[^a-zA-Z/]', '', 'g')) <> 'na';
Results from the database:
- 2001: bleeding hearts by lindy cameron
- 2002: apartment 255 by bunty avieson
Interpretation: Only two years have Reader's Vote not NA at all; thus it is impossible to have “over 3” rows simultaneously satisfying Reader's Vote not NA and Lifetime Achievement NA. The actual count is 0.

Conclusion
The data show 0 occurrences where Reader's Vote is not NA and Lifetime Achievement is NA. Therefore, the claim that there are over 3 such instances is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “not n / a” as a non-missing value, normalizing by removing punctuation/spaces and lowercasing so that variants like "N/A", "na", or "n a" all map to "na"; likewise for “also na” in Lifetime Achievement.
- Treated the public.ned_kelly_awards table as the authoritative dataset for this claim.
