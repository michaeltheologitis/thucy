Claim assessed: "there be currently 12 t - 260 eu aircraft in service"

Findings:
- The available data source contains a table (public.uruguayan_air_force) with aircraft inventory details, including a row for the Aermacchi SF260, version "T - 260 EU", and an "in service" value.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Query to locate entries referencing "260" in aircraft or versions
SQL:
SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%260%' OR versions ILIKE '%260%';
Result:
- aircraft: aermacchi sf260; versions: t - 260 eu; in service: 12

2) Query to confirm the specific row for the version "t - 260 eu"
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE LOWER(versions) = LOWER('t - 260 eu');
Result:
- Aircraft: Aermacchi SF260
- Origin: Italy
- Type: Trainer
- Versions: T - 260 EU
- In Service: 12

Conclusion:
- The data explicitly lists the Aermacchi SF260, version T - 260 EU, with 12 units in service. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- "Currently" refers to the state represented by the database snapshot; no timestamp is provided to indicate the data’s date.
- "t - 260 eu" corresponds to the Aermacchi SF260 EU variant shown in the table.
