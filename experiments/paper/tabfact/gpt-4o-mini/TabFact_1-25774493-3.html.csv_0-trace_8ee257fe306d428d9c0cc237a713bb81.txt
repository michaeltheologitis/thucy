Conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset for Dwight Howard’s career achievements, there is an entry within the 2007–08 season showing 23.8 points per game and 15.0 rebounds per game for the October/November 2007 period. This supports the claim that there was a period during a season with 23.8 PPG and 15.0 RPG.

Key Evidence
- Season: 2007 - 08 (1 / 2)
- Month: October / November 2007
- Team Record: 14-4
- Points Per Game: 23.8
- Rebounds Per Game: 15.0

Executed SQL Evidence
1) Enumerate schemas and tables
SQL:
SELECT n.nspname AS schema_name, c.relname AS table_name, c.reltuples AS row_count 
FROM pg_catalog.pg_class c 
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace 
WHERE c.relkind = 'r'  -- 'r' for ordinary tables 
ORDER BY n.nspname, c.relname;

2) Confirm base tables
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*), table_schema, table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE' 
GROUP BY table_schema, table_name 
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

3) Inspect table structure and sample rows
SQL (columns):
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard' ORDER BY ordinal_position;

SQL (sample rows):
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard LIMIT 5;

4) Verify 23.8 PPG and 15.0 RPG occurrence
SQL:
SELECT season, month, "team record", "points per game", "rebounds per game" 
FROM public.list_of_career_achievements_by_dwight_howard 
WHERE TRIM("points per game") = '23.8' AND TRIM("rebounds per game") = '15.0';

Returned Row:
- Season: 2007 - 08 (1 / 2); Month: October / November 2007; Team Record: 14-4; Points Per Game: 23.8; Rebounds Per Game: 15.0

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted as referring to a documented period within a season (as recorded in the achievements table), not necessarily a full-season average. The dataset reflects monthly/periodic performance within seasons for Dwight Howard.
