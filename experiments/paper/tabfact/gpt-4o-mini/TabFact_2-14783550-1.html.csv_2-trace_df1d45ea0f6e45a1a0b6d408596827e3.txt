Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games, which holds medal counts by nation for Wushu at the Asian Games.
- Schema (from inspection): columns = rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Key evidence queries and results:
1) Query: Retrieve nation, gold, silver, bronze, total for Singapore and Mongolia
SQL: SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games WHERE nation ILIKE '%Singapore%' OR nation ILIKE '%Mongolia%';
Result rows:
- singapore (sin) | gold: 0 | silver: 0 | bronze: 5 | total: 5
- mongolia (mgl)  | gold: 0 | silver: 0 | bronze: 3 | total: 3

2) Context query: Top nations by gold in Wushu at the Asian Games
SQL: SELECT nation, gold FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY gold DESC LIMIT 10;
Sample results (top entries):
- total | gold: 60
- china (chn) | gold: 43
- iran (iri) | gold: 4
- malaysia (mas) | gold: 3
- hong kong (hkg) | gold: 2
- thailand (tha) | gold: 2
- philippines (phi) | gold: 1
- chinese taipei (tpe) | gold: 1
- south korea (kor) | gold: 1
- macau (mac) | gold: 1

Conclusion:
- The database shows both Singapore and Mongolia have zero gold medals in Wushu at the Asian Games. Therefore, the claim that neither Singapore nor Mongolia has won a Wushu gold medal at the Asian Games is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Asian game” refers to the Asian Games multi-sport event, and the table aggregates Wushu medals across all relevant editions covered by the database. Country names in the dataset include the NOC code in parentheses (e.g., "singapore (sin)", "mongolia (mgl)").
