Claim to verify: "greg ostertag play the center position for the jazz from 1995 to 2004 and then from 2005 to 2006"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster, which appears to contain the Utah Jazz all-time roster with player details and years.

Schema confirmation
- Evidence (SQL):
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'utah_jazz_all_time_roster';
- Result summary:
  Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

Direct evidence for the claim
- Query to locate Greg Ostertag and retrieve his position and Jazz tenures:
  SQL executed:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Result:
  - Player: Greg Ostertag
  - Position: Center
  - Years for Jazz: 1995 - 2004, 2005 - 06

Assessment
- The data explicitly lists Greg Ostertag’s position as Center and his Utah Jazz years as 1995–2004 and 2005–06.
- This aligns with the claim wording “from 1995 to 2004 and then from 2005 to 2006.” The minor formatting difference (dash vs. “to” and “06” vs. “2006”) is consistent and acceptable.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the database evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “2005 to 2006” as the 2005–06 stint, which matches the roster entry’s formatting.
