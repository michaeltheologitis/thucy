Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: long_jump (columns: mark [text], wind [double precision], athlete [text], nationality [text], venue [text], date [text])

What I checked
1) Do all athletes share the same wind value except (Eric)k Walder and Bob Beamon?
2) What are the distinct wind values in the table and how many records have each?
3) What wind values do Walder and Beamon have specifically?

Evidence from the data
A) Athletes and their wind values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, wind, COUNT(*) as record_count
  FROM long_jump
  GROUP BY athlete, wind
  ORDER BY athlete, wind;
- Result excerpt (athlete → wind → count):
  • bob beamon → 2.0 → 1
  • carl lewis → 0.2 → 1
  • dwight phillips → 1.2 → 1
  • erick walder → 2.0 → 1
  • irving saladino → 1.2 → 1
  • iván pedroso → 1.9 → 1
  • larry myricks → 1.4 → 1
  • loúis tsátoumas → 1.6 → 1
  • mike powell → 0.3 → 1
  • robert emmiyan → 1.9 → 1
- Conclusion from A: Multiple athletes have different wind values; they are not all the same.

B) Distinct wind values and counts
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT wind, COUNT(*) AS athlete_count 
  FROM long_jump 
  GROUP BY wind 
  ORDER BY wind;
- Results:
  • 0.2 → 1
  • 0.3 → 1
  • 1.2 → 2
  • 1.4 → 1
  • 1.6 → 1
  • 1.9 → 2
  • 2.0 → 2
- Conclusion from B: There are multiple distinct wind values; no single wind value is shared by all athletes.

C) Specific check for Walder and Beamon
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, wind FROM long_jump WHERE athlete ILIKE '%walder%' OR athlete ILIKE '%beamon%';
- Results:
  • Bob Beamon → 2.0
  • Erick Walder → 2.0
- Conclusion from C: Walder and Beamon have the same wind value (2.0). They are not exceptions relative to one another, and many other athletes have different wind values.

Overall assessment
- The claim that “all athlete have the same wind except eric walder and bob beamon” is contradicted by the data. Many athletes have different wind values, and both Erick Walder and Bob Beamon share the same wind (2.0) rather than being unique exceptions.

Assumptions
- “eric walder” refers to “Erick Walder,” the spelling present in the data.
- The claim is evaluated against the TabFact.public.long_jump table as the relevant dataset for long jump performances and associated wind readings.
