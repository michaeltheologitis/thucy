Summary of the claim
- Interpreted claim: “All but one season either will have or has had the Army–Navy game in Baltimore, MD (M&T Bank Stadium).” This is a location-specific claim about the venue of the Army–Navy game across seasons.

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL (public schema).
- Available table: public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy.
- Purpose: Tracks Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy seasons, winners, and service academy head-to-head scores.

What the data can and cannot tell us
- The table provides: season, trophy winner, and game scores (including Army–Navy score).
- The table does not provide: game location, city, or stadium. Therefore, it cannot validate a claim about where the Army–Navy game was or will be played (e.g., Baltimore/M&T Bank Stadium).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Table structure (shows no location fields)
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'commander_in_chief_s_trophy';
Result:
- season (bigint)
- trophy winner (text)
- air force - navy score (text)
- air force - army score (text)
- army - navy score (text)

2) Seasons coverage in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS total_seasons FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy;
Result: 44 seasons
SQL:
SELECT MIN(season) AS first_season, MAX(season) AS last_season FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy;
Result: first_season = 1972, last_season = 2018

3) Sample Army–Navy score rows (illustrates absence of location info)
SQL:
SELECT season, "army - navy score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy ORDER BY season ASC LIMIT 10;
Result (examples):
- 1972 | 23 - 15
- 1973 | 51 - 0
- 1974 | 19 - 0
- 1975 | 30 - 6
- 1976 | 38 - 10
- 1977 | 17 - 14
- 1978 | 28 - 0
- 1979 | 31 - 7
- 1980 | 33 - 6
- 1981 | 3 - 3

Assessment
- The available, authoritative dataset does not include stadium or city fields. Consequently, it provides no evidence to support or refute the claim about the Army–Navy game being held in Baltimore/M&T Bank Stadium for all but one season. Given the requirement to ground conclusions strictly in available data, this claim is unsupported by the evidence accessible here.

Assumptions made
- The claim pertains to the location (city/stadium) of the Army–Navy game across seasons.
- The provided database is the only authoritative source available for this verification task.
- “Season” refers to college football seasons associated with the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy series among Army, Navy, and Air Force.
