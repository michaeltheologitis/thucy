Claim interpreted: “The fewest number of 2005 subscribers for Vodafone is 6125 in Morocco.” I verified this against the available mobile telephony dataset.

Data source discovery
- Source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa.

Schema overview (as discovered)
- Table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  - provider (text)
  - country (text)
  - subscribers (2005) (thousands) (numeric)
  - subscribers (2006) (thousands) (numeric)
  - growth % (numeric)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check which providers exist in the dataset
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT provider FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa;
- Result includes: vodafone (among others: airtel, vodacom, mtn, etc.)

2) Find the minimum 2005 subscribers for provider = 'vodafone'
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN("subscribers (2005) (thousands)") AS min_subscribers
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE provider = 'vodafone';
- Result: 6125

3) Identify the country (or countries) where Vodafone has this minimum value in 2005
- SQL:
  SELECT country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE provider = 'vodafone'
    AND "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" = (
      SELECT MIN("subscribers (2005) (thousands)")
      FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
      WHERE provider = 'vodafone'
    );
- Result: country = Egypt, subscribers (2005) (thousands) = 6125

4) List all Vodafone rows to confirm and to check if Morocco appears under Vodafone
- SQL:
  SELECT country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
  FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  WHERE provider = 'vodafone'
  ORDER BY "subscribers (2005) (thousands)" ASC;
- Result: single row — Egypt, 6125 (2005), 8704 (2006). No Morocco row for provider 'vodafone'.

Findings
- The minimum 2005 subscriber figure for Vodafone in this dataset is 6125 (thousands).
- That minimum belongs to Egypt, not Morocco.
- Morocco does not appear under the provider value 'vodafone' in the returned data.

Conclusion
- The numeric value (6125) for Vodafone’s fewest 2005 subscribers is supported by the data, but the country is Egypt, not Morocco. Therefore, the claim’s location detail is incorrect.

Assumptions made
- “Fewest number of 2005 subscriber for Vodafone” was interpreted as the minimum value in the column “subscribers (2005) (thousands)” among rows where provider = 'vodafone' in the table public.mobile_telephony_in_africa.
