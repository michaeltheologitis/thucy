Claim: “the nation of croatia win 3 medal all together, 2 of which be silver.”

Scope of verification: Based on the only available authoritative data source discovered (public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships), which contains medal totals by nation for the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Query to locate Croatia by name pattern
SQL: SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total 
FROM t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships 
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Croat%';
Result:
- Nation: Croatia
- Gold: 0
- Silver: 2
- Bronze: 1
- Total: 3

2) Direct match for Croatia
SQL: SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total 
FROM t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships 
WHERE nation ILIKE 'Croatia';
Result:
- Nation: Croatia
- Gold: 0
- Silver: 2
- Bronze: 1
- Total: 3

Assessment:
- Total medals for Croatia = 3
- Silver medals for Croatia = 2
Both statements in the claim are supported by the data for the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships.

Assumptions made:
- The claim’s event/context is unspecified. I interpreted it as referring to the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships because that is the only available dataset in the connected data sources.
