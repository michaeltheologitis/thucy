Claim to verify: “the record for the 400 m event before Sep 4, 2009 be over 48.83.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with a table memorial_van_damme.

Schema understanding
- memorial_van_damme columns: event (text), record (text), athlete (text), nationality (text), date (text).

Evidence collected
1) List all entries for the 400 m event
Executed SQL:
SELECT event, athlete, nationality, TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date, 
       (REPLACE(SUBSTRING(record FROM POSITION(':' IN record) + 1), ',', '.')::float) AS record_seconds 
FROM memorial_van_damme 
WHERE event = '400 m' 
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC;

Result (relevant fields):
- event: 400 m | athlete: Sanya Richards | parsed_date: 2009-09-04 | record_seconds: 48.83

Interpretation: The only 400 m record entry in this dataset is on 2009-09-04 with a time of 48.83.

2) Check for any 400 m records before 2009-09-04
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(  
               CASE   
                   WHEN POSITION(':' IN record) > 0 THEN  
                       REPLACE(SUBSTRING(record FROM POSITION(':' IN record) + 1), ',', '.')::float   
                   ELSE  
                       REPLACE(record, ',', '.')::float   
                   END) AS min_record_time,
               COUNT(*) AS qualifying_count  
           FROM memorial_van_damme  
           WHERE event = '400 m'  
           AND TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') < '2009-09-04';

Result: min_record_time = null; qualifying_count = 0.

Interpretation: There are no recorded 400 m entries dated before 2009-09-04 in this dataset. Therefore, the database provides no evidence of any earlier 400 m record time (whether over or under 48.83).

Conclusion
- The dataset shows a 400 m record of 48.83 on 2009-09-04 but contains no entries for the 400 m event before that date. Thus, the statement that “the record for the 400 m event before Sep 4, 2009 [was] over 48.83” is unsupported by the available data.

Verdict rationale
- Because there are no qualifying rows before 2009-09-04, the claim cannot be substantiated from this authoritative dataset. As such, it is unsupported by evidence.

Assumptions
- “Record” refers to the Memorial Van Damme meet record entries in the memorial_van_damme table.
- “400 m event” excludes hurdles (i.e., not “400 m hurdles”).
- “Over 48.83” is interpreted as a time greater than 48.83 seconds (slower than 48.83).
