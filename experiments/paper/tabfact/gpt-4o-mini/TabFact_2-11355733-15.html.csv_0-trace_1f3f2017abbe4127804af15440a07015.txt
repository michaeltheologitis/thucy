Summary
- Claim: “denis menchov on the rabobank team score 40 uci point.”
- Interpretation: Within the available dataset (2007 Volta a Catalunya table), verify whether Denis Menchov, riding for Rabobank, is credited with 40 UCI points.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya.
- Table schema (from the database):
  - cyclist (text)
  - country (text)
  - team (text)
  - time (text)
  - "uci points" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate Menchov’s record (case-insensitive search):
SQL:
SELECT cyclist, team, "uci points" FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE cyclist ILIKE '%Mench%';
Result:
- cyclist: denis menchov
- team: rabobank
- uci points: 40

2) Confirm both team and UCI points for Menchov:
SQL:
SELECT cyclist, team, "uci points" FROM t_2007_volta_a_catalunya WHERE cyclist ILIKE 'denis menchov' AND team ILIKE 'rabobank';
Result:
- cyclist: denis menchov
- team: rabobank
- uci points: 40

Assessment
- The database record explicitly shows “denis menchov” with team “rabobank” and “uci points” equal to 40 in the 2007 Volta a Catalunya table.
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the UCI points figure recorded in the 2007 Volta a Catalunya dataset available in the database.
- Minor differences in capitalization (e.g., “denis menchov” vs “Denis Menchov”, “rabobank” vs “Rabobank”) are considered non-substantive.
- “Score 40 uci point” is interpreted as “is credited with 40 UCI points” in this event’s context.
