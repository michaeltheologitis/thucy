Claim to verify: “gary and allison brook be the episode with the least amount of viewer.”

Interpretation: The claim asserts that an episode titled something like “Gary and Allison Brook(s)” is the least-watched episode of the show represented in the available dataset (the gary_unmarried table).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: gary_unmarried
- Table: gary_unmarried
  - Columns: episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the episode(s) with the lowest number of viewers and show the bottom 5 for context
- SQL (lowest only):
  SELECT episode, viewers
  FROM gary_unmarried
  ORDER BY viewers ASC
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: episode = "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal", viewers = 5.55 million

- SQL (bottom 5):
  SELECT episode, viewers
  FROM gary_unmarried
  ORDER BY viewers ASC
  LIMIT 5;
- Bottom 5 results:
  1. "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal" — 5.55 million
  2. "gary meets the gang" — 6.44 million
  3. "gary and his half brother" — 6.66 million
  4. "gary and allison 's restaurant" — 6.71 million
  5. "pilot" — 6.84 million

2) Confirm the minimum viewers value and list all episodes at that minimum
- SQL (min viewers):
  SELECT MIN(viewers) AS min_viewers FROM gary_unmarried;
- Result: min_viewers = 5.55

- SQL (episodes at min):
  SELECT episode FROM gary_unmarried WHERE viewers = (SELECT MIN(viewers) FROM gary_unmarried);
- Result: "gary fixes allison's garbage disposal"

3) Check for episodes that match the claimant’s phrasing ("gary and allison brook")
- SQL (search for episodes mentioning both gary and allison, and any with break/brook):
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM gary_unmarried WHERE episode ILIKE '%gary%' AND episode ILIKE '%allison%';
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM gary_unmarried WHERE episode ILIKE '%break%' OR episode ILIKE '%brook%';
- Relevant results include:
  - "gary and allison brooks" — 8.14 million
  - "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal" — 5.55 million
  - "gary and allison 's restaurant" — 6.71 million
  - "gary hooks up allison" — 7.57 million
  - "gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend" — 7.85 million

4) Directly confirm the viewership for the exact title “gary and allison brooks”
- SQL:
  SELECT episode, viewers FROM gary_unmarried WHERE episode = 'gary and allison brooks';
- Result: episode = "gary and allison brooks", viewers = 8.14 million

Conclusion:
- The least-watched episode in the dataset is "gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal" with 5.55 million viewers.
- The episode "gary and allison brooks" exists but has 8.14 million viewers, which is not the minimum.
- Therefore, the claim that “gary and allison brook(s)” is the episode with the least number of viewers is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “brook” refers to the episode titled “gary and allison brooks,” as this is the closest matching title in the dataset.
- “least amount of viewer” means the minimum viewers value in the gary_unmarried table.
- The gary_unmarried table contains the relevant episode viewership data for this verification.
