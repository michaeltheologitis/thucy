Summary
- Interpreted claim: In the available 1972 VFL season dataset, more than half of the away team scores (per match) exceed 10 total points.
- Result: 100% of matches in the dataset have away team total points > 10. Therefore, the claim holds under this interpretation.

Data Source Discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  - Columns (as provided by schema tooling): home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)
  - Score format example: G.B (TotalPoints), e.g., 9.11 (65). The number in parentheses is the total points.

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to verify score format
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Observation: Scores appear as G.B (P), e.g., away team score values like 9.11 (65), confirming the total points are inside parentheses.

2) Total number of matches in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Result: 6

3) Count matches where the away team total points > 10 and compute percentage
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS away_team_points_gt_10 FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(away_team_score FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) > 10;
Results: away_team_points_gt_10 = 6
Computation: 6/6 = 100%

Conclusion
- Since 100% of the away team scores exceed 10 total points in the available data, the statement “more than half of the away team have a score greater than 10” is satisfied under the interpretation that it refers to away team scores per match.

Assumptions
- The phrase “have a score” is interpreted at the team-match level (i.e., the away team’s total points in each match), not at the individual player level, because the dataset does not contain player-level scoring.
- “Score greater than 10” refers to the total points shown in parentheses in the score strings (G.B (TotalPoints)).
