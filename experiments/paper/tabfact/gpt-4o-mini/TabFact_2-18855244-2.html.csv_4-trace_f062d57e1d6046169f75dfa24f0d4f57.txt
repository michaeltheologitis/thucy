- Schema/table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (columns: medal count [bigint], date [text], athlete [text], nation [text], sport [text], record medal event [text])

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify sports entries containing “Gymnastics”
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT sport 
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists 
WHERE LOWER(sport) LIKE '%gymnastics%';
Result:
- gymnastics

2) Count distinct athletes in Gymnastics
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS unique_athletes_count 
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists 
WHERE LOWER(sport) LIKE '%gymnastics%';
Result:
- unique_athletes_count = 3

3) List the distinct athlete names in Gymnastics
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE LOWER(sport) LIKE '%gymnastics%';
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athlete_count FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE LOWER(sport) LIKE '%gymnastics%';
Results:
- Athletes: Carl Schuhmann; Hermann Weingärtner; Larisa Latynina
- distinct_athlete_count = 3

4) Sample rows for Gymnastics showing medal counts (to understand context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, "medal count" 
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists 
WHERE LOWER(sport) LIKE '%gymnastics%' 
ORDER BY "medal count" DESC, athlete ASC;
Result excerpt:
- larisa latynina: 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13
- hermann weingärtner: 6, 5, 4, 3
- carl schuhmann: 3

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly 3 distinct athletes associated with the sport labeled “gymnastics.” This supports the claim that “3 athlete receive medal in gymnastics,” when interpreted in the context of this dataset of multiple Olympic medalists.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim to refer to the number of unique athletes labeled with sport = “gymnastics” within the available dataset (which catalogs multiple Olympic medalists), not the total number of all gymnastics medalists historically.
- Text comparisons used case-insensitive matching on the sport field to capture any capitalization variants.
