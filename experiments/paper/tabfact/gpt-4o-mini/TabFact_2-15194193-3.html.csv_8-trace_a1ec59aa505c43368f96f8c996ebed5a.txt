Summary of the claim assessed:
- Interpreted claim: Alberto Pagani averaged 40 points in races he won in the 250cc class (or, more broadly, that he won in the 250cc class and averaged 40 points).

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: alberto_pagani(year bigint, class text, team text, points bigint, wins bigint)

Evidence from data
1) All 250cc seasons for Alberto Pagani
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, team, points, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc';
Result:
Year | Team      | Points | Wins
1960 | aermacchi | 2      | 0
1961 | aermacchi | 0      | 0
1962 | honda     | 8      | 0
1964 | paton     | 6      | 0
1965 | aermacchi | 1      | 0
1966 | aermacchi | 4      | 0
1967 | aermacchi | 0      | 0
1970 | aermacchi | 4      | 0
1971 | suzuki    | 0      | 0
Observation: He recorded zero wins in every 250cc season listed.

2) Total wins in 250cc
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc'
Result: total_wins = 0

3) Average points per season in 250cc
Executed SQL:
SELECT AVG(points) AS overall_average_points_per_season FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc';
Result: approximately 2.78 points per season

Assessment
- The data show Alberto Pagani had zero wins in the 250cc class. Therefore, any statement about his average points “in races he won” in 250cc is not applicable, and the premise that he “won in the 250cc class” is contradicted by the data.
- Additionally, his average points per season in 250cc (~2.78) is far from 40, further undermining a “40 points” average characterization in this class.

Conclusion
- The claim that Alberto Pagani averaged 40 points in races he won in the 250cc class (or that he won and averaged 40 points) is not supported; the data show zero wins and very low points totals in 250cc.

Assumptions made
- Due to the phrasing, I interpreted the claim as asserting that: (a) he had wins in the 250cc class, and (b) his average points related to those wins (or seasons) was 40. Verification was constrained to the available table, which lists season-level totals by class.
