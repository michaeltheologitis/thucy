Summary
- Claim to verify:
  1) When the engine is Ferrari V12s and the driver is Peter Whitehead, the tyre is P.
  2) When the engine is Ferrari V12s and the driver is Luigi Villoresi, the tyre is P.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: t_1950_swiss_grand_prix (1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset)
  - Columns: driver (text), entrant (text), constructor (text), chassis (text), engine (text), tyre (text)

Evidence
1) Identify Ferrari-powered entries and their tyres
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, engine, tyre FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE engine ILIKE 'Ferrari%';
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  1. Driver: Alberto Ascari, Engine: Ferrari V12s, Tyre: P
  2. Driver: Raymond Sommer, Engine: Ferrari V12s, Tyre: P
  3. Driver: Luigi Villoresi, Engine: Ferrari V12s, Tyre: P
  4. Driver: Peter Whitehead, Engine: Ferrari V12s, Tyre: P

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists both Peter Whitehead and Luigi Villoresi with engine = Ferrari V12s and tyre = P. This directly supports both parts of the claim.

Conclusion
- Both statements are supported by the retrieved data from the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix table.

Assumptions
- “tyre be p” is interpreted as the tyre code value recorded as 'P' in the dataset (commonly associated with Pirelli, though brand expansion was not required for verification).
- Verification is scoped to the available 1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset in the provided database.
