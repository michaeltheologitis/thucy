Claim to verify: "China have win 39 more gold medal than Iran for Wushu at the Asian Games."

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a table: wushu_at_the_asian_games.
- Table structure (public.wushu_at_the_asian_games): rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Evidence and results:
- Executed SQL:
  1) SELECT nation, gold FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games;

- Relevant result rows from this query:
  - China: gold = 43
  - Iran: gold = 4

Calculation:
- Difference (China gold − Iran gold) = 43 − 4 = 39

Conclusion:
- The data shows China has 43 Wushu gold medals and Iran has 4 at the Asian Games, a difference of 39—matching the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to cumulative Wushu medal totals across all editions of the Asian Games, which matches the aggregation present in the wushu_at_the_asian_games table.
