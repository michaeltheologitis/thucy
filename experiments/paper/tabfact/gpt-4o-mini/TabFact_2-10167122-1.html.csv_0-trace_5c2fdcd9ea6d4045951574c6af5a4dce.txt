Scope and data discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with one table, public.brian_watts, containing aggregated career stats by tournament for golfer Brian Watts.
- Table columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), top - 5 (bigint), top - 25 (bigint), events (bigint), cuts made (bigint).

Question interpreted
- Determine whether “the open championship” is the tournament with the highest number of events in the available dataset (excluding any non-tournament aggregate rows like “totals”).

Evidence
1) Identify the tournaments with the most events (raw order including any aggregate rows)
- Result (top rows by events):
  - totals: 17
  - the open championship: 7
  - pga championship: 6
  - masters tournament: 2
  - us open: 2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY events DESC LIMIT 10;

2) Count rows and list tournaments excluding aggregate/total rows, ordered by events
- Row count: 5
- Tournaments and events (excluding totals/aggregates):
  - The Open Championship: 7
  - PGA Championship: 6
  - US Open: 2
  - Masters Tournament: 2
- Executed SQL (row count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.brian_watts;
- Executed SQL (exclude totals/aggregates and order):
  SELECT DISTINCT tournament, events FROM public.brian_watts WHERE NOT (tournament ILIKE '%total%' OR tournament ILIKE '%aggregate%') ORDER BY events DESC;

Assessment
- The non-tournament aggregate row “totals” has the highest events (17) but is not a tournament.
- Among actual tournaments, The Open Championship has the highest number of events (7) in this dataset, ahead of the PGA Championship (6) and the US Open/Masters Tournament (2 each).

Conclusion
- Within the scope of the available data (Brian Watts’ tournament summaries) and excluding the aggregate “totals” row, The Open Championship is the tournament with the highest number of events.

Assumptions
- “Highest number of event” refers to the events counts in public.brian_watts.
- Aggregate rows like “totals” are excluded when interpreting “tournament.”
