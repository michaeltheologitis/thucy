Claim: Both W290AG and W282AE have ERP 27 W and Class D; one is licensed to Macon, Georgia and the other to Griffin, Georgia.

Findings from the data source (table: wyfk):
- For call sign w282ae
  - Result: ERP 27 W, Class D, City of License: Macon, Georgia
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class" FROM wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'w282ae';

- For call sign w290ag
  - Result: ERP 27 W, Class D, City of License: Griffin, Georgia
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class"
    FROM wyfk
    WHERE "call sign" = 'w290ag';

Conclusion: The data shows both stations have ERP 27 W and Class D. W282AE is licensed to Macon, Georgia, and W290AG is licensed to Griffin, Georgia. This matches the user's claim.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "erp w" and "class" as the corresponding columns in the wyfk table.
- Treated call signs case-insensitively; the database stores them in lowercase.
