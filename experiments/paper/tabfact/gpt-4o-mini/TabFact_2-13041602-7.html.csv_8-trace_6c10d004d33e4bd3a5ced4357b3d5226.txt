Claim interpreted: In the 2005 season, the Milwaukee Brewers played the New York Yankees only 2 times.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact Database
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
- Schema columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

What I checked and evidence:
1) Identify how opponents are named in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season ORDER BY opponent ASC;
- Result (distinct opponents): astros, cardinals, cubs, diamondbacks, padres, pirates, reds. Note: No listing for Yankees (or any AL opponent).

2) Directly check for any games vs “Yankees”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_vs_yankees FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yank%';
- Result: games_vs_yankees = 0

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yank%' ORDER BY date;
- Result: No records returned

3) Additional checks for alternate naming
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%new york%';
- Result: 0

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%nyy%';
- Result: 0

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%yankees%';
- Result: 0

Conclusion:
Based on the authoritative dataset available, the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers have 0 recorded games against the New York Yankees. Therefore, the claim that they played the Yankees “only 2 times” is not supported by the data and is contradicted by it.

Assumptions made:
- “play the yankee” refers to regular-season games against the New York Yankees in 2005.
- The provided table is the authoritative record for the Brewers’ 2005 game log in this environment.
