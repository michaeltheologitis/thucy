Claim to verify: “the wildcat play 4 game in september, 2 game in october, and 2 game in november.”

Data discovery:
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with one table related to the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

Schema inspection (relevant columns):
- game (bigint)
- date (text) — stores game dates (e.g., “sept 20”, “oct 4”, “nov 1”)
- opponent (text)
- result (text)
- wildcats points (bigint)
- opponents (bigint)
- record (text)

Evidence:
1) Full schedule (to inspect months)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team ORDER BY game;
- Key date values returned (month-day):
  sept 20, sept 27, oct 4, oct 11, oct 18, oct 25, nov 1, nov 8, nov 15, nov 22.
  Interpretation: 2 games in September, 4 games in October, 4 games in November.

2) Month-by-month counts
- September count
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'sept%';
  Result: 2
- October count
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'oct%';
  Result: 4
- November count
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'nov%';
  Result: 4

Assessment:
- Data shows 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November.
- The claim asserts 4 in September, 2 in October, and 2 in November.
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “the wildcat” is interpreted as the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team (the only available data source).
- Months refer to the in-season schedule months present in the dataset (September, October, November).
