Claim assessed: "justin leonard score less than 212 which put him tie for the 8th place"

Findings
- Placement: Supported. Justin Leonard is listed as tied for 8th place (T8) in the dataset.
- Score threshold: Not supported. His total shown in the dataset is exactly 212, not less than 212.

Evidence from the data
1) Identify Justin Leonard’s row
- Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Justin Leonard%';
- Result:
  - Place: t8
  - Player: Justin Leonard
  - Country: United States
  - Score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212
  - To Par: + 2

2) List all players tied for 8th to confirm placement and totals
- Executed SQL: SELECT player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(place) = 't8'
- Result:
  - Nick Faldo — Score: 70 + 76 + 66 = 212; To Par: +2
  - Justin Leonard — Score: 73 + 71 + 68 = 212; To Par: +2

Conclusion
- The data confirms Justin Leonard was tied for 8th place (T8) with a total of 212. The statement that he "score less than 212" is inaccurate; the correct figure is exactly 212.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the tournament captured in the available dataset (table: public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf), which appears to represent the 2002 U.S. Open standings for the rounds reflected by the scores shown (sum to 212).
