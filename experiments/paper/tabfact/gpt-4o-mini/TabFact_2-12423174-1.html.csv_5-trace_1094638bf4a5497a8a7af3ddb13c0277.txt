Claim to verify: "ASC Diaraf win against Stade Malien in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs."

Data sources explored
- Database: Postgres, Schema: public
- Relevant table: t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text), "agg" (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Query to find any fixture between ASC Diaraf and Stade Malien
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", agg 
FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
WHERE (lower("team 1") LIKE '%diaraf%' OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%diaraf%') 
AND (lower("team 1") LIKE '%stade malien%' OR lower("team 2") LIKE '%stade malien%') 
ORDER BY "team 1", "team 2";

Result:
- Team 1: asc diaraf
- Team 2: stade malien
- 1st Leg: 3 - 0
- 2nd Leg: 0 - 4
- Aggregate: 3 - 4

Interpretation
- ASC Diaraf beat Stade Malien 3-0 in the first leg, but lost the second leg 0-4.
- The aggregate score was 3-4, meaning Stade Malien won the tie and advanced. Thus, ASC Diaraf did not win the overall matchup, though they did win one leg.

Conclusion
- If the claim refers to winning the overall tie: the data contradicts it (ASC Diaraf lost on aggregate 3-4).
- If the claim refers to winning a match against Stade Malien within that tie: the data supports it (ASC Diaraf won the first leg 3-0).

Assumptions made
- Interpreted "win against" primarily as winning the two-legged tie (advancing), which is the common context in knockout competitions, while noting the per-leg result for completeness.
- The table t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs fully captures the 1971 tournament fixtures and outcomes for this pairing.
