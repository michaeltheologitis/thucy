Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the relevant schema to ground the verification in actual data.
- Queried the Primeira Liga 2010–2011 table for any record referencing Carlos Azenha, then retrieved the full row and performed an exact-match check on the claim’s fields.

Data source and schema inspected
- Database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Table: t_2010_11_primeira_liga
- Columns: team, outgoing head coach, manner of departure, date of vacancy, position in table, incoming head coach, date of appointment

Evidence collected
1) Search for records mentioning Azenha (case-insensitive)
- Result: Found Portimonense with incoming head coach Carlos Azenha; date of vacancy shown as 28 December 2011; date of appointment shown as 29 December 2010.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "incoming head coach", "date of vacancy", "date of appointment" 
FROM t_2010_11_primeira_liga 
WHERE LOWER("incoming head coach") LIKE '%azenha%';

2) Retrieve the full row for the Azenha record
- Result: 
  - Team: Portimonense
  - Outgoing Head Coach: Litos
  - Manner of Departure: Sacked
  - Date of Vacancy: 28 December 2011
  - Position in Table: 16th
  - Incoming Head Coach: Carlos Azenha
  - Date of Appointment: 29 December 2010
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_2010_11_primeira_liga WHERE "incoming head coach" ILIKE '%Azenha%';

3) Exact-match verification on the claim’s fields (robust to case/whitespace)
- Result: Returned the Portimonense row with date of vacancy = 28 december 2011 and incoming head coach = carlos azenha.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM t_2010_11_primeira_liga WHERE TRIM(LOWER("date of vacancy")) = '28 december 2011' AND TRIM(LOWER("incoming head coach")) = 'carlos azenha';

Conclusion
- The table contains a record where the date of vacancy is 28 December 2011 and the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha (team: Portimonense). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available Primeira Liga 2010–11 dataset and pertains to the Portimonense entry found in that dataset.
