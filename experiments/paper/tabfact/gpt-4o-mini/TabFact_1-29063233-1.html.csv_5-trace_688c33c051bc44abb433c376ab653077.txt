Claim: “the sweet dream episode happen earlier in the series than the witchfinder.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public, table merlin_series_2 (episodes of BBC Merlin Series 2)
- Table structure (key columns):
  - "no for series" (bigint): episode number within Series 2
  - title (text)
  - "original air date" (text)

Evidence:
1) List all episodes in order to locate the two titles and their episode numbers within the series.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "no for series", title FROM merlin_series_2 ORDER BY "no for series" ASC;
Result (excerpt):
- Episode 7: the witchfinder
- Episode 10: sweet dreams

2) Retrieve precise rows for the two episodes to confirm numbers and air dates.
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "no for series", "original air date" 
FROM merlin_series_2 
WHERE LOWER(title) IN ('the witchfinder', 'sweet dreams');
Results:
- the witchfinder | 7  | 7 November 2009
- sweet dreams    | 10 | 28 November 2009

Assessment:
- “the witchfinder” is Episode 7 of Series 2.
- “sweet dreams” is Episode 10 of Series 2.
- Therefore, Sweet Dreams occurs later in the series than The Witchfinder, not earlier.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “sweet dream” refers to the Merlin episode titled “sweet dreams”.
- “the witchfinder” refers to the Merlin episode titled “the witchfinder”.
- “earlier in the series” refers to ordering within BBC Merlin Series 2, which contains both episodes.
