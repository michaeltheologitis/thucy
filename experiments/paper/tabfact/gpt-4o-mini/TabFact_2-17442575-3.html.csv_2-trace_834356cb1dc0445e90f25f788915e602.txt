Claim to verify: “the chicago black hawk be the visitor team when the record be 2 - 3 on april 17.”

Scope and data sources
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with a single table for the Chicago Black Hawks’ 1965–66 season: public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season.
- Relevant schema (from data source):
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Evidence from data
1) Identify the game on April 17 and its details
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, home, score, visitor, record FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE date = 'april 17';
- Result (as returned by the tool): On April 17, the Chicago Black Hawks were the home team vs. the Detroit Red Wings; score 5-3; record shown as 2 - 3.

2) Check if any April 17 game has Chicago Black Hawks as the visitor
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, home, score, visitor, record FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE date = 'april 17' AND LOWER(visitor) = 'chicago black hawks';
- Result: No rows returned (i.e., no April 17 entry where Chicago Black Hawks are the visitor).

3) Context (sample rows confirm formatting and the April 17 entry)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season LIMIT 10;
- Sample includes:
  - april 17 | chicago black hawks (home) | 5 - 3 | detroit red wings (visitor) | 2 - 3

Assessment of the claim
- Part true: On April 17, the record was 2 - 3.
- False: The Chicago Black Hawks were not the visitor team that day; they were the home team.

Conclusion: The core assertion (“be the visitor team”) is contradicted by the data, though the record detail (2 - 3) is correct.

Assumptions
- “april 17” is interpreted as the April 17 found within the available 1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks season dataset.
- “chicago black hawk” refers to the Chicago Black Hawks (historical team name spelling used in the dataset).
