- SQL Query Used:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE skip ILIKE '%Jean-Michel%' OR skip ILIKE '%Jean Michel%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean - michel%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean michel%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean-michel%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean - michel mãnard%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean michel mãnard%' OR skip ILIKE '%jean-michel mãnard%';

Assessment
- The claim "skip jean - michel ménard have a shot pct of 80% and 8 blank end" is fully supported by the data in the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table: shot pct = 80% and blank ends = 8 for the row corresponding to Jean-Michel Ménard (noting a minor accent variation in the stored name).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset for the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier. If a different event/year was intended, figures could differ.
- Minor spelling/accent differences (Ménard vs. Mãnard) are treated as the same individual.
