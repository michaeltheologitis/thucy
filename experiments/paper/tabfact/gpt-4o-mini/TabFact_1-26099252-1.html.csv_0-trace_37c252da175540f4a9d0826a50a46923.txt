Claim to verify: “4.2.1 Jelly Bean, released November 27, 2012, is the stable version of the software.”

Data source discovery
- Available PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: html5_video (reliable and authoritative within scope).

Schema overview (from the database)
- Table: public.html5_video
  - Columns: browser (text), operating system (text), latest stable release (text), theora (text), h264 (text), vp8 ( webm ) (text), vp9 ( webm ) (text)

Evidence gathered from the data
1) Explore sample rows and OS values
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video LIMIT 20;
Result (excerpt):
- Row includes: browser = android browser; operating system = android; latest stable release = 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012)

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "operating system" FROM public.html5_video;
Result (relevant values): android, ios, windows, macos x, windows phone, windows rt, all supported, and one version-like string (for a browser row)

2) Direct lookup for Android Browser
SQL:
SELECT "latest stable release", "operating system" FROM public.html5_video WHERE "browser" ILIKE 'Android Browser';
Result: latest stable release = 4.2.1 Jelly Bean (November 27, 2012); operating system = Android

3) Full row retrieval for Android context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE "operating system" = 'android' OR "browser" ILIKE 'android%';
Result: browser = android browser; operating system = android; latest stable release = 4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27 , 2012); h264 = 3.0; theora = 2.3; vp8 ( webm ) = 2.3; vp9 ( webm ) = no

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists the “latest stable release” for the Android Browser as “4.2.1 jelly bean (november 27, 2012).” This directly supports the claim that 4.2.1 Jelly Bean, released on November 27, 2012, is the stable version (within the scope of this dataset’s terminology and context).

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “The software” is interpreted in the context of this dataset as the Android platform entry corresponding to the Android Browser row, whose “latest stable release” field denotes the stable OS version and release date referenced.
