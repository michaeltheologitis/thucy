Claim interpreted: “Linfield be the opponent in venue a.” Interpreted as: within the available dataset (Rangers F.C. 2003–04 season), there exists a match where the opponent is Linfield and the venue code is ‘a’ (away).

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_2003_04_rangers_f_c_season
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence 1: Check for any match with opponent name containing ‘linfield’ (case-insensitive)
- Result returned:
  - Date: 30 July 2003
  - Opponent: linfield
  - Venue: a
  - Result: 3 - 0
  - Attendance: 13284
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM public.t_2003_04_rangers_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%linfield%';

(Additional context) Evidence 2: Distinct venue codes present (to confirm ‘a’ is among valid venue values)
- Result summary: venue 'n': 1, venue 'a': 4, venue 'h': 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.t_2003_04_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY venue;

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains a match where the opponent is Linfield and the venue is ‘a’ (away). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “venue a” is interpreted as venue code 'a' used in the table to denote an away match.
- The claim refers to the available Rangers F.C. 2003–04 season dataset in the connected source.
