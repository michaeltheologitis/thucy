Summary
- Interpreted claim: “8 of the viral diseases possess an envelope.”
- Finding: The database shows 15 enveloped and 8 non-enveloped entries. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.viral_disease.
- Schema (relevant fields): envelopment (text) indicates whether the virus is enveloped.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct envelopment values and counts
- Result: 
  • Enveloped: 15 rows
  • Non - Enveloped: 8 rows
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT envelopment, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY envelopment;

2) Total count of enveloped rows
- Result: 15
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.viral_disease WHERE envelopment = 'enveloped';

Conclusion
- The claim that 8 viral diseases are enveloped is contradicted by the data. The data indicate 15 enveloped entries and 8 non-enveloped entries.

Assumptions
- I interpreted “8 of the viral disease possess an enveloped” to mean “8 entries in public.viral_disease are enveloped.” If the intention was instead to state that 8 are non-enveloped, that would match the data, but it contradicts the phrasing about possessing an envelope.
