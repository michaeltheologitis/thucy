Claim to verify: "the prince park venue have just as much crowd as the junction oval [venue]"

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1975_vfl_season (columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date)

Step 1 — Identify venues and match counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue
ORDER BY match_count DESC;

Result excerpt (relevant venues):
- Princes Park: 1 match
- Junction Oval: 1 match
(Other venues also have 1 match each in this dataset.)

Step 2 — Compare attendance (“crowd”) at the two venues
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS number_of_matches, SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS average_crowd
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue;

Result excerpt (relevant venues):
- Princes Park: number_of_matches = 1, total_crowd = 23830, average_crowd = 23830
- Junction Oval: number_of_matches = 1, total_crowd = 16249, average_crowd = 16249

Analysis
- In the available 1975 VFL season data, both venues hosted one match each.
- The recorded crowd at Princes Park (23,830) is significantly higher than at Junction Oval (16,249). This is not “just as much”; it is about 7,581 more attendees (~47% higher) at Princes Park.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the accessible dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “prince park” as “Princes Park,” the standard venue name in VFL records.
- Interpreted “just as much crowd” to mean comparable/equal attendance. Comparison is based on the available season data (1975) in this database; crowd refers to the recorded attendance (“crowd” column).
