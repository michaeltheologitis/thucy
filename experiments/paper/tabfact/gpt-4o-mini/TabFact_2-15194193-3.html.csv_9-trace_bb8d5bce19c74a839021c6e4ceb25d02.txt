Claim to verify: "alberto pagani have race for aermacchi 10 time, more than any other team, win all of them"

Findings
- Raced for Aermacchi 10 times: Supported by the data (10 entries with team = 'aermacchi').
- More than any other team: Supported. Aermacchi has the highest number of entries (10); the next highest teams have 4 entries each.
- Won all of them: Contradicted. Total wins with Aermacchi = 0 across those entries.

Evidence from the database
1) Show all rows (context of available teams/years/wins)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM alberto_pagani;
Key rows relevant to Aermacchi and wins include multiple years with Aermacchi, each showing wins = 0. The full output (as retrieved) includes, for example: 1960 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1961 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1965 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1965 350cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1966 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1966 350cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1967 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1967 350cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1969 350cc Aermacchi (wins 0), 1970 250cc Aermacchi (wins 0).

2) Count entries and wins per team (to compare Aermacchi vs others)
SQL executed:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS entry_count, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE class IS NOT NULL AND year IS NOT NULL GROUP BY team ORDER BY entry_count DESC;
Result highlights:
- Aermacchi — Entries: 10, Total Wins: 0
- Norton — Entries: 4, Total Wins: 0
- MV Agusta — Entries: 4, Total Wins: 2
- Linto — Entries: 4, Total Wins: 2
- Others (Honda, Derbi, Paton, Suzuki, Ducati, Kreidler) — 1–2 entries each, 0 wins.
This shows Aermacchi has more entries than any other team, but 0 total wins.

3) Exact count of Aermacchi entries
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS entry_count FROM alberto_pagani WHERE team = 'aermacchi';
Result: 10

4) Total wins with Aermacchi
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE team = 'aermacchi';
Result: 0

5) All Aermacchi rows (to confirm wins per entry)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, class, points, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE team = 'aermacchi' ORDER BY year, class;
Result (year, class, points, wins):
- 1960 250cc: 2, 0
- 1961 250cc: 0, 0
- 1965 250cc: 1, 0
- 1965 350cc: 0, 0
- 1966 250cc: 4, 0
- 1966 350cc: 11, 0
- 1967 250cc: 0, 0
- 1967 350cc: 11, 0
- 1969 350cc: 0, 0
- 1970 250cc: 4, 0
All show wins = 0.

Conclusion
- The statements that he raced for Aermacchi 10 times and that this is more than any other team are supported by the data.
- The statement that he "won all of them" is contradicted by the data, which shows zero wins with Aermacchi.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "race for ... 10 time" as number of season-class entries recorded in the table for team = 'aermacchi', since the available data is aggregated by year and class, not per individual race start.
- Treated the "team" field as the relevant entity for the claim (it appears to represent the team/manufacturer he rode for in that year/class).
- Interpreted "win all of them" as having wins in those entries for Aermacchi; the wins column reflects Grand Prix wins for that year/class entry.
