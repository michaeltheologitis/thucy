Conclusion: The claim that Lukáš Melich competed in the Olympic Games two times is supported by the data.

Evidence from the data source (public.luk_melich):
- Query executed:
  SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes FROM luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%Olympic%';
  Result rows:
  • 2008 | Olympic Games | Beijing, PR China | 29th | 70.56 m
  • 2012 | Olympic Games | London, Great Britain | 6th | 77.17 m

- Query executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS participation_count FROM luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%Olympic%';
  Result: participation_count = 2

- Query executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%Olympic%';
  Result: 2008, 2012

Assessment:
- The table records two Olympic Games participations for Lukáš Melich (2008 and 2012). This matches the claim of “2 times.”

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “complete in the olympic game 2 time” as “competed in the Olympic Games two times.”
- Interpreted “Olympic Games” as Summer Olympic Games, consistent with athletics (hammer throw).
