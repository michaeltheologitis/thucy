Interpretation of the request:
- I interpret your question as: “Identify the event(s) where the driver is Raymond Sommer and the engine is Ferrari V12s; when did this occur?”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact (Table-based Fact Verification)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
  - Columns: driver (text), entrant (text), constructor (text), chassis (text), engine (text), tyre (text)

Findings:
- The only available dataset pertains to the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix. Within this table, there is an entry where the driver is Raymond Sommer and the engine is Ferrari V12s. Therefore, the “when” in the context of the available data is the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Query to directly match the driver and engine (case-insensitive):
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE driver ILIKE 'Raymond Sommer' AND engine ILIKE 'Ferrari V12s';
Result:
- driver: Raymond Sommer
- entrant: Scuderia Ferrari
- constructor: Ferrari
- chassis: Ferrari 125
- engine: Ferrari V12s
- tyre: P

2) Cross-check listing entries for Raymond Sommer:
SQL: SELECT driver, engine FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE driver ILIKE 'Raymond Sommer';
Result:
- driver: Raymond Sommer, engine: Ferrari V12s

Conclusion:
- Based on the available data, Raymond Sommer driving a car with a Ferrari V12s engine is recorded at the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.

Assumptions:
- “When” refers to the event represented by the only available table (the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix), since the dataset does not include broader season/date information beyond this event.
