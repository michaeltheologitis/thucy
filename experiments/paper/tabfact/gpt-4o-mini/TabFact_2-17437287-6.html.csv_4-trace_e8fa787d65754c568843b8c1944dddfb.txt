Claim to verify: “the score for the game where Birmingham City be the away team on 10 March 1984 be 1 - 3.”

Summary conclusion: On 10 March 1984 (FA Cup 1983–84), Birmingham City played at home against Watford, and the score was 1–3. There is no record of Birmingham City being the away team on that date in the available data. Therefore, the score 1–3 is correct for that date, but Birmingham City were the home team, not the away team.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) List all matches on 10 March 1984
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public."t_1983_84_fa_cup" WHERE lower("date") = '10 march 1984';
Results:
- Tie No: 1 | Home Team: Notts County | Score: 1 - 2 | Away Team: Everton | Date: 10 March 1984
- Tie No: 3 | Home Team: Plymouth Argyle | Score: 0 - 0 | Away Team: Derby County | Date: 10 March 1984
- Tie No: 4 | Home Team: Birmingham City | Score: 1 - 3 | Away Team: Watford | Date: 10 March 1984

2) Check for Birmingham City as the away team on 10 March 1984
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public."t_1983_84_fa_cup" WHERE lower("away team") = 'birmingham city' AND lower("date") = '10 march 1984';
Results: No rows returned.

3) Confirm Birmingham City as the home team on 10 March 1984
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public."t_1983_84_fa_cup" WHERE lower("home team") = 'birmingham city' AND lower("date") = '10 march 1984';
Results:
- Home Team: Birmingham City | Score: 1 - 3 | Away Team: Watford | Date: 10 March 1984

Assessment:
- The data show that Birmingham City played on 10 March 1984 in the FA Cup, but they were the home team, not the away team. The stated score (1–3) is correct for that match, but the home/away designation in the claim is wrong.

Assumptions:
- Verification is performed against the available authoritative dataset: public.t_1983_84_fa_cup (FA Cup 1983–84). No other competitions are present in the accessible data.
- Dates are matched exactly as stored (text) in the dataset.
