Scope and data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1972_vfl_season, which contains match data (home team, away team, scores, venue, crowd, date). The data covers one match day in 1972 (15 July 1972) comprising 6 matches.

Schema (from data source)
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

Evidence 1: Dataset scope and coverage
- Result: 6 total matches; 1 distinct date (15 July 1972); min crowd 7,007; max crowd 30,883.
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
  - SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_dates_count FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
  - SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
  - SELECT MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;

Evidence 2: Top crowds in the available data
- Result (ordered by crowd desc):
  1) Collingwood vs Melbourne — VFL Park — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 30,883
  2) Essendon vs Richmond — Windy Hill — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 22,251
  3) Footscray vs St Kilda — Western Oval — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 18,655
  4) Carlton vs South Melbourne — Princes Park — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 14,465
  5) Hawthorn vs Geelong — Glenferrie Oval — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 12,425
  6) Fitzroy vs North Melbourne — Junction Oval — 15 July 1972 — Crowd: 7,007
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT "home team", "away team", date, venue, crowd FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season ORDER BY crowd DESC LIMIT 10;

Evidence 3: Rank of the Collingwood vs Melbourne match by attendance
- Result: Collingwood vs Melbourne — 15 July 1972 — VFL Park — Crowd: 30,883 — Crowd Rank: 1 (highest in the dataset)
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT "home team", "away team", date, venue, crowd, DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY crowd DESC) AS crowd_rank FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season WHERE ("home team" ILIKE 'Collingwood' AND "away team" ILIKE 'Melbourne') OR ("home team" ILIKE 'Melbourne' AND "away team" ILIKE 'Collingwood') ORDER BY crowd DESC;

Conclusion
- Based on the available (authoritative within scope) dataset for 15 July 1972, the Collingwood vs Melbourne match had the largest crowd, not the third largest. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted within the scope of the accessible dataset (public.t_1972_vfl_season), which contains one round of matches on 15 July 1972. If the claim referred to a different season, competition, or broader historical context, that is outside the available data here.
