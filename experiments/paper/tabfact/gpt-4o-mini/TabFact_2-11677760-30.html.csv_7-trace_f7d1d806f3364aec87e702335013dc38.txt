Summary:
I interpreted your question as asking whether (or if there is evidence that) Kansas (University of Kansas) has gotten a player who attended St. Anthony High School. I explored the available data source containing USA Today All-USA High School Basketball Team selections, which includes players’ high schools and listed colleges. Within this dataset, I found no instance of a St. Anthony High School player whose listed college is Kansas.

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team (columns: player, height, school, hometown, college)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Direct check for St. Anthony + Kansas
SQL:
SELECT player, school, college FROM usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE school ILIKE '%St. Anthony%' AND college ILIKE '%Kansas%';
Result: 0 rows (no matches).

2) Broader check for any school containing 'Anthony' to inspect possible naming variations and see listed colleges
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT school, player, college 
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team 
WHERE school ILIKE '%Anthony%';
Result excerpt:
- School: St Anthony High School | Player: Myles Mack | College: Rutgers
No entries showed Kansas as the listed college for any St. Anthony High School player in this dataset.

Conclusion:
Based on the available authoritative dataset (USA Today All-USA HS Basketball Team selections), there is no record of a player from St. Anthony High School whose listed college is Kansas.

Assumptions made:
- "kansa college" was interpreted as the University of Kansas. 
- "St Anthony High School" includes any high school named St. Anthony (e.g., the well-known St. Anthony HS in Jersey City, NJ). 
- The verification is limited to players included in the USA Today All-USA High School Basketball Team dataset; it may not cover every St. Anthony alumnus historically, only those recognized in this dataset.
