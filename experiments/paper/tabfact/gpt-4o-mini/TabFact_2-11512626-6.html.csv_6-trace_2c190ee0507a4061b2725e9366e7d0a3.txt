Claim interpreted: “Attendance was less than 20,000 five times between August 4 and August 6.” Scope limited to the available dataset: 1997 Colorado Rockies season game log.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (1997 Colorado Rockies games)

Table structure (from schema inspection):
- date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence 1: Sample inspection to confirm date format and August entries
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season LIMIT 20;
Observation: Dates are stored as lowercase text like "august 4" (no year).

Evidence 2: Count games with attendance < 20000 on August 4–6
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as game_count FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE attendance < 20000 AND date IN ('august 4', 'august 5', 'august 6');
Result: 2

Evidence 3: List all games on August 4–6 (to verify counts and values)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date IN ('august 4','august 5','august 6');
Results:
- august 4 | phillies | 15230 | 7 - 3 | castillo (8 - 10) | 52 - 61
- august 5 | phillies | 16428 | 4 - 2 | bottalico (2 - 4) | 53 - 61
- august 6 | mets     | 26633 | 4 - 0 | mlicki (5 - 8)    | 54 - 61

Finding:
- Only 2 games (Aug 4 and Aug 5) had attendance < 20,000 in that date range. There are not five such occurrences between August 4 and August 6 in the 1997 Rockies data.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- “Between august 4 and 6th” interpreted as inclusive of Aug 4, Aug 5, Aug 6, within the 1997 season (the only available dataset).
- “over 5 time” interpreted as “five occurrences.”
