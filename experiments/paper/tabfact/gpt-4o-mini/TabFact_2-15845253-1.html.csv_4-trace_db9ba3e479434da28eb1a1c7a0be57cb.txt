Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and relevant schema.
- Queried the viral_disease table to count and list viral families whose virion shape is helical, first using exact matches, then using a case-insensitive contains search to capture composite labels (e.g., “bullet-shaped helical”).

Data source discovery
- Available schema: public
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Exact match on virion shape = 'helical'
- Result: 6 distinct families
- Families: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
  FROM viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'helical';

  SELECT DISTINCT family
  FROM viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" = 'helical';

2) Case-insensitive contains match for 'helical' in virion shape
- Result: 7 distinct families
- Families: Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Coronaviridae, Filoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, Rhabdoviridae
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT family FROM public.viral_disease WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';

3) Count of distinct families for the contains match
- Result: 7
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE LOWER("virion shape") LIKE '%helical%';

Conclusion
- The dataset shows 7 distinct viral families with a virion shape that contains the descriptor “helical.” Therefore, the claim is supported by the data when interpreting “have a helical virion shape” to include composite descriptors that contain “helical.”

Assumptions
- “Have a helical virion shape” is interpreted to include any virion shape description containing the word “helical” (case-insensitive), not only those equal to exactly “helical.”
- Distinctness is evaluated at the family level using COUNT(DISTINCT family) within the viral_disease table.
