Claim interpreted: “Natalia Strelkova did not lose the women’s skating championship.” I interpret this as asserting that Natalia Strelkova was not a non-winner (i.e., she did not lose) of the relevant women’s skating championship.

Data sources explored
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships, containing competitors and placements (rank, name, nation, SP+FS, points, places) for the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships (women’s event).

Key evidence from the data
1) Locate Natalia Strelkova in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships table
- SQL:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Strelk%';
- Result (relevant row):
  Name: Natalia Strelkova; Nation: Soviet Union; Rank: 13; SP + FS: 16; Points: 164.94; Places: 134

2) Identify the champion (rank = 1)
- SQL:
  SELECT name, nation, points
  FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships
  WHERE rank = 1;
- Result: Linda Fratianne (United States), 186.92 points

3) Full table retrieval (for context)
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
- Result excerpt: Rank 1 Linda Fratianne; Rank 2 Anett Pötzsch; Rank 3 Emi Watanabe; … Rank 13 Natalia Strelkova; etc.

Assessment
- In the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships (women’s event), the champion was Linda Fratianne. Natalia Strelkova finished 13th. Therefore, she did not win the championship—in everyday terms, she “lost” (i.e., was not the champion). The claim that she “did not lose the skating championship” is contradicted by the data for this championship.

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset (1979 Worlds), the claim is inaccurate: Natalia Strelkova did not win and thus did “lose” that championship.

Assumptions
- “Skating championship” is interpreted as the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships (women’s singles), which is the sole relevant dataset available.
- “Lose” is interpreted as “not win the championship.”
