Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the relevant schema.
- Retrieved Lukáš Melich’s competition results from the available table.
- Identified the last two competitions by most recent year and extracted their distances.
- Computed the average of those two distances and compared it to the claimed 78.27 m.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: luk_melich (columns: year, competition, venue, position, notes)

Step 1: Inspect all available records
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM luk_melich;

Result snapshot (key fields):
- 2013 | world championships | 79.36 m
- 2012 | olympic games | 77.17 m
- 2009 | world championships | 74.47 m
- 2008 | olympic games | 70.56 m
- … (earlier years)

Step 2: Identify the last two competitions and parse distances
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, competition, SUBSTRING(notes FROM '([0-9.]+) m')::numeric AS distance_m
FROM luk_melich
WHERE notes LIKE '% m'
ORDER BY year DESC
LIMIT 2;

Returned rows:
- 2013 | World Championships | 79.36
- 2012 | Olympic Games | 77.17

Step 3: Compute the average distance of the last two competitions
Executed SQL (queries returned by the tool):
1) Retrieve last two competitions
SELECT year, competition, notes FROM luk_melich WHERE notes IS NOT NULL ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 2;
2) Compute the average
SELECT AVG(CAST(REPLACE(notes, ' m', '') AS DECIMAL)) AS average_distance FROM (SELECT notes FROM luk_melich WHERE notes IS NOT NULL ORDER BY year DESC LIMIT 2) AS distances;

Computation details:
- Distances: 79.36 m and 77.17 m
- Average: (79.36 + 77.17) / 2 = 78.265 m
- Rounded to two decimals: 78.27 m

Conclusion
- The data shows that in Lukáš Melich’s last two competitions (2013 World Championships and 2012 Olympic Games), his average throw distance is 78.27 m when rounded to two decimal places. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- “Last 2 competition” is interpreted as the two most recent competitions by year in the provided dataset (2013 and 2012).
- The “notes” field contains the primary performance distance for each competition and is used for the average computation.
- “Throw” refers to the competition performance distance (hammer throw), consistent with the athlete’s event.
