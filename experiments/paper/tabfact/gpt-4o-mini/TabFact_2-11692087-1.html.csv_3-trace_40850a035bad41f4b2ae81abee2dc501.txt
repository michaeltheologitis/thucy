Claim to verify: “1977 / 1978 / 1989 season have more than 26 point, less than 18 game, and exactly 13 loss.”

Data source explored
- Available database: public schema with table public.coquitlam_adanacs (season text, team name text, games bigint, losses bigint, points bigint).

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve stats for the specified seasons
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, games, losses, points
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989');

Result:
- 1977: games = 24, losses = 13, points = 22
- 1978: games = 24, losses = 13, points = 21
- 1989: games = 24, losses = 13, points = 22

2) Check each condition per season
Executed SQL:
SELECT season,
       CASE WHEN points > 26 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS points_gt_26,
       CASE WHEN games < 18 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS games_lt_18,
       CASE WHEN losses = 13 THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS losses_eq_13
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989');

Result (by season):
- 1977: points_gt_26 = FALSE, games_lt_18 = FALSE, losses_eq_13 = TRUE
- 1978: points_gt_26 = FALSE, games_lt_18 = FALSE, losses_eq_13 = TRUE
- 1989: points_gt_26 = FALSE, games_lt_18 = FALSE, losses_eq_13 = TRUE

3) Verify if any season meets all three conditions simultaneously
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989')
  AND points > 26 AND games < 18 AND losses = 13;

Result:
- count = 0

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “More than 26 points”: Not supported for 1977 (22), 1978 (21), or 1989 (22).
- “Less than 18 games”: Not supported; each season lists 24 games.
- “Exactly 13 losses”: Supported; each season has 13 losses.

Conclusion
- The overall claim that each of the 1977, 1978, and 1989 seasons simultaneously meets all three conditions is contradicted by the data. Only the “exactly 13 loss” part is true; the other two conditions are false for all three seasons.

Assumptions
- “Season” refers to the season field in public.coquitlam_adanacs and identifies years 1977, 1978, and 1989 for the Coquitlam Adanacs.
- “Points,” “games,” and “losses” correspond directly to the points, games, and losses columns in the table.
