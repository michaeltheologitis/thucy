Summary
- Interpreted claim: "2 home teams have the same score as the away team they played" as asserting there were exactly two drawn matches (home total points = away total points) in the available dataset.
- Data examined: A single PostgreSQL table public.t_1938_vfl_season containing 6 matches (appearing to be one round dated 18 June 1938).
- Finding: 0 matches ended with equal total points. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Data source discovery
- Available database: Main PostgreSQL database
- Table: public.t_1938_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), crowd (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows (to confirm score format)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, "date"
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
LIMIT 10;
Result (abridged): scores are of the form G.B (Pts), e.g., 11.23 (89)

2) Row count and score parsing quality checks
- Total rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Result: 6

- Home-team score parsing errors (expect format like 11.23 (89))
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS parse_error_home FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season WHERE "home team score" !~ '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ \(([0-9]+)\)$';
Result: 0

- Away-team score parsing errors
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS parse_error_away FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season WHERE "away team score" !~ '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+ \(([0-9]+)\)$';
Result: 0

3) Extract total points and compare for equality (per match)
SQL:
SELECT 
    "home team", 
    regexp_replace("home team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\\1')::int AS extracted_home_points, 
    "away team", 
    regexp_replace("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\\1')::int AS extracted_away_points, 
    (regexp_replace("home team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\\1')::int = regexp_replace("away team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\\1')::int) AS is_equal 
FROM 
    public.t_1938_vfl_season;
Results (per row): is_equal = false for all 6 matches. Example rows:
- Geelong 89 vs Hawthorn 49 -> false
- Fitzroy 108 vs South Melbourne 56 -> false
- St Kilda 96 vs Melbourne 112 -> false
- Richmond 104 vs Essendon 99 -> false
- Footscray 87 vs Collingwood 65 -> false
- North Melbourne 71 vs Carlton 121 -> false

4) Count matches with equal total points (draws)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS equal_score_count
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) = CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER);
Result: 0

Conclusion
- There are zero matches in the available dataset where the home team’s total points equal the away team’s total points. Therefore, the claim that there are 2 such matches is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "same score" refers to equality of total points (the integer inside parentheses in the score string), which determines a draw in Australian rules football.
- The claim pertains to the matches contained in the available dataset (the 6 matches recorded, dated 18 June 1938).
