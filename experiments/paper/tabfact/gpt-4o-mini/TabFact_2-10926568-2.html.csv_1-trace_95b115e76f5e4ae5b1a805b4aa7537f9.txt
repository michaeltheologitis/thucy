Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: The user asserts that episode number 202 aired on February 4, 2008.

Data source exploration
- Discovered available data source: a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: cities_of_the_underworld.
- Schema inspection shows columns: "production no" (bigint), "episode no" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "episode title" (text), "host" (text).

Evidence from data
- I queried the table for the record where episode no = 202.
- Result returned:
  - Episode No: 202
  - Episode Title: Vietnam
  - Original Airdate: February 4, 2008

Executed SQL (as evidence)
SELECT "episode no", "episode title", "original airdate"
FROM cities_of_the_underworld
WHERE "episode no" = 202;

Conclusion
- The data shows that episode number 202 (Vietnam) has an original airdate of February 4, 2008. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "Episode number 202" is interpreted as the value in the "episode no" column of the cities_of_the_underworld dataset.
