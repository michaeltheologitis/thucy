Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public containing one table: public.my_info_table.
- Table columns: rank (bigint), player (text), years (text), games (bigint), "reb avg" (double precision), "total rebounds" (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Determine the maximum total rebounds recorded in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX("total rebounds") AS max_rebounds FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: 1048

2) Check whether any entry exceeds 1048 total rebounds
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "total rebounds" > 1048;
Result: 0

Findings:
- The maximum value in the "total rebounds" column is exactly 1048.
- There are zero rows where "total rebounds" is greater than 1048.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available data in public.my_info_table, there is no entry with rebounds greater than 1048. This supports the user’s claim under the reasonable interpretation that “rebound larger than 1048” refers to the table’s "total rebounds" field.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the phrase “game that have rebound” as referring to entries (players/rows) in the provided table and the phrase “rebound larger than 1048” as the "total rebounds" column. The dataset does not contain per-game records, so verification was performed on the available aggregate (per-row) totals.
