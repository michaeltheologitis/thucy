Claim: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Good Old Boy beer did not win a single award between 1995 and 2009.”

Data sources consulted:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: west_berkshire_brewery. Columns: year, beer name, prize, category, competition. Each row represents an award/placement for a beer in a given year.

Evidence found (awards for Good Old Boy, 1995–2009 inclusive):
- 1995: Overall Winner — Beer of the Festival — CAMRA White Horse Branch Beer Festival
- 2002: Gold Medal — Best Bitter — SIBA South East Region Beer Competition
- 2002: Second Reserve Champion — Overall — SIBA South East Region Beer Competition
- 2005: Silver Medal — Best Bitter — SIBA South East Region Beer Competition
- 2009: Gold Medal — In Category — CAMRA London and South East Regional Competition

Executed SQL queries (exact):
1) Listing awards
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition 
FROM west_berkshire_brewery 
WHERE LOWER("beer name") = LOWER('Good Old Boy') 
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;

2) Counting awards
SELECT COUNT(*) AS award_count
FROM west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE LOWER("beer name") = LOWER('Good Old Boy')
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;

Outcome of queries:
- Count returned: 5 awards between 1995 and 2009 inclusive.
- Detailed rows list specific prizes and competitions in 1995, 2002 (two awards), 2005, and 2009.

Conclusion:
- The data directly contradicts the claim. Good Old Boy won multiple awards between 1995 and 2009.

Assumptions:
- Beer name matching was performed case-insensitively on the exact string "Good Old Boy" as stored in the data. No partial-name matching was required since exact-name records were present.
