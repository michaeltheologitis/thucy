Claim: “Lleyton Hewitt won the Masters Series 2 times, in 2004 and 2005.”

Conclusion: He did win two ATP Masters Series titles, but they occurred in 2002 and 2003 (both at Indian Wells), not in 2004 or 2005. In 2004 and 2005 he was runner-up at Cincinnati and Indian Wells, respectively.

Data source checked
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: lleyton_hewitt (columns: outcome, year, championship, surface, opponent, score)

Step 1: Explore available championships to ground the context
Result (selected distinct championships in this table): Paris; Stuttgart; Cincinnati; Indian Wells; Indian Wells (2); Cincinnati (2)
Executed SQL:
SELECT championship, COUNT(*) AS record_count 
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt 
GROUP BY championship;

Step 2: Identify all title-winning entries for Hewitt
Result (title wins):
- 2002 — Indian Wells — Opponent: Tim Henman — Score: 6 - 1, 6 - 2
- 2003 — Indian Wells (2) — Opponent: Gustavo Kuerten — Score: 6 - 1, 6 - 1
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, championship, opponent, score 
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt 
WHERE outcome ILIKE '%Winner%' OR outcome ILIKE '%Champion%' OR outcome ILIKE '%Won%';

Step 3: Check results specifically in 2004 and 2005
Result (no titles; runner-up finishes):
- 2004 — Cincinnati (2) — Outcome: runner - up — Opponent: Andre Agassi — Score: 3 - 6 , 6 - 3 , 2 - 6
- 2005 — Indian Wells — Outcome: runner - up — Opponent: Roger Federer — Score: 2 - 6 , 4 - 6 , 4 - 6
Executed SQL:
SELECT outcome, year, championship, opponent, score
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt
WHERE year IN (2004, 2005);

Assessment of the claim
- True: Hewitt has two Masters Series (Masters 1000) titles in total.
- False: The years cited (2004 and 2005) are incorrect; his wins were in 2002 and 2003. In the cited years he was runner-up.

Assumptions
- “master series” is interpreted as ATP Masters Series (now called ATP Masters 1000) tournaments.
- “ileyton hewitt” refers to Lleyton Hewitt.
