Data source explored: public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters (music tracks table)
Relevant columns: track (track number), song title (title)

Evidence 1: Retrieve the title for track number 23
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "song title" FROM public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters WHERE track = 23;
- Result: he'll have to go

Evidence 2: Check if any track has the title 'just a little bit'
- Executed SQL:
SELECT track FROM public.walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters WHERE LOWER("song title") = LOWER('just a little bit');
- Result: track = 9

Conclusion: In this dataset, track 23 is titled "he'll have to go", while "just a little bit" corresponds to track 9. Therefore, the claim that track 23 has the title "just a little bit" is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "track 23" refers to the value in the 'track' column within the table walk_a_mile_in_my_shoes_the_essential_70s_masters.
- The claim pertains to this specific dataset.
