Claim to verify: In 2012, the Oakland Raiders lost to the Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium with a result of 15-0.

Findings based on the rivalry dataset (public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry):
- There were two Chiefs–Raiders games in 2012. The Raiders won both games.
  - October 28, 2012: Oakland Raiders 26 - 16 Kansas City Chiefs at Arrowhead Stadium.
  - December 16, 2012: Oakland Raiders 15 - 0 Kansas City Chiefs at O.co Coliseum (Oakland), not at Arrowhead.
- Therefore, the specific claim that the Raiders lost 15-0 at Arrowhead in 2012 is contradicted by the data. The 15-0 result occurred in Oakland, and the Raiders were the winners.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all 2012 games between the Chiefs and Raiders
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, date, winner, result, loser, location FROM public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry WHERE year = 2012;
Result returned by the database:
- Date: October 28 | Year: 2012 | Winner: Oakland Raiders | Result: 26 - 16 | Loser: Kansas City Chiefs | Location: Arrowhead Stadium
- Date: December 16 | Year: 2012 | Winner: Oakland Raiders | Result: 15 - 0 | Loser: Kansas City Chiefs | Location: O.co Coliseum

2) Find the 2012 game with a 15 - 0 score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, winner, loser, location FROM public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry WHERE year = 2012 AND result = '15 - 0';
Result returned by the database:
- Date: December 16 | Winner: Oakland Raiders | Loser: Kansas City Chiefs | Location: O.co Coliseum

3) Retrieve the 2012 game played at Arrowhead Stadium
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, winner, result, loser, location FROM public.chiefs_raiders_rivalry WHERE year = 2012 AND location ILIKE '%Arrowhead%';
Result returned by the database:
- Date: October 28 | Winner: Oakland Raiders | Result: 26 - 16 | Loser: Kansas City Chiefs | Location: Arrowhead Stadium

Conclusion: The claim is incorrect. In 2012, the Raiders did not lose 15-0 at Arrowhead. Instead, they beat the Chiefs 26-16 at Arrowhead (Oct 28) and 15-0 at O.co Coliseum (Dec 16).

Assumptions made:

- “Arrowhead Stadium” refers to the Chiefs’ home stadium in Kansas City, MO.
- The chiefs_raiders_rivalry table comprehensively records Chiefs–Raiders game results for the period in question.
