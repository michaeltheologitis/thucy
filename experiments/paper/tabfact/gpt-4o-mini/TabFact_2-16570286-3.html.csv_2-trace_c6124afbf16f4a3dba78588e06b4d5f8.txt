Claim interpreted: In the 1948 Ashes series, no England player took as many wickets as Bill Johnston.

Evidence from the data source (public.t_1948_ashes_series):

1) Bill Johnston’s wicket total
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Bill Johnston');
- Result: 27 wickets

2) Teams present and their presence in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series;
- Result: England, Australia

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS count_per_team FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series GROUP BY team;
- Result: England: 3 players; Australia: 4 players

3) Players, teams, and wickets (ordered by team and wickets)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, team, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series ORDER BY team, wickets DESC;
- Result:
  Australia — Ray Lindwall: 27; Bill Johnston: 27; Keith Miller: 13; Ernie Toshack: 11
  England — Alec Bedser: 18; Norman Yardley: 9; Jim Laker: 9

Analysis:
- Bill Johnston (Australia) took 27 wickets.
- The highest wicket tally among England players in this dataset is 18 (Alec Bedser), which is fewer than 27.
- Therefore, no England player matched or exceeded Bill Johnston’s wicket total in the 1948 Ashes series according to this table.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in public.t_1948_ashes_series.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers specifically to the 1948 Ashes series, which aligns with the available dataset scope.
