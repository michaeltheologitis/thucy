Summary conclusion: In the available 1962 VFL season dataset, there is no record of a Footscray vs Fitzroy game played at Windy Hill. The only match at Windy Hill in this dataset is Essendon vs Geelong on 23 June 1962.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check specifically for Footscray vs Fitzroy at Windy Hill
SQL: SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE ("home team" = 'Footscray' AND "away team" = 'Fitzroy' AND venue = 'Windy Hill') OR ("home team" = 'Fitzroy' AND "away team" = 'Footscray' AND venue = 'Windy Hill') ORDER BY date;
Result: No rows returned.

2) List all matches in the dataset (to show what is recorded and the Windy Hill game that does exist)
SQL: SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Returned rows:
- 23 June 1962 | Melbourne vs St Kilda | MCG
- 23 June 1962 | Essendon vs Geelong | Windy Hill
- 23 June 1962 | Collingwood vs Fitzroy | Victoria Park
- 23 June 1962 | Carlton vs Footscray | Princes Park
- 23 June 1962 | South Melbourne vs Richmond | Lake Oval
- 23 June 1962 | North Melbourne vs Hawthorn | Arden Street Oval

3) Check if Footscray played at Windy Hill at all (in this dataset)
SQL: SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE venue = 'Windy Hill' AND ("home team" = 'Footscray' OR "away team" = 'Footscray');
Result: No rows returned.

4) Check if Fitzroy played at Windy Hill at all (in this dataset)
SQL: SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE venue = 'Windy Hill' AND ("home team" = 'Fitzroy' OR "away team" = 'Fitzroy');
Result: No rows returned.

5) Verify exact team name spellings used in the dataset (to ensure correct matching)
SQL (home teams): SELECT DISTINCT "home team" FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
SQL (away teams): SELECT DISTINCT "away team" FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Returned distinct values confirm spellings include Footscray and Fitzroy among the away teams, and do not indicate any alternative spelling needed for this check.

Conclusion based on data: Within the accessible 1962 VFL season dataset, there is no evidence of a Footscray vs Fitzroy match at Windy Hill; therefore the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The only available data source is a single table (public.t_1962_vfl_season) that contains matches dated 23 June 1962. I interpreted the claim within the scope of this dataset. The conclusion does not assert anything about other seasons or dates not present in this data.
