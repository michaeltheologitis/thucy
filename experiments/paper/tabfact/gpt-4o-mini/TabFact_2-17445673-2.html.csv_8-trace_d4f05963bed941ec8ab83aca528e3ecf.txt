Summary
I verified whether the shortest-duration match was a win against Borislav Jeliazkov by analyzing the fights recorded in the public.tim_lajcik table and computing each fight’s duration in seconds.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public
- Table: tim_lajcik(res text, record text, opponent text, method text, event text, round bigint, time text)

Evidence and results
1) Identify the shortest-duration fight (by computing seconds from mm:ss) and ordering ascending
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, event, method, round, time, 
       (CAST(split_part(time, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 + 
        CAST(split_part(time, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS time_seconds_num 
FROM tim_lajcik 
WHERE time ~ '^[0-9]{1,2}:[0-9]{2}$' 
ORDER BY time_seconds_num ASC;
Key returned rows (ascending by time_seconds_num):
- 18 sec: res = win, opponent = joe campanella, event = ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7, method = tko, round = 1, time = 0:18
- 80 sec: res = win, opponent = paul devich, event = ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2, method = tko, round = 1, time = 1:20
- 143 sec: res = loss, opponent = borislav jeliazkov, event = rings : king of kings 1999 block b, method = submission (rear naked choke), round = 1, time = 2:23
Conclusion from this query: The shortest fight on record is 18 seconds, a win over Joe Campanella—not against Borislav Jeliazkov.

2) Check if there is any win recorded against Borislav Jeliazkov
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, event, method, round, time 
FROM public.tim_lajcik 
WHERE opponent = 'Borislav Jeliazkov' AND res = 'Win';
Result: No rows returned. This indicates there is no recorded win against Borislav Jeliazkov in this dataset.

3) Retrieve the fight(s) against Borislav Jeliazkov to confirm result and timing
Executed SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, event, method, round, time,
       (CAST(split_part(time, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 + CAST(split_part(time, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS time_seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik
WHERE lower(opponent) LIKE '%borislav jeliazkov%';
Returned row:
- res = Loss, opponent = Borislav Jeliazkov, event = Rings : King of Kings 1999 Block B, method = Submission (Rear Naked Choke), round = 1, time = 2:23, time_seconds = 143
This confirms Tim Lajcik lost to Borislav Jeliazkov in 143 seconds; there is no win against this opponent.

Conclusion
The shortest-duration match in the dataset is a 18-second win against Joe Campanella, not a win against Borislav Jeliazkov. In fact, the record shows a loss to Borislav Jeliazkov in 2:23.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the request “the match with the shortest time be win against borislav jeliazkov” as the claim: “The shortest-time match in Tim Lajcik’s record was a win against Borislav Jeliazkov.”
