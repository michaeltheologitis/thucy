Claim to verify: “there be only one year (1983) with a title of kriegspiel in the genre arcade.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema with table public.beyond_software
- Table columns: title (text), genre (text), c = 64 (text), zx spectrum (text), others (text), year (bigint), format (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any ‘Kriegspiel’ in genre ‘Arcade’ (case-insensitive)
- Result: 0 records; no years found.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM public.beyond_software WHERE LOWER(title) = 'kriegspiel' AND LOWER(genre) = 'arcade';
  Result: 0

  SELECT year, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.beyond_software WHERE LOWER(title) = 'kriegspiel' AND LOWER(genre) = 'arcade' GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
  Result: No records

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count, ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT year) AS distinct_years 
  FROM public.beyond_software 
  WHERE LOWER(title) = 'kriegspiel' 
  AND LOWER(genre) = 'arcade';
  Result: record_count = 0, distinct_years = NULL

2) Identify any ‘Kriegspiel’ titles regardless of genre to see what exists in the data
- Result: One record found — title: “kriegspiel”, genre: “strategy”, year: 1983.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT title, genre, year 
  FROM public.beyond_software 
  WHERE title ILIKE '%krieg%';
  Result:
  - title = kriegspiel, genre = strategy, year = 1983

3) Confirm distinct years for titles containing ‘kriegspiel’
- Result: Only 1983 present; 1 record total.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.beyond_software WHERE title ILIKE '%kriegspiel%';
  Result: 1983

  SELECT title, genre, year FROM public.beyond_software WHERE title ILIKE '%kriegspiel%';
  Result: title = kriegspiel, genre = strategy, year = 1983

Conclusion
- The database contains an entry for “kriegspiel” in year 1983, but its genre is “strategy,” not “arcade.”
- There are zero records for “kriegspiel” with genre “arcade” in any year. Therefore, the claim that there is “only one year (1983) with a title of kriegspiel in the genre arcade” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Title and genre comparisons use case-insensitive matching (LOWER/ILIKE) to capture potential capitalization differences.
- The term “genre arcade” is interpreted as genre exactly equal to “arcade,” case-insensitive. The dataset’s public.beyond_software table is treated as authoritative for this verification.
