Claim interpreted: The user appears to assert that the male character “Bounder” does not appear in the books (i.e., “the male Bounder [in the] book: no”).

Data sources discovered
- Available database: public schema
- Table: list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters (columns include: animal name, species, books, tv series, gender, tv seasons, mate, first appearance, last appearance)

Evidence
1) Identify whether “bounder” exists and its gender
Executed SQL:
SELECT "animal name", species, gender FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters LIMIT 200;
Result excerpt shows:
- animal name: bounder, species: fox, gender: male

2) Retrieve full record for “bounder” to check book appearances
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_animals_of_farthing_wood_characters WHERE "animal name" = 'bounder';
Result:
- Animal Name: bounder
- Species: fox
- Books: yes (unnamed)
- TV Series: yes
- Gender: male
- TV Seasons: 2
- Mate: unknown
- First Appearance: a joke backfires (2x05)
- Last Appearance: like father, like son (2x08)

Assessment
- The table identifies “bounder” as a male fox and explicitly indicates Books: “yes (unnamed).” This directly contradicts the claim that the male Bounder is not in the books. While the database notes he is unnamed in the books, it still affirms a book appearance.

Conclusion: The claim that the male Bounder does not appear in the books is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s phrase “the male bounder book be no” as the claim: “The male character Bounder does not appear in the books.”
