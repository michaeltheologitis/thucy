Claim to verify: “the title of every episode in season 1 mention both gary and allison.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with a table named public.gary_unmarried that lists episodes of the show “Gary Unmarried.”
- Schema (public.gary_unmarried):
  - episode (text): Episode title
  - air date (text)
  - timeslot (text)
  - 18 - 49 (text)
  - viewers (double precision)

Evidence
1) Season context and episode listing
- I retrieved all rows to see the episode titles and air dates (they span Sep 2008 – May 2009, which corresponds to Season 1 and the table contains 20 episodes):
  SQL:
  SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried ORDER BY "air date" ASC;
  Result (Episode Title | Air Date):
  - pilot | september 24 , 2008
  - gary gets boundaries | october 1 , 2008

  - gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal | may 20 , 2009
  - gary and the trophy | april 8 , 2009

2) Total number of episodes in the table
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM public.gary_unmarried;
  Result: 20

3) Episodes whose titles contain both “gary” and “allison” (case-insensitive)
  SQL:
  SELECT episode FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE episode ILIKE '%gary%' AND episode ILIKE '%allison%';
  Results (4 titles):
  - gary and allison 's restaurant
  - gary and allison brooks
  - gary hooks up allison
  - gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal

4) Episodes whose titles do NOT contain both “gary” and “allison” (case-insensitive)
  Listing query used:
  SQL:
  SELECT episode FROM gary_unmarried WHERE LOWER(episode) NOT LIKE '%gary%' OR LOWER(episode) NOT LIKE '%allison%';
  Results (16 titles):
  - pilot
  - gary gets boundaries
  - gary marries off his ex
  - gary gets his stuff back
  - gary breaks up his ex - wife and girlfriend
  - gary meets the gang
  - gary gives thanks
  - gary goes first
  - gary toughens up tom
  - gary dates louise 's teacher
  - gary moves back in
  - gary and dennis' sister
  - gary 's ex - brother - in - law
  - gary uses his veto
  - gary and the trophy
  - gary and his half brother

  Count using a single boolean condition:
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM gary_unmarried WHERE NOT (LOWER(episode) LIKE '%gary%' AND LOWER(episode) LIKE '%allison%');
  Result: 16

Conclusion
- Only 4 out of 20 episode titles contain both “gary” and “allison.” Therefore, it is not true that every Season 1 episode title mentions both names.

Assumptions
- The table public.gary_unmarried corresponds to Season 1 of “Gary Unmarried” (supported by the 2008–2009 air dates and 20-episode count).
- Matching for names is case-insensitive and based on substring presence within the title (punctuation and spacing variations are disregarded).
