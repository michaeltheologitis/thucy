Summary
The claim states that construction was completed in 1993 for the Flowood site and in 1997 for the Newsome Brother/Old Reichhold Chemical project. Evidence from the Mississippi Superfund sites database confirms both years.

Evidence
1) Flowood site
- Result: Site Name = Flowood Site; County = Rankin; Construction Completed = 09 / 17 / 1993
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, county, "construction completed" 
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
WHERE "name" = 'Flowood' OR "name" ILIKE 'Flowood%';

2) Newsome/Old Reichhold Chemicals site
- Result: Site Name = newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc; County = marion; Construction Completed = 08 / 08 / 1997
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "county", "construction completed" 
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
WHERE ("name" ILIKE '%Newsome%' OR "name" ILIKE '%Newsom%') 
AND "name" ILIKE '%Reichhold%';

Conclusion
- Flowood Site construction completion date is 09/17/1993 → supports “1993”.
- Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc construction completion date is 08/08/1997 → supports “1997”.

Assumptions
- “flowood site” refers to the Superfund listing “Flowood Site” (Rankin County, MS).
- “newsome brother / old reichold chemical project” refers to the Superfund listing “Newsom Brothers/Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc” (Marion County, MS).
