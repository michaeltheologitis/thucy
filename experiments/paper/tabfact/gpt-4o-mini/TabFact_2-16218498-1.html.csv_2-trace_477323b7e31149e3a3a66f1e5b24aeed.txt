Claim: “there be only 2 game where the score be 0 - 0 for the 1st leg.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: public schema containing table t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs).
- Relevant columns: team 1 (text), team 2 (text), 1st leg (text), 2nd leg (text), agg (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count ties with a first-leg score of 0-0 (allowing optional spaces around the hyphen)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE TRIM(REPLACE("1st leg", ' ', '')) = '0-0';
Result: 2

2) List those ties (teams and first-leg score)
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg"
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE TRIM(REPLACE("1st leg", ' ', '')) = '0-0';
Results:
- Port Autonome vs Sporting Clube da Praia — 1st leg: 0 - 0
- Tourbillon FC vs Forces Armées CA — 1st leg: 0 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 2 ties where the first-leg score was 0-0, supporting the claim.

Assumptions
- “Game” refers to a tie (row) in t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- A 0-0 score is matched by normalizing spaces around the hyphen (e.g., “0 - 0” and “0-0”).
- Verification is based solely on the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs dataset available in the connected database.
