Claim interpreted: “Phil Mickelson is the only player from the United States.” Given the available data source (1996 PGA Championship table), I assess this claim within that context.

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Finding: A PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_1996_pga_championship.

Step 2: Inspect schema
- Table: t_1996_pga_championship
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint)

Step 3: Check distribution of player nationalities
Evidence (Executed SQL):
SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY player_count DESC;

Result:
- United States: 7 players
- Sweden: 2 players
- Zimbabwe: 1 player
- New Zealand: 1 player
- Australia: 1 player
- Fiji: 1 player

Step 4: Verify whether Phil Mickelson is from the United States and whether he is the only one
Evidence (Executed SQL 1 – exact match after trimming whitespace):
SELECT player, TRIM(country) AS country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE TRIM(country) = 'United States';

Evidence (Executed SQL 2 – case-insensitive contains match):
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE LOWER(country) LIKE '%united states%';

Result (players from United States):
- Mark Brooks
- Kenny Perry
- Tommy Tolles
- Justin Leonard
- Lee Janzen
- Phil Mickelson
- Larry Mize

Conclusion
- The data show seven players from the United States in the 1996 PGA Championship, including Phil Mickelson. Therefore, within the scope of this dataset, the statement that Phil Mickelson is the only player from the United States is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity
- Because the user’s claim lacked context, I assumed it pertained to the available data source (the 1996 PGA Championship table) as the relevant domain for verification.
