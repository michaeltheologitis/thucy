Claim assessed: "Season 3 of Dexter began airing after October 2008."

Conclusion: The claim is false. Season 3 began airing on September 28, 2008, which is before October 2008.

Evidence from the data
- Data source discovery: PostgreSQL database with a table public.dexter_season_3.
- Schema check: Table dexter_season_3 includes a column "original air date" (text) storing each episode’s original air date.

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT "no in season", title, "original air date" 
FROM public.dexter_season_3 
ORDER BY "no in season" ASC;

Key returned rows (ordered by episode number in the season):
1 | our father | september 28 , 2008
2 | finding freebo | october 5 , 2008
3 | the lion sleeps tonight | october 12 , 2008
4 | all in the family | october 19 , 2008
5 | turning biminese | october 26 , 2008
6 | sá se puede | november 2 , 2008
...

Interpretation: Episode 1 of Season 3 aired on September 28, 2008, so the season began before October 2008, directly contradicting the claim that it began after October 2008.

Assumptions:
- "Begin air" is interpreted as the original U.S. premiere date of Season 3’s first episode, as reflected by the "original air date" column in the provided dataset.
