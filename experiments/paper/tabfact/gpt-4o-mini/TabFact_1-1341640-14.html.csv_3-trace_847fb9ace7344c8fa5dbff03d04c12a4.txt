Claim interpreted: “Paul Findley (Illinois’s 20th district) was first elected after Henry Hyde (Illinois’s 6th district).”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence retrieved
1) Row listing for the 1980 House elections table (includes both districts and their incumbents’ first-elected years):
SQL executed:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980;

Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Illinois 6 | Henry Hyde | Republican | 1974 | Re-elected | Henry Hyde (R) 67.0%, Mario Reymond Reda (D) 33.0%
- Illinois 20 | Paul Findley | Republican | 1960 | Re-elected | Paul Findley (R) 56.0%, David Robinson (D) 44.0%

Analysis
- Henry Hyde (IL-6) first elected: 1974
- Paul Findley (IL-20) first elected: 1960
- Comparison: 1960 (Findley) precedes 1974 (Hyde). Therefore, Paul Findley was first elected before Henry Hyde, not after.

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data: Paul Findley’s first election year (1960) is earlier than Henry Hyde’s (1974).

Assumptions
- “First elected” refers to the first year elected to the U.S. House of Representatives for the named incumbents, as reported in the 1980 elections table.
