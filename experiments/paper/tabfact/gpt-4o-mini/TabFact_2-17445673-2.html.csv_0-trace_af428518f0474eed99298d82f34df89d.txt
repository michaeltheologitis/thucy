Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: tim_lajcik (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)

What I checked:
- I examined the distribution of match results in the res column to see how many ended in a draw.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Distinct result values and their counts
SQL:
SELECT res, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.tim_lajcik
GROUP BY res;
Result summary:
- loss: 6
- draw: 1
- win: 7

2) Total number of rows (sanity check)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_count
FROM public.tim_lajcik;
Result:
- total_count: 14

Conclusion:
- The table shows exactly 1 row where res = 'draw'. Therefore, only one match in this dataset resulted in a draw.

Assumptions:
- “Match” refers to each row in public.tim_lajcik.
- A “draw” is recorded via res = 'draw' (case as stored).
