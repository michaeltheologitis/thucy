Claim to verify: “All matches held in November at Twickenham, London are tour matches.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (authoritative within scope)
- Table: public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
  - Columns: opposing team (text), against (bigint), date (text), venue (text), status (text)

Evidence
1) Identify all matches at Twickenham, London
SQL executed:
SELECT date, venue, status, "opposing team", against 
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Twickenham%';
Result:
- 28 October 1978 | Twickenham, London | Tour match | London Counties | 12
- 25 November 1978 | Twickenham, London | Test match | England | 6

2) Identify all November matches at Twickenham, London
SQL executed:
SELECT date, venue, status, "opposing team", against 
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Twickenham%' AND date ILIKE '%November%';
Result:
- 25 November 1978 | Twickenham, London | Test Match | England | 6

Assessment
- The only November match at Twickenham in the available data is explicitly labeled “Test match,” not “Tour match.” Therefore, the claim that all November matches at Twickenham are tour matches is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate according to the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to entries in the table t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland (1978 New Zealand tour).
- “Held in November” is identified via the text month name “November” in the date field.
- “Twickenham, London” corresponds to the venue field containing that exact location string.
