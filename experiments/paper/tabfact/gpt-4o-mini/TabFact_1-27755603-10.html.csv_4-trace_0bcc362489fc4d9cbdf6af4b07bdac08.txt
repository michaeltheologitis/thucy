Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. There are 4 instances during the covered 2010–2011 Detroit Pistons period where multiple Pistons players tied for the team-high in rebounds.

What I checked
- I explored the available data source and found a table containing Pistons game summaries for a March 2011 segment of the 2010–2011 season (Games 62–73). I then identified rows where the “high rebounds” field lists multiple players (a tie) and counted them.

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify the table structure
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 't_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season';
Result (abridged columns): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

2) Determine the covered game range
SQL:
SELECT MIN(game) AS min_game, MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season;
Result: min_game = 62, max_game = 73

SQL:
SELECT game, date FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE game IN (SELECT MIN(game) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season) OR game IN (SELECT MAX(game) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season);
Result:
- Game 62: March 1
- Game 73: March 26

3) Count ties for most rebounds
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%';
Result: 4

4) List the specific games with ties
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "high rebounds" FROM public.t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%,%' ORDER BY game ASC;
Results:
- Game 62 (March 1 vs. Milwaukee): Greg Monroe, Charlie Villanueva (9)
- Game 64 (March 6 vs. Washington): Greg Monroe, Rodney Stuckey (7)
- Game 67 (March 12 vs. Denver): Austin Daye, Ben Gordon, Greg Monroe (6)
- Game 72 (March 25 vs. Cleveland): Chris Wilcox, Greg Monroe (8)

Assessment
- Count of ties in this period = 4, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “This period of the 2010–2011 season” is interpreted as the games present in the connected dataset: Detroit Pistons Games 62–73 (March 1–26, 2011).
