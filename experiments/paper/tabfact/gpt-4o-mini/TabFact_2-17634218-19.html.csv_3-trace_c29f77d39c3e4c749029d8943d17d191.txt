Claim interpreted: “the first record be record in November of the year 1965.” I interpret “first record” to mean the earliest chronologically recorded ‘first’ date in the available dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_sumo_record_holders (columns: name, total, first, last, highest rank)

Evidence and analysis
1) Quick check of the raw minimum text value in the ‘first’ column (note: this is lexicographic, not chronological)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MIN(first) AS earliest_first FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE first IS NOT NULL;
- Result: January 2001
- Note: Because ‘first’ stores Month YYYY as text, a plain MIN() compares strings alphabetically (e.g., “January” < “November”), which does not give the true chronological earliest.

2) Chronological ordering by parsing ‘first’ (Month YYYY) as a date
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, first FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders ORDER BY TO_DATE(first, 'Month YYYY') ASC LIMIT 5;
- Result (top 5 earliest):
  1. name: hasegawa, first: November 1965
  2. name: daikirin, first: November 1966
  3. name: takamiyama, first: November 1969
  4. name: akinoshima, first: November 1988
  5. name: kotonishiki, first: September 1990
- This shows the earliest ‘first’ month-year is November 1965.

3) Explicitly compute the minimum parsed date and return the associated name and original text
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(first, 'Month YYYY')) AS earliest_date, first, name 
  FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders 
  GROUP BY first, name 
  ORDER BY earliest_date ASC LIMIT 1;
- Result: earliest_date = November 1, 1965; first = "november 1965"; name = "hasegawa"
- This confirms the earliest month-year in the ‘first’ field is November 1965.

Conclusion
- The earliest (i.e., “first”) record in this dataset is indeed recorded in November 1965.

Assumptions
- “First record” refers to the chronologically earliest value in the ‘first’ column of public.list_of_sumo_record_holders.
- The ‘first’ field stores month and year (no day), and parsing with TO_DATE('Month YYYY') is the correct way to compare chronologically.
