Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema containing table t_1961_vfl_season with columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

Evidence 1: Highest single-game crowd and its venue
- Result: Venue = MCG; Crowd = 49,678; Home Team = Melbourne; Away Team = Carlton; Date = 3 June 1961
- Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, crowd, "home team", "away team", date 
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season 
WHERE crowd = (SELECT MAX(crowd) FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season)

Evidence 2: Maximum single-game crowd by venue (top results)

  - Kardinia Park — 18,683
  - Glenferrie Oval — 15,000
  - Lake Oval — 14,500

- Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd 
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season 
GROUP BY venue 
ORDER BY max_crowd DESC 
LIMIT 10;

Conclusion
- The data shows the highest single-game crowd recorded in the dataset for the 1961 VFL season occurred at the MCG. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available evidence.
