Claim interpreted: The game with the lowest attendance in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Royals.

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Available table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
- Relevant columns: date (text; values like "may 3"), opponent (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence 1 — Identify the minimum-attendance May game(s):
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may%'
AND attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance)
                 FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
                 WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may%')
ORDER BY attendance ASC;
Result:
- Date: May 3, Opponent: Royals, Attendance: 20,809

Evidence 2 — Corroborate by listing the lowest-attendance May games:
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, attendance
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may%'
ORDER BY attendance ASC
LIMIT 10;
Top results (attendance ascending):
1) May 3 — Royals — 20,809
2) May 5 — Royals — 22,588
3) May 4 — Royals — 22,628
4) May 21 — Athletics — 22,738
5) May 2 — Royals — 22,896
6) May 20 — Athletics — 24,631
7) May 24 — Angels — 26,408
8) May 17 — White Sox — 30,095
9) May 1 — Rangers — 33,439
10) May 22 — Athletics — 34,028

Conclusion: The game with the lowest attendance in May 1991 for the Toronto Blue Jays was indeed against the Royals (May 3, 20,809 attendees). This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- "royal" refers to the Kansas City Royals.
- The table represents the 1991 season, and the date text like "may 3" corresponds to May 1991.
- If multiple games tied for the minimum, all would have been reported; here, one game holds the minimum.
