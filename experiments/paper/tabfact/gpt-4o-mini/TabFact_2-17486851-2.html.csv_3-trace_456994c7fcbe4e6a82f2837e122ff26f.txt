Summary
- Interpreted claim: Within the available dataset, there exists a record where nat = mkd and the corresponding name is nikolovski.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
- Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text), source (text)

Evidence
1) Distinct nationality codes present (shows that mkd exists)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT nat, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY nat ASC;
Result:
- bra: 1
- cyp: 6
- gre: 2
- mkd: 1
- por: 1
- ser: 1

2) Retrieve all rows where nat = 'mkd' (shows the associated name)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat = 'mkd';
Result (single row):
- nat: mkd
- name: nikolovski
- moving to: aep paphos
- type: mutual consent
- transfer window: winter
- transfer fee: free
- source: -

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one row where nat = mkd, and the name for that row is nikolovski. This supports the claim within the context of the available APOEL FC 2008-09 season data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the nat mkd have the name nikolovski" to mean: in the table t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season, there is at least one record with nat equal to mkd and that record’s name equals nikolovski.
- Treated nat values as case-sensitive (the stored value is lowercase mkd).
