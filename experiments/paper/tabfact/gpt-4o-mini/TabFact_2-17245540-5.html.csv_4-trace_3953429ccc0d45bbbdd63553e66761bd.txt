Summary
Claim: “Bob Charles, from New Zealand, be tie for 3rd.”
Data-driven finding: In the available dataset for the 1973 U.S. Open Golf, the player Bob Charles (country: New Zealand) appears with place = T3 (i.e., tied for 3rd). This supports the claim within the scope of this dataset.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf (1973 U.S. Open Golf-related data).

Schema exploration
1) Column information
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, column_default, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1973_u_s_open_golf';

Result (concise):
- place (text)
- player (text)
- country (text)
- score (text)
- to par (text)

2) Primary key information
Executed SQL:
SELECT kcu.column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints tco
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage kcu
  ON kcu.constraint_name = tco.constraint_name
  AND kcu.table_name = tco.table_name
WHERE tco.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY'
  AND tco.table_schema = 'public'
  AND tco.table_name = 't_1973_u_s_open_golf';

Result:
- No primary key defined for this table.

Verification steps and evidence
Step 1: Direct lookup for Bob Charles
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE lower(player) = 'bob charles';

Result:
- Place: T3
- Player: Bob Charles
- Country: New Zealand
- Score: 71 + 69 = 140
- To Par: -2

Step 2: Cross-check all entries with place indicating tied for 3rd
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place ILIKE 'T3%';

Result (abbreviated to relevant rows):
- country: new zealand | place: t3 | player: bob charles | score: 71 + 69 = 140 | to par: - 2
(Additional T3 rows present for other players, confirming T3 is used for tie for 3rd in this dataset.)

Conclusion
The dataset shows Bob Charles (country: New Zealand) with place = T3, consistent with “tied for 3rd.” Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the event captured by the available dataset (1973 U.S. Open Golf) and interprets “tie for 3rd” as place = 'T3' in this table.
- Minor differences in capitalization (e.g., “New Zealand” vs “new zealand”) do not affect the verification of the claim’s substance.
