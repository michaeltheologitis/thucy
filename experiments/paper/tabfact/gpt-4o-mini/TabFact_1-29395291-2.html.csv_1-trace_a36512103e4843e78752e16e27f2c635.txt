Summary conclusion: The data shows that for provider 'glo mobile', the maximum value of subscribers (2006) (thousands) is 11000. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Evidence from the database
1) Identify relevant provider entries
- Result: provider values containing 'glo' include only 'glo mobile'.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT provider FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa WHERE provider ILIKE '%glo%';

2) Retrieve 2005/2006 subscriber counts for 'glo mobile'
- Result rows:
  - country: Nigeria; subscribers (2005) (thousands): 9000; subscribers (2006) (thousands): 11000
- Executed SQL:
SELECT country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)"
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE provider = 'glo mobile';

3) Compute maximum 2006 subscribers for 'glo mobile'
- Result: 11000 (thousands)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX("subscribers (2006) (thousands)") AS max_subscribers_2006 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa 
WHERE provider = 'glo mobile';

Interpretation
- The table stores subscriber counts in thousands. The maximum 2006 subscriber value for 'glo mobile' in the dataset is 11000 (i.e., 11,000 thousand = 11,000,000), which matches the claim's numeric value (11000 in table units).

Assumptions
- "2006 subscriber" refers to the column "subscribers (2006) (thousands)".
- "Maximum number ... for glo mobile" is interpreted as the maximum across all rows in the dataset where provider = 'glo mobile'.
