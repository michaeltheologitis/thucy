Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a table containing results for the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships.
- Inspected the table schema to understand available fields.
- Retrieved rows for Mark Cockerell and Patrice Macrez.
- Compared their results on rank, points, and places.

Data source discovery
- Executed SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE' AND table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog','information_schema');
- Result: Found table public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships.

Table schema inspection
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Columns:
  - rank (bigint)
  - name (text)
  - nation (text)
  - sp + fs (bigint)
  - points (double precision)
  - places (double precision)

Retrieve relevant skaters
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, nation, rank, "sp + fs" as sp_fs, points, places FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE LOWER(name) IN ('mark cockerell','patrice macrez') ORDER BY rank ASC;
- Results:
  - Mark Cockerell — Nation: United States; Rank: 1; Points: 172.42; Places: 11; Short Program + Free Skate: 1
  - Patrice Macrez — Nation: France; Rank: 7; Points: 151.76; Places: 71; Short Program + Free Skate: 6

Direct comparison
- Executed SQL:
WITH m AS (SELECT * FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE LOWER(name)='mark cockerell'),
     p AS (SELECT * FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE LOWER(name)='patrice macrez')
SELECT (m.points > p.points) AS mark_higher_points,
       (m.rank < p.rank) AS mark_better_rank,
       (m.places < p.places) AS mark_lower_places
FROM m, p;
- Results:
  - Higher Points: true
  - Better Rank: true
  - Lower Places: true

Conclusion
- In the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships data, Mark Cockerell finished ahead of Patrice Macrez by all available measures (better final rank, higher points, and lower places). This supports the claim that he finished with a better score.

Assumptions
- "partice macrez" refers to Patrice Macrez.
- "finish with a better score" is interpreted in the context of this dataset as achieving a better final standing; both the higher points and lower places corroborate this.
