Claim to verify:
"ngc 1515 have the largest apparent magnitude of 12.9 follow by ngc 1705 with 12.8"

Data source consulted:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: dorado_group (columns: name text, type text, ra ( j2000 ) text, dec ( j2000 ) text, redshift (km / s ) text, apparent magnitude double precision)

Evidence collected:
1) Top apparent magnitudes (descending) to identify the largest values
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" DESC LIMIT 10;
- Result (top entries):
  1. ngc 1796 – 12.9
  2. ngc 1705 – 12.8
  3. ngc 2082 – 12.6
  4. ngc 1688 – 12.6
  5. ic 2056 – 12.5
  6. ngc 1596 – 12.1
  7. ngc 1515 – 12.1
  8. ngc 1546 – 11.8
  9. ngc 1533 – 11.7
  10. ngc 1947 – 11.7

2) Apparent magnitudes for the two galaxies named in the claim
- SQL executed (ngc 1515):
  SELECT "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 1515';
- Result: 12.1
- SQL executed (ngc 1705):
  SELECT "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 1705';
- Result: 12.8

3) Identify which galaxy actually has the maximum apparent magnitude
- SQL executed (max value):
  SELECT MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_apparent_magnitude FROM public.dorado_group;
- Result: 12.9
- SQL executed (who has 12.9):
  SELECT name, "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE "apparent magnitude" = 12.9;
- Result: ngc 1796 – 12.9

4) Check the top distinct apparent magnitude tiers
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" DESC LIMIT 3;
  SELECT name, "apparent magnitude" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE "apparent magnitude" IN (12.9, 12.8, 12.6);
- Results:
  - 12.9: ngc 1796
  - 12.8: ngc 1705
  - 12.6: ngc 2082, ngc 1688

Findings:
- The largest apparent magnitude in the dataset is 12.9, held by ngc 1796, not ngc 1515.
- ngc 1705 has an apparent magnitude of 12.8, which is the next lower distinct value after 12.9.
- ngc 1515 has an apparent magnitude of 12.1 and is not the largest; it ranks below several others.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data: ngc 1515 does not have the largest apparent magnitude (12.9). The largest is ngc 1796 at 12.9; ngc 1705 at 12.8 follows after that. ngc 1515 is 12.1.

Assumptions made:
- “Largest apparent magnitude” was interpreted numerically within the public.dorado_group table of the TabFact database.
- Galaxy names were matched exactly as stored (lowercase) in the table.
