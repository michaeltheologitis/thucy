Data source explored: A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table public.chicagoland_speedway containing columns: record, date, driver, time, speed / avg speed.

Evidence gathered:
1) Query to list all qualifying-related entries
- Executed SQL:
SELECT record, date, driver, time, "speed / avg speed" 
FROM public.chicagoland_speedway 
WHERE record ILIKE '%qualifying%';

- Result summary (relevant rows):
  - Record: qualifying | Date: September 6, 2003 | Driver: Richie Hearn | Time: 24.521 | Speed / Avg Speed: -
  - Record: qualifying | Date: September 14, 2013 | Driver: Joey Logano | Time: 28.509 | Speed / Avg Speed: -
  - Record: qualifying | Date: July 8, 2005 | Driver: Ryan Newman | Time: 28.964 | Speed / Avg Speed: -
  - Record: qualifying | Date: July 21, 2012 | Driver: Justin Lofton | Time: 31.007 | Speed / Avg Speed: -

2) Direct lookup for time 24.521
- Executed SQL:
SELECT record, date, driver, time, "speed / avg speed" 
FROM public.chicagoland_speedway 
WHERE time = '24.521'

- Result:
  - Record: qualifying | Date: September 6, 2003 | Driver: Richie Hearn | Time: 24.521 | Speed / Avg Speed: -

Assessment:
- The database contains a qualifying record entry with time 24.521, set by Richie Hearn on September 6, 2003 at Chicagoland Speedway. Therefore, the statement that the qualifying record time is 24.521 is supported by the data. Note that the table also includes other qualifying records for different dates/series (e.g., NASCAR, ARCA), but the 24.521 entry exists and corresponds to a qualifying record.

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to the qualifying record as represented in the provided Chicagoland Speedway dataset (not to a specific series unless otherwise implied by the data).
