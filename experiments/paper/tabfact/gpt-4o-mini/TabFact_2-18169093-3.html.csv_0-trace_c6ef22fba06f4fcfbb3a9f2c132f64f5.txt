Summary
- Claim: “In the 1981 Open Championship no player finished under par.”
- Finding from available data: In the dataset we have for the 1981 Open Championship (table: public.t_1981_open_championship), no recorded score is under par; all “to par” values are either even or over par. The data appears to represent a single round (scores range from 70 to 72), not final tournament totals. Thus, the claim is supported for the round covered by the dataset, but we cannot verify the final tournament outcome from this data alone.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources and schema:
  - public schema
  - Table: t_1981_open_championship (columns: place [text], player [text], country [text], score [bigint], "to par" [text])
  - No other related tables were found in the public schema.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any under-par results (negative “to par”)
- Purpose: Determine whether any entries show a negative “to par” (i.e., under par).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS under_par_count FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE "to par" LIKE '-%';
- Result: under_par_count = 0

- Executed SQL (to list any such rows):
  SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE "to par" LIKE '-%';
- Result: 0 rows (no players under par)

2) Inspect score range and “to par” values
- Purpose: Understand whether the dataset likely represents a single round and confirm there are no negative “to par” values.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(score) AS min_score, MAX(score) AS max_score FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: min_score = 70, max_score = 72

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship;
- Result: distinct values = { 'e' (even), '+ 1', '+ 2' }

Interpretation
- The dataset shows only even or over-par results, with scores ranging from 70 to 72 and no negative “to par” entries. This strongly suggests the table captures a single round of scoring (not the final 72-hole totals). Within this dataset’s scope, no player is under par.
- Because no final-tournament totals are present, we cannot verify whether “no player finished under par” applies to the entire championship based solely on this database. The evidence strictly supports that, in the recorded round represented by this table, no player finished under par.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data, the statement is supported for the round captured in the dataset. The database does not include final tournament totals, so we cannot confirm or deny the claim for the overall championship outcome.

Assumptions
- “Finish” is interpreted as the completion of the round represented in the available dataset (public.t_1981_open_championship), since final totals are not available.
- The “e” value in “to par” denotes even par.
- The table contains official scoring for at least one round of the 1981 Open Championship.
