Claim interpreted: “Detroit have the highest home team score, at 6 points.” Interpreted within the available data (the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season table), this means: among all games listed in the season table (including games where other teams were the home team), the maximum goals scored by any home team is 6, and that top home score belongs to Detroit.

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Schema sanity check (sample rows):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season LIMIT 10;
Key observation: The score values appear in the format “visitor_score - home_score.” For example, with visitor = nashville, home = detroit, score = “0 - 6”, Detroit (home) scored 6.

Evidence 1: Compute the maximum home score across the full table
SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(BTRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)) AS INT)) AS max_home_score FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
Result: max_home_score = 6

Evidence 2: List all games where the home score equals the maximum
SQL:
SELECT date, home, visitor, score
   FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
   WHERE CAST(BTRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)) AS INT) = (
       SELECT MAX(CAST(BTRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2)) AS INT)) FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
   )
   ORDER BY date;
Result:
- Date: January 5; Home: detroit; Visitor: nashville; Score: 0 - 6

Evidence 3: Confirm there are no home scores ≥ 6 other than the above
SQL:
SELECT date, home, visitor, score, CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INTEGER) AS home_score
FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season
WHERE CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INTEGER) >= 6
ORDER BY home_score DESC, date;
Result:
- Only one such game: January 5; detroit vs nashville; 0 - 6 (home_score = 6)

Conclusion: The highest home team score in the dataset is 6, and it was achieved by Detroit. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the available dataset (2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season) rather than all NHL seasons.
- The score field is interpreted as “visitor_score - home_score.”
- “Points” refers to goals scored in an NHL game (i.e., the home team’s goals).
