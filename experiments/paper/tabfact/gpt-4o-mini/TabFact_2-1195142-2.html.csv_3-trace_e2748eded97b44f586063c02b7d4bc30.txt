Claim to verify: "jerry mitchell be 1 of 3 nominee for a drama desk award"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: la_cage_aux_folles_musical(year bigint, award text, category text, nominee text, result text)

Evidence gathered
1) Identify all Drama Desk Award entries in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result 
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical 
WHERE LOWER(award) LIKE '%drama desk%';
- Result (summarized): 3 rows, all from 2005:
  • 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding revival of a musical | outstanding revival of a musical | won
  • 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding choreography | jerry mitchell | won
  • 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding costume design | william ivey long | nominated

2) Confirm Jerry Mitchell’s Drama Desk entry
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result 
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical 
WHERE lower(award) LIKE '%drama desk%' 
AND lower(nominee) LIKE '%jerry mitchell%';
- Result: 2005 | Drama Desk Award | Outstanding Choreography | Jerry Mitchell | Won

3) Count Drama Desk Award entries for 2005 within this dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as count, year, award, category, nominee, result 
FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical 
WHERE year = 2005 AND award ILIKE '%drama desk%' 
GROUP BY year, award, category, nominee, result;
- Result (summarized): 3 rows matching 2005 Drama Desk Award entries (as listed in step 1)

Analysis
- The dataset contains three Drama Desk Award entries for 2005 related to the production La Cage aux Folles, one of which is Jerry Mitchell (Outstanding Choreography), who is listed as the winner.
- Therefore, within this dataset, Jerry Mitchell is indeed one of three Drama Desk Award-related nominees/entries associated with La Cage aux Folles in 2005.
- The statement could also be interpreted as “one of three nominees in his category (Outstanding Choreography) overall.” The available data does not list all nominees across all productions, so we cannot verify the total number of nominees in the category.

Conclusion
- Based on the data available, Jerry Mitchell is one of three Drama Desk Award entries recorded for La Cage aux Folles in 2005; he won Outstanding Choreography. This supports the claim under the interpretation that the “three nominees” pertain to this production’s Drama Desk Award entries in that year.

Assumptions and scope
- Assumption: The claim refers to Drama Desk Award entries associated with La Cage aux Folles (the scope of the available dataset), not the total number of nominees across all productions in the category.
- Limitation: The dataset does not enumerate nominees from other productions, so we cannot confirm if his category had exactly three nominees overall.
