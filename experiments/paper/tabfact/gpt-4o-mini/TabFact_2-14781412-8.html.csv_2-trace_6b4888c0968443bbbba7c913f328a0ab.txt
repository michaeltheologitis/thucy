Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “Nadia Al-Moutawaa [is] the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games.”
- Finding: Supported by data. The earliest year in the dataset is 1982 and the gold medalist that year is Nadia Al‑Moutawaa, making her the first equestrian gold medalist in the recorded Asian Games data.

Assumptions
- The table equestrian_at_the_asian_games is a complete record of equestrian gold medalists starting from the first year equestrian was contested at the Asian Games. No earlier equestrian events than 1982 are present in this dataset.
- Minor variations in hyphenation/spelling (e.g., “Al - Moutawaa” vs “Al-Moutawaa”) refer to the same person.
