Claim interpreted: The user implies that at DREAM 11, in “his” (assumed Joachim Hansen’s) fight with Shinya Aoki, the key moment/finish is at 4:56.

Evidence from data:
- The database contains a table of Joachim Hansen’s fight records (public.joachim_hansen_fighter) with columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.
- Querying for rows involving Shinya Aoki and/or DREAM events returns a row showing that at dream 11, Hansen lost to Shinya Aoki by submission (armbar) at 4:56 of Round 2 in Yokohama, Japan.

Executed SQL (producing the supporting row):
SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time, location 
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%aoki%' OR event ILIKE '%dream%';

Relevant returned row (fields):
- res: loss
- opponent: shinya aoki
- method: submission (armbar)
- event: dream 11
- round: 2
- time: 4:56
- location: yokohama , japan

Conclusion:
- At DREAM 11, Joachim Hansen’s fight with Shinya Aoki ended at 4:56 of Round 2 by submission (armbar). If the instruction “go to 4:56” refers to the decisive moment in the fight video, this is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “his” refers to Joachim Hansen (based on the available dataset being Hansen’s fight record).
- “go to 4:56” refers to the official recorded time of the fight’s finish (Round 2, 4:56).
