Summary
- Finding: The girls’ singles winner Lindaweni Fanetri and the mixed doubles pair Wifqi Windarto & Debby Susanto occurred together in 2007 at the Indonesian National Badminton Championships. There are no records of this occurring after 2007.

Key Evidence (with executed SQL)
1) Full record for 2007 confirms both winners
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2007;

Result row:
- Year: 2007
- Boys Singles: Nandang Arif
- Girls Singles: Lindaweni Fanetri
- Boys Doubles: Budi Hartono & Yohanes Rendy Sugiarto
- Girls Doubles: Anneke Feinya Agustin & Wenny Setiawati
- Mixed Doubles: Wifqi Windarto & Debby Susanto

2) No year strictly after 2007 matches both conditions
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "girls singles", "mixed doubles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE year > 2007 
AND LOWER("girls singles") = 'lindaweni fanetri' 
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%wifqi windarto%' 
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%debby susanto%'
ORDER BY year;

Result: No records found.

3) Individually, no occurrences after 2007 for either condition
- Girls’ singles = Lindaweni Fanetri, year > 2007
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "girls singles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE year > 2007 AND LOWER("girls singles") = 'lindaweni fanetri' 
ORDER BY year;
Result: No records found.

- Mixed doubles contains both names, year > 2007
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "mixed doubles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE year > 2007 
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%wifqi windarto%'
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%debby susanto%'
ORDER BY year;
Result: No records found.

Clarification of the timeframe (>= 2007 vs. > 2007)
For completeness, checking year >= 2007 shows the match occurs in 2007, but not after:
- Girls’ singles in 2007+:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "girls singles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE year >= 2007 AND LOWER("girls singles") = 'lindaweni fanetri' 
ORDER BY year;
Result: 2007 — Lindaweni Fanetri

- Mixed doubles in 2007+:
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "mixed doubles" 
FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships 
WHERE year >= 2007 
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%wifqi windarto%'
AND LOWER("mixed doubles") LIKE '%debby susanto%'
ORDER BY year;
Result: 2007 — Wifqi Windarto & Debby Susanto

Conclusion
- The combination “girls’ singles winner = Lindaweni Fanetri” and “mixed doubles winners = Wifqi Windarto & Debby Susanto” occurred in 2007.
- There are no records of this occurring after 2007. Thus, if the claim asserts it happened after 2007, the data contradicts that.

Assumptions
- “girl single” is interpreted as the Girls’ Singles category in the Indonesian National Badminton Championships (junior event), and “mixed double” as the Mixed Doubles category in the same competition.
- “after the year 2007” is interpreted as year > 2007 (not including 2007).
