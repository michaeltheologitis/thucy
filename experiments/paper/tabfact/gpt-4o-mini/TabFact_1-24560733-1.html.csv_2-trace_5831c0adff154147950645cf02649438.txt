Summary: The claim that the Wildcats lost 1 game in September and 2 games in November is supported by the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football game log.

1) Data source exploration
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), wildcats points (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

2) Evidence from full season game log
SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents, record 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
ORDER BY game;
Result (relevant rows shown):
- Sept 20 vs Ole Miss — result: loss (7–14)
- Sept 27 vs Cincinnati — result: win (20–0)
- Nov 1 vs 18 Alabama — result: loss (0–13)
- Nov 8 vs West Virginia — result: win (15–6)
- Nov 15 vs Evansville — result: win (36–0)
- Nov 22 vs Tennessee — result: loss (6–13)
Interpretation: Losses appear on Sept 20 (1 loss in September) and on Nov 1 and Nov 22 (2 losses in November).

3) Direct counts by month (losses only)
- September losses
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses_sept 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE result = 'loss' AND date ILIKE 'sept%';
Result: losses_sept = 1

- November losses
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses_nov 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE result = 'loss' AND date ILIKE 'nov%';
Result: losses_nov = 2

Conclusion: The data shows exactly 1 loss in September and 2 losses in November for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team. The claim is supported.

Assumptions made:
- "the wildcat" refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team represented in the available 1947 dataset.
- Month identification is based on the date text prefix ('sept' for September, 'nov' for November) present in the table's date column.
