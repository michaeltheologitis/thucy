Claim interpreted: In 2009, the mixed doubles champions were Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu (Yayuh) Rahayu, and the boys’ singles champion was Hermansyah.

Findings:
- Mixed doubles (2009): Supported. The database lists the mixed doubles champions as “Didit Juang Indrianto Yayuh Rahayu.” This matches the claimed pair, with a minor spelling difference in the given first name (Yayu vs. Yayuh).
- Boys’ singles (2009): Not supported. The database lists “Riyanto Subagja,” not Hermansyah, as the boys’ singles champion for 2009. Additionally, no year in the dataset lists Hermansyah as boys’ singles champion.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve 2009 mixed doubles champions
SQL:
SELECT "mixed doubles" FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
Result: Didit Juang Indrianto Yayuh Rahayu

2) Retrieve 2009 boys’ singles champion
SQL:
SELECT "boys singles" FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
Result: Riyanto Subagja

3) Check if any year lists Hermansyah as boys’ singles champion
SQL:
SELECT year FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "boys singles" = 'Hermansyah';
Result: No rows returned

Conclusion: The mixed doubles portion of the claim is correct (minor name spelling difference), but the statement that Hermansyah was the boys’ singles champion in 2009 is contradicted by the data, which shows Riyanto Subagja.

Assumptions:
- “Mixed double” refers to the mixed doubles event in the Indonesian National Badminton Championships.
- “Boy single” refers to the boys’ singles event in the same championships.
- The year referenced is 2009 within this dataset.
