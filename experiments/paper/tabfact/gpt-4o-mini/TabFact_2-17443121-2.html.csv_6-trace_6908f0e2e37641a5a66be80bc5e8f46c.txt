Claim to verify: “The final episode has the second least view and aired May 6.”

Summary of findings based on the gary_unmarried dataset:
- The final (most recent) episode by air date is “Gary Fixes Allison’s Garbage Disposal,” which aired on May 20, 2009, not May 6.
- That final episode has the lowest (rank 1) viewership, not the second lowest.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the final episode by properly parsing air dates
SQL:
SELECT episode, to_date("air date", 'Month DD, YYYY') AS parsed_air_date, "air date" AS original_air_date, viewers 
FROM public.gary_unmarried 
ORDER BY parsed_air_date DESC 
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- Episode: Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal
- Original Air Date: May 20, 2009
- Parsed Air Date: 2009-05-20
- Viewers: 5.55 million

2) Confirm the final episode’s rank by viewers (1 = lowest)
SQL:
WITH ranked_episodes AS (
    SELECT 
        episode, 
        to_date("air date", 'Month DD, YYYY') AS parsed_air_date,
        viewers, 
        RANK() OVER (ORDER BY viewers) AS viewer_rank
    FROM 
        gary_unmarried
),
last_episode AS (
    SELECT 
        episode, 
        parsed_air_date, 
        viewers, 
        viewer_rank
    FROM 
        ranked_episodes
    ORDER BY 
        parsed_air_date DESC
    LIMIT 1
)
SELECT 
    episode, 
    parsed_air_date, 
    viewers, 
    viewer_rank
FROM 
    last_episode;
Result:
- Episode: gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal
- Air Date: 2009-05-20
- Viewers: 5.55 million
- Viewer Rank: 1 (lowest among all episodes)

3) Show the most recent episodes to verify dates around May 6 and May 20
SQL:
SELECT episode, to_date("air date", 'Month DD, YYYY') AS parsed_air_date, viewers
FROM public.gary_unmarried
ORDER BY parsed_air_date DESC
LIMIT 5;
Result (most recent first):
- May 20, 2009 – Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal – 5.55 million
- May 6, 2009 – Gary and His Half Brother – 6.66 million
- April 8, 2009 – Gary and the Trophy – 7.30 million
- March 18, 2009 – Gary Hooks Up Allison – 7.57 million
- March 11, 2009 – Gary Uses His Veto – 7.71 million

4) Full ordering by viewers to identify the second-lowest episode
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date", viewers, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY viewers ASC) as rank 
FROM public.gary_unmarried 
ORDER BY viewers ASC;
Key rows:
- Rank 1 (lowest): May 20, 2009 – Gary Fixes Allison's Garbage Disposal – 5.55 million
- Rank 2 (second-lowest): November 5, 2008 – Gary Meets the Gang – 6.44 million
Interpretation: The final episode is rank 1 (lowest), not rank 2 (second-lowest).

Conclusion:
- “Aired May 6” is false; the final episode aired May 20, 2009.
- “Second least view” is false; the final episode had the lowest viewership.

Assumptions made:
- “Final episode” refers to the most recent episode by air date in the provided gary_unmarried dataset.
- “View” refers to the “viewers” metric (in millions) in the table.
- The date format in the air date column is parsed using to_date with pattern 'Month DD, YYYY'.
