Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: Among players in the DF (defender) position, Dave Sutton has the most league goals.
- Data scope: Huddersfield Town FC 1979–80 season (public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season).

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (Huddersfield Town FC 1979–80 season data).

Schema overview (relevant fields)
- name (text): player name
- position (text): player position
- "league goals" (bigint): league goals scored

Evidence
1) List DF players and their league goals
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%DF%';

Result (players with DF in position and their league goals):
- Jim Branagan — 0
- Malcolm Brown — 2
- Keith Hanvey — 2
- Bernard Purdie — 0
- Fred Robinson — 1
- Dave Sutton — 6
- Chris Topping — 0

2) Identify the top-scoring DF
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE position ILIKE '%DF%' ORDER BY "league goals" DESC LIMIT 1;

Result: Dave Sutton — 6

3) Confirm Dave Sutton’s DF status and goals
Executed SQL:
SELECT "league goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name = 'Dave Sutton' AND position ILIKE '%DF%';

Result: 6

Conclusion
- Dave Sutton has 6 league goals, the highest among players with DF in their position in this dataset. The next highest DF league goal tallies are 2 (Malcolm Brown, Keith Hanvey).

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions
- The claim refers specifically to the Huddersfield Town FC 1979–80 season dataset and interprets “DF position” as any player whose position contains the substring 'DF'.
