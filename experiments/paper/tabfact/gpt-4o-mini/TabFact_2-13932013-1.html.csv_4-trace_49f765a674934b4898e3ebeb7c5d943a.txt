Claim to verify: "otto graham have win 44 more game than he lose"

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks (columns: quarterback, uniform no (s), games started, wins, losses, ties, winning pct)

Evidence retrieved:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT quarterback, wins, losses, ties, (wins - losses) AS win_diff FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%Graham%';

- Result:
  quarterback: Otto Graham; wins: 57; losses: 13; ties: 1; win_diff: 44

Assessment:
- The data shows Otto Graham has 57 wins and 13 losses as a Cleveland Browns starting quarterback in this dataset, yielding a wins-minus-losses differential of 44. This directly supports the claim as stated.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the queried data.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- The dataset reflects Cleveland Browns starting quarterback records. The figures align with Otto Graham’s NFL regular-season record with the Browns (1950–1955). Browns’ AAFC seasons (1946–1949) are not reflected here; including them would change the overall differential. The claim is interpreted in the scope of the provided dataset (Browns NFL record).
