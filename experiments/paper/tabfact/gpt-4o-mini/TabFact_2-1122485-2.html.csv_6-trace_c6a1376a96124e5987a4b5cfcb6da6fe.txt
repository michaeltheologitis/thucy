Claim interpreted: “Suspension trouble is the most common issue affecting results (retirements).” I verify this against the available data table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.

Data source discovery and structure
- Data sources: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (identified via data source discovery).
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint).

Evidence
1) Distinct values in time / retired with counts (to see overall distribution)
SQL executed:
SELECT "time / retired", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY "time / retired"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result excerpt (all values, with counts):
- engine: 4
- + 2 laps: 4
- + 1 lap: 4
- overheating: 2
- 1:47:35.5: 1
- + 4 laps: 1
- + 31.4: 1
- + 1:09.4: 1
- differential: 1
- accident: 1
- suspension: 1
- + 20.9: 1
- fuel leak: 1
- gearbox: 1
- physical: 1
Interpretation: values like a time (e.g., 1:47:35.5) or + … laps/seconds indicate finishers; textual terms (engine, suspension, etc.) indicate retirement reasons.

2) Retirement reasons only (filtering out finish times and gap markers)
SQL executed:
SELECT LOWER("time / retired") AS reason, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE "time / retired" NOT LIKE '+%'
  AND "time / retired" NOT LIKE '%:%'
  AND LOWER("time / retired") NOT LIKE '%lap%'
GROUP BY LOWER("time / retired")
ORDER BY count DESC;
Results:
- engine: 4
- overheating: 2
- fuel leak: 1
- gearbox: 1
- physical: 1
- accident: 1
- suspension: 1
- differential: 1
Finding: “engine” is the most common retirement cause (4). “suspension” appears once.

3) Who retired with suspension vs. engine
Suspension
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE LOWER("time / retired") = 'suspension';
Result:
- Driver: Jo Bonnier; Constructor: McLaren - Ford

Engine
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE LOWER("time / retired") = 'engine';
Results:
- Emerson Fittipaldi — Lotus - Ford
- Dave Charlton — Brabham - Ford
- Jackie Pretorius — Brabham - Ford
- Alex Soler - Roig — March - Ford

Conclusion
Based on the race dataset, suspension is not the most common issue; engine failures are the leading retirement cause. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- The user’s phrase “issue affect time suspension trouble be the most common” refers to retirement causes in the race results, specifically asserting “suspension” is the most common cause.
- The column time / retired encodes either finishing time/gap for classified finishers or a textual retirement reason for non-finishers, which is standard for such datasets.
