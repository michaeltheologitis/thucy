Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (public schema), which contains game logs for the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season.

Schema details consulted:
- Table: t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season
  - date (text): game date

  - score (text): game score
  - loss (text): indicates loss (if applicable)
  - attendance (bigint): spectators
  - record (text): cumulative win-loss record after the game

Evidence query and results:
1) Query to find games vs the Red Sox and the cumulative record after each:
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Red Sox%';

Result (relevant rows):
- Date: September 26, Opponent: Red Sox, Score: 3 - 0, Record: 74 - 86
- Date: September 27, Opponent: Red Sox, Score: 12 - 5, Record: 75 - 86
- Date: September 28, Opponent: Red Sox, Score: 3 - 2, Record: 76 - 86

Analysis:
- The row for September 28 vs Red Sox shows a score of 3 - 2 and a cumulative record of 76 - 86 following that game. This directly supports the claim that after the September 28 win against the Red Sox, the record was 76 - 86.

Conclusion:
- The data confirms the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “The record” refers to the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays’ cumulative season record, as this is the authoritative dataset available. The phrasing “win against the Red Sox” is interpreted via the cumulative record progression (74-86 to 75-86 to 76-86) indicating wins on Sept 26–28 vs Boston.
