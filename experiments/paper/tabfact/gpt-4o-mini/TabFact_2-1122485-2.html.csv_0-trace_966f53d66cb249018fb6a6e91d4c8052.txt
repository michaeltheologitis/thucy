Claim interpreted: “There be more Ford than any other, with Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least.” I interpret this as a statement about engine/manufacturer prevalence within the available 1971 South African Grand Prix dataset, counting how many entries are powered by each engine (e.g., Ford, BRM, Ferrari, Alfa Romeo, Matra).

Data discovery and schema
- Confirm available tables in the public schema:
  SQL:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

- Confirm table schema for public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix:
  SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1971_south_african_grand_prix';

  Reported columns:
  - laps (bigint)
  - grid (bigint)
  - driver (text)
  - constructor (text)
  - time / retired (text)

Evidence 1: Constructor counts (raw, as listed in the table)
- Purpose: See how entries are labeled and their frequencies.
- SQL:
  SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS count 
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
  GROUP BY constructor 
  ORDER BY count DESC, constructor;

- Result (constructor → count):
  - march - ford: 4
  - brabham - ford: 3
  - brm: 3
  - ferrari: 3
  - mclaren - ford: 3
  - surtees - ford: 3
  - lotus - ford: 2
  - tyrrell - ford: 2
  - march - alfa romeo: 1
  - matra: 1

Evidence 2: Engine/manufacturer counts (normalized from constructor)
- Method: If constructor contains “ - ”, take the text after the hyphen as the engine; otherwise, use the constructor as the engine. Lowercased for grouping.
- SQL (as executed):
  SELECT 
      LOWER(CASE 
          WHEN constructor LIKE '% - %' THEN SUBSTRING(constructor FROM POSITION(' - ' IN constructor) + 3) 
          ELSE constructor 
      END) AS engine,
      COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  GROUP BY engine
  ORDER BY count DESC, engine;

- Result (engine → count):
  - ford: 17
  - brm: 3
  - ferrari: 3
  - alfa romeo: 1
  - matra: 1

Assessment of the claim
- “more Ford than any other”: Supported. Ford has 17 entries, more than BRM (3), Ferrari (3), Alfa Romeo (1), and Matra (1).
- “Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the least”: Supported. Both have 1 entry each, the lowest count.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the dataset and the executed SQL queries above.

Assumptions
- The phrase “Ford,” “Alfa Romeo,” and “Matra” refer to engine/manufacturer as derived from the constructor field, where entries formatted like “team - engine” denote the engine after the hyphen, and single-word constructors (e.g., BRM, Ferrari, Matra) denote teams using their own engines.
- The verification is scoped to the available 1971 South African Grand Prix dataset (public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix).
