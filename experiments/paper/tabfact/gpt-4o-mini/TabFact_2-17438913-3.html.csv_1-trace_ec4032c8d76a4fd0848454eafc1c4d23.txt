Data source discovery
- Available data: public PostgreSQL database with a single table t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (Rangers FC 2008–2009 season). Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text).

What I checked
- Whether “SCO” has the highest number of transfers and whether its count (22) exceeds the combined count of all others.

Evidence from executed queries
1) Total number of rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season;
Result: 33

2) Breakdown by nationality (nat) and counts
SQL:
SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Result (top to bottom):
- SCO: 22
- ENG: 2
- BEL: 2
- ESP: 1
- RSA: 1
- FRA: 1
- GABON: 1
- IVORY COAST: 1
- SLOVAKIA: 1
- CYP: 1

3) Count where nationality is SCO (case-insensitive, trimmed)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as sco_count
FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
WHERE UPPER(TRIM(nat)) = 'SCO';
Result: 22

4) Sum of counts for all nationalities other than SCO
SQL:
SELECT SUM(count) as non_sco_count_sum
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as count
      FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
      WHERE UPPER(TRIM(nat)) <> 'SCO'
      GROUP BY nat) as subquery;
Result: 11

Findings
- “SCO” has 22 transfers in this dataset, which is the highest among all nat values.
- The combined total of all other nationalities is 11, which is less than 22.

Conclusion
- The claim that “sco have the highest amount of transfer at 22, more than every other team combine” is supported by the data in the available table, interpreting “sco” as the nationality code SCO and “team” as referring to nationalities in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “sco” refers to the nationality code in the nat column, not a club or league.
- “transfer amount” refers to the count of transfer records (rows) in this table for each nat, within the 2008–2009 Rangers FC dataset only.
