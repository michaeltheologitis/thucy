Scope and data sources
- Verified against the available database: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix (1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset).

Evidence
1) Check for entries where entrant is Private and driver is either Harry Schell or Johnny Claes
- Result: 0 matching rows.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE lower(entrant) LIKE 'private%' AND driver IN ('Harry Schell','Johnny Claes');

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE lower(entrant) LIKE 'private%' AND driver IN ('Harry Schell','Johnny Claes');

2) Inspect all drivers and entrants in the table
- Observation: The entrant value 'private' appears for Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin; Harry Schell is listed with 'ecurie bleue' and Johnny Claes with 'ecurie belge'.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT driver, entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix;

3) Confirm the number of 'private' entrants and list the corresponding drivers
- Result: Exactly 2 rows where entrant = 'private' (case-insensitive), for drivers Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
WHERE LOWER(entrant) = 'private';

SELECT driver
FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix
WHERE LOWER(entrant) = 'private';

Conclusion
- The table shows two occurrences of the entrant being 'private', but they are for Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin—not for Harry Schell or Johnny Claes. Therefore, the claim that the entrant was private on two occasions with drivers Harry Schell and Johnny Claes is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (1950 Swiss Grand Prix). Matching on entrant 'private' was performed case-insensitively.
