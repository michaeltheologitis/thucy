Claim: “the term start for ylli bufi be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a relevant table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania.
- Verified table schema contains columns: name (text), born - died (text), term start (text), term end (text), political party (text).

Schema evidence
- Table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
  Columns: name (text), born - died (text), term start (text), term end (text), political party (text)

Evidence queries and results
1) Purpose: Confirm both names exist in the table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name" FROM public."list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania";
Result (excerpt): includes 'ylli bufi' and 'vilson ahmeti'.

2) Purpose: Retrieve term start and end for both individuals.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "name", "term start", "term end" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" IN ('ylli bufi', 'vilson ahmeti');
Results:
- ylli bufi — Term Start: 5 June 1991; Term End: 10 December 1991
- vilson ahmeti — Term Start: 10 December 1991; Term End: 13 April 1992

Analysis
- Ylli Bufi’s term start (5 June 1991) is before Vilson Ahmeti’s term start (10 December 1991).
- Therefore, the claim that Ylli Bufi’s term start is after Vilson Ahmeti’s is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the office listed in the table (Prime Ministers of Albania) and compares the “term start” dates as presented in the dataset.
- Name matching is case-insensitive; entries are stored in lowercase in the dataset.
