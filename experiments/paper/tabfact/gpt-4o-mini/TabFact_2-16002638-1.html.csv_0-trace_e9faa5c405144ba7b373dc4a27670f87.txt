Claim to verify: “the hurricane win 90% of their game in 2007 which get them promote to a higher division.”

Data source explored
- Discovered database: dundee_hurricanes (public schema)
- Table: public.dundee_hurricanes(season bigint, division text, wins bigint, losses bigint, ties bigint, "final position" text, notes text)

1) Did they win 90% of their games in 2007?
Evidence query and result:
SQL:
SELECT wins, losses, ties, (wins + losses + ties) AS total_games, (CAST(wins AS DOUBLE PRECISION) / NULLIF((wins + losses + ties), 0)) AS win_pct
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
WHERE season = 2007;
Result:
- Wins: 9
- Losses: 1
- Ties: 0
- Total Games: 10
- Win Percentage: 0.9 (90%)
Assessment: Supported. 9 wins in 10 games is exactly 90%.

Additional season detail for 2007:
SQL:
SELECT division, wins, losses, ties, "final position", notes 
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE season = 2007;
Result:
- Division: BAFN Division 2 North
- Wins: 9, Losses: 1, Ties: 0
- Final Position: 1st out of 6
- Notes: Promoted to Division 1 North

2) Were they promoted to a higher division after 2007?
Evidence queries and result:
SQL:
SELECT season, division, notes FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season BETWEEN 2006 AND 2008 AND division IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- 2006: Division: bafl division 2 scottish, Notes: -
- 2007: Division: bafl division 2 north, Notes: promoted to division 1 north
- 2008: Division: bafl division 1 north, Notes: -
Assessment: Supported. The 2007 record explicitly notes promotion to Division 1 North, and the 2008 division reflects that promotion.

Conclusion
- The data shows the Dundee Hurricanes won 9 of 10 games in 2007 (90%) and were promoted from Division 2 North to Division 1 North for the following season. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- “the hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes (American football), the only “Hurricanes” entity present in the available database.
- “win 90% of their game” is interpreted as wins divided by total games (wins + losses + ties).
- “promote to a higher division” corresponds to moving from Division 2 North to Division 1 North as indicated in the notes and subsequent season’s division field.
