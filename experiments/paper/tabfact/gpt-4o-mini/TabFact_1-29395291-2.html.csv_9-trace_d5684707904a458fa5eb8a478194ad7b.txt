Claim to verify: “vodafone have 8704 subscriber (thousands) in 2006 with a 38 growth percentage.”

Data sources checked
- Database: public schema (authoritative mobile telephony in Africa dataset)
- Table: mobile_telephony_in_africa
  - Columns: provider (text), country (text), subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint), subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint), growth % (double precision)

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Locate Vodafone entries with 8,704k subscribers in 2006
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %" 
FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa 
WHERE provider ILIKE '%Vodafone%' 
  AND "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" = 8704;
Result:
- Provider: Vodafone; Country: Egypt; Subscribers (2006): 8704 (thousands); Growth %: 42

2) Verify 2005→2006 growth by recalculation
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2005) (thousands)", "subscribers (2006) (thousands)", "growth %",
  ROUND(("subscribers (2006) (thousands)" - "subscribers (2005) (thousands)")::numeric / NULLIF("subscribers (2005) (thousands)", 0) * 100, 1) AS calc_growth_pct
FROM mobile_telephony_in_africa
WHERE provider ILIKE '%Vodafone%'
  AND country ILIKE '%Egypt%';
Result:
- Provider: Vodafone; Country: Egypt; Subscribers (2005): 6125 (thousands); Subscribers (2006): 8704 (thousands); Growth % (recorded): 42; Calculated Growth %: 42.1%

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “8704 subscriber (thousands) in 2006”: Supported for Vodafone (Egypt) — exact match at 8,704k.
- “with a 38 growth percentage”: Not supported. The dataset records 42%, and independent calculation yields 42.1%.

Conclusion
- The subscriber figure is correct for Vodafone in Egypt (2006). The growth percentage is incorrect per the data, which shows approximately 42% growth, not 38%.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to Vodafone within the African market dataset, and specifically to the entry matching 8,704k subscribers in 2006, which corresponds to Vodafone Egypt. The claim did not specify a country; the dataset is country-specific, and this is the only Vodafone record matching 8,704k in 2006.
