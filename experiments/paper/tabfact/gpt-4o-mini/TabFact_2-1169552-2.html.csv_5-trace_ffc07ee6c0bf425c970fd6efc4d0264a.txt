Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: “1872 - 1884 be the year for hercules.” Interpreted within the available Southern Railway locomotives dataset as a statement about the Hercules locomotive class’s relevant year range (most plausibly the withdrawal years).

Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway.
- Schema (key columns): class (text), wheel arrangement (text), manufacturer (text), year made (text), quantity made (text), quantity preserved (text), year (s) withdrawn (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find any entries mentioning “Hercules”
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE class ILIKE '%Hercules%' OR manufacturer ILIKE '%Hercules%';
Result (relevant row):
- Class: hercules
- Manufacturer: nine elms works
- Wheel Arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0
- Year Made: 1851 - 1854
- Quantity Made: 15
- Quantity Preserved: 0
- Year(s) Withdrawn: 1875 - 1884

2) Retrieve the exact row for class 'hercules'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE class = 'hercules';
Result confirms the same values as above, including Year(s) Withdrawn: 1875 - 1884.

3) Check for any occurrence of year 1872 in relevant fields
SQL (exact match):
SELECT class, "year made", "year (s) withdrawn" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE "year made" = '1872' OR "year (s) withdrawn" = '1872';
SQL (partial match):
SELECT class, "year made", "year (s) withdrawn" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE "year made" LIKE '%1872%' OR "year (s) withdrawn" LIKE '%1872%';
Results: No rows found containing 1872 in those fields.

Findings
- The dataset contains a Hercules locomotive class with Year(s) Withdrawn recorded as 1875 - 1884, not 1872 - 1884.
- The Year Made for this class is 1851 - 1854.
- No evidence in the dataset supports 1872 as part of the Hercules year range in either year made or year(s) withdrawn.

Conclusion
- The end year 1884 aligns with the recorded withdrawal end for the Hercules class, but the start year should be 1875 (not 1872). Therefore, the claim “1872 - 1884 be the year for hercules” is not supported as stated.

Assumptions
- “Hercules” refers to the locomotive class named hercules in the provided Southern Railway locomotives dataset.
- “1872 - 1884 be the year” refers to a year range relevant to that class, most plausibly the Year(s) Withdrawn field, since that is the closest matching range available in the data.
