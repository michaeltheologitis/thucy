Claim interpreted: The statement “there be a 5 MHz frequency change range” is taken to mean that the difference between the maximum and minimum frequencies recorded in the available dataset is 5.0 MHz.

Evidence from data:
1) Overall frequency range in public.whlp
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows, MIN("frequency mhz") as min_frequency_mhz, MAX("frequency mhz") as max_frequency_mhz, (MAX("frequency mhz") - MIN("frequency mhz")) as range_mhz FROM public.whlp;
Results:
- Total Rows: 6
- Minimum Frequency (MHz): 92.1
- Maximum Frequency (MHz): 106.5
- Range (MHz): 14.4

2) Frequencies present (for transparency)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM public.whlp ORDER BY "frequency mhz" ASC;
Results (ordered ascending):
- w221by — 92.1 MHz
- w223au — 92.5 MHz
- w240bj — 95.9 MHz
- w264bf — 100.7 MHz
- w276bm — 103.1 MHz
- w293al — 106.5 MHz

Assessment:
- The computed frequency range across the dataset is 14.4 MHz, not 5 MHz. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- Because the request was ambiguous, I interpreted “5 MHz frequency change range” as the spread (max − min) of the “frequency mhz” values in the only available table (public.whlp). If instead the claim was about a specific station’s historical frequency change or another subset, such information is not present in the provided dataset.
