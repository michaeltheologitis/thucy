Claim to verify: “4 of the team have a minus goal difference while only 4 have score more goal than those against them.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
- Columns: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), played (bigint), against (bigint), difference (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Teams and their goal differences
- SQL executed: SELECT team, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football;
- Result:
  - Flamengo — 8
  - Fluminense — 10
  - Corinthians — 4
  - Palestra Itália — 3
  - Portuguesa — -10
  - Botafogo — 0
  - Vasco da Gama — -2
  - América — -10
  - São Paulo — -13

2) Count of teams with negative goal difference (minus GD)
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS negative_goal_difference_count FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE difference < '0';
- Result: 4

3) Count of teams with positive goal difference (scored more than conceded)
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS positive_goal_difference_count FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE difference > '0';
- Result: 4

4) Count of teams with zero goal difference (for completeness)
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_count FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE difference = '0';
- Result: 1

5) Total number of teams (sanity check)
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_teams FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football;
- Result: 9

6) Teams with positive goal difference (cross-check)
- SQL executed: SELECT team, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE difference::int > 0;
- Result:
  - Flamengo — 8
  - Fluminense — 10
  - Corinthians — 4
  - Palestra Itália — 3

Assessment
- The data show 4 teams with a negative goal difference and 4 teams with a positive goal difference, matching the claim exactly. One team has a zero goal difference, making the totals consistent (4 negative + 4 positive + 1 zero = 9 teams).

Assumptions
- “Minus goal difference” is interpreted as a negative value in the “difference” column.
- “Score more goal than those against them” is interpreted as having a positive goal difference.
- The claim refers to the teams present in the table public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football (1940 Brazilian football dataset).
