Summary conclusion
- The New York Jets played the Miami Dolphins twice in the 1993 season: Week 2 (away) and Week 10 (home). Attendance was 70,314 in the first meeting and 71,306 in the second. The second game had 992 more attendees than the first, matching the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Table: public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season (columns: week BIGINT, date TEXT, opponent TEXT, result TEXT, game site TEXT, attendance BIGINT)

Schema details used
- Columns relevant to this check: week, date, opponent, game site, attendance

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve both Dolphins games with details
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance 
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
WHERE opponent IN ('miami dolphins', 'Dolphins') 
ORDER BY week ASC;
Result:
- Week 2 | September 12, 1993 | Miami Dolphins | Joe Robbie Stadium | Attendance: 70,314
- Week 10 | November 7, 1993 | Miami Dolphins | The Meadowlands | Attendance: 71,306

2) Cross-check games and attendance using case-insensitive match
SQL:
SELECT week, attendance 
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Miami Dolphins';
Result:
- Week 2 | Attendance: 70,314
- Week 10 | Attendance: 71,306

Computation
- Difference (second minus first) = 71,306 − 70,314 = 992
- The second meeting (Week 10) had higher attendance than the first (Week 2) by 992.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “First game” and “second game” refer to the two regular-season meetings ordered by week within the 1993 season (Week 2 first, Week 10 second).
