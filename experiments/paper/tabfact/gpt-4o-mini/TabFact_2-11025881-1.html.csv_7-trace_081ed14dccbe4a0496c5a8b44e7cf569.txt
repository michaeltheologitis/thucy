Claim assessed: “pierre lamine beat shinji someya by more than a point.”

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships (1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships).

Schema details (via schema tool)
- Table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  - Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), sp + fs (bigint), points (double precision), places (double precision)

Evidence
1) Locate the two skaters and their results
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, nation, rank, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Pierre%' OR name ILIKE '%Lamine%' ORDER BY rank ASC;
  Result:
  - Name: Pierre Lamine | Nation: France | Rank: 8 | Points: 150.5

- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, nation, rank, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Shinji%' OR name ILIKE '%Someya%' ORDER BY rank ASC;
  Result:
  - Name: Shinji Someya | Nation: Japan | Rank: 9 | Points: 150.34

2) Compute the points margin
- SQL executed:
  WITH skater1 AS (
      SELECT name, points 
      FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
      WHERE name ILIKE '%Pierre%' OR name ILIKE '%Lamine%'
      LIMIT 1
  ), skater2 AS (
      SELECT name, points 
      FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
      WHERE name ILIKE '%Shinji%' OR name ILIKE '%Someya%'
      LIMIT 1
  )
  SELECT skater1.name AS name1, skater1.points AS points1, 
         skater2.name AS name2, skater2.points AS points2, 
         ROUND((skater1.points - skater2.points)::numeric, 2) AS points_difference 
  FROM skater1, skater2;
  Result:
  - Name1: Pierre Lamine | Points1: 150.5
  - Name2: Shinji Someya | Points2: 150.34
  - Points difference: 0.16

Conclusion
- The data shows Pierre Lamine ranked ahead of Shinji Someya (8 vs 9), so Lamine did beat Someya.
- However, the margin was 0.16 points, which is not “more than a point.”

Final assessment: The claim that he beat him “by more than a point” is not supported by the data; the margin was less than one point.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “beat” as finishing with a better rank (lower numerical rank) in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships dataset (the only available authoritative source).
