Claim to verify: “Quentin is the only person to be a police officer in the Cube.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant asset: public.cube_film_series.
- Schema (public.cube_film_series): columns = name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text). This table represents characters from the Cube film series, including their occupations.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Identify all characters with police-related occupations
SQL:
SELECT name, occupation FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%';
Result:
- Quentin | Police Officer

2) Count unique characters with police-related occupation
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS unique_police_characters FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%';
Result:
- unique_police_characters = 1

3) Confirm Quentin appears among police-related occupations
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 AS is_quentin_present FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%' AND name ILIKE '%Quentin%';
Result:
- is_quentin_present = true

4) Broader check for law-enforcement synonyms (police, cop, detective)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT occupation FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%' OR occupation ILIKE '%cop%' OR occupation ILIKE '%detective%';
Result:
- Police Officer

SQL:
SELECT name, occupation FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE occupation ILIKE '%police%' OR occupation ILIKE '%cop%' OR occupation ILIKE '%detective%';
Result:
- Quentin | Police Officer

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one character with a law-enforcement occupation, and that character is Quentin. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “the cube” refers to the Cube film series represented by public.cube_film_series.
- “person” refers to a character in the series (as recorded in the table), not the actor.
- “police officer” is matched via case-insensitive search for police-related terms in the occupation field.
