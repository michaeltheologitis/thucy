Data source discovery

Executed SQL:
1) List all tables
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
2) Retrieve table descriptions (if any)
SELECT pg_namespace.nspname AS schema_name, pg_class.relname AS table_name, pg_description.description
FROM pg_description
JOIN pg_class ON pg_class.oid = pg_description.objoid
JOIN pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid = pg_class.relnamespace;

Table structure

- Columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text)
Executed SQL:
3) Describe columns
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 'media_in_kelowna' AND table_schema = 'public';
4) Check primary keys
SELECT a.attname AS column_name
FROM pg_catalog.pg_constraint c
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_class t ON c.conrelid = t.oid
JOIN pg_catalog.pg_attribute a ON a.attnum = ANY(c.conkey) AND a.attrelid = t.oid
WHERE c.contype = 'p' AND t.relname = 'media_in_kelowna' AND t.relnamespace = (SELECT oid FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace WHERE nspname = 'public');

Evidence queries

SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
Relevant row observed:
- Frequency: 1150 am | Call Sign: ckfr | Branding: am 1150 | Format: news / talk | Owner: astral media

B) Filter by owner = 'astral media'
SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner = 'astral media';
Result:

- Call sign case differences (ckfr vs. CKFR) are treated as formatting; call signs are conventionally uppercase.
