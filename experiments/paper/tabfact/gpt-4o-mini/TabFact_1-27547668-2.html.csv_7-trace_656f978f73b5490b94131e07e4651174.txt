Claim: There are 2 episodes in the series that were directed by Perry Chafe.

Data source explored: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (Republic of Doyle episodes)
- Relevant columns include: title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), viewers (bigint), original airdate (text), prod code (bigint)

Checks performed and evidence:
1) Count episodes exactly credited to Perry Chafe as director
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episodes_count FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" = 'Perry Chafe';
Result: 0

2) List titles exactly credited to Perry Chafe as director
Executed SQL:
SELECT title FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE "directed by" = 'Perry Chafe';
Result: 0 rows

3) Case-insensitive substring search for Perry Chafe in the director field (to catch multi-credit or formatting variations)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE LOWER('%perry chafe%');
Result: 0

4) Inspect distinct director credits to confirm the set of credited directors in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "directed by" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes;
Result (sampled all distinct values):
- Steve Dimarco
- Phil Earnshaw
- Steve Scaini
- Mike Clattenburg
- Larry McLean
- Robert Lieberman
- Jerry Ciccoritti
(No entries for Perry Chafe.)

Conclusion: The dataset shows zero episodes directed by Perry Chafe. Therefore, the claim that there are 2 such episodes is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “the series” refers to Republic of Doyle, which is the available authoritative dataset in the current data environment.
- “perry chafe” refers to the individual Perry Chafe, spelled as shown. A case-insensitive search and substring match were used to account for stylistic variations or multiple-credit entries.
