Claim interpreted: Provide three different baseball games where the final score was 8 - 1, based on the available data sources.

Data discovery and context
- Available database: TabFact
- Available table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season (game logs for the 2006 Texas Rangers season)
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to confirm score formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 10;

Observed: Scores are stored as text with spaces around the hyphen, e.g., "8 - 1". Example from the sample: september 4 vs athletics has score "8 - 1".

Step 2: Retrieve all games with final score exactly "8 - 1"
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '8 - 1';

Results (3 games):
1) Date: September 4; Opponent: Athletics; Score: 8 - 1; Loss: Zito
2) Date: September 17; Opponent: Angels; Score: 8 - 1; Loss: Santana
3) Date: September 18; Opponent: Mariners; Score: 8 - 1; Loss: Hernández

Conclusion
- The available data confirms three distinct games (within the 2006 Texas Rangers season logs) ended with a final score of 8 - 1. This directly satisfies the request for three different baseball games with that final score.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s message as a request to identify three examples of baseball games with a final score of 8 - 1 from the connected data source(s).
- Scope is limited to the available dataset (2006 Texas Rangers season). The claim was not interpreted as a universal statement about all baseball history, only a request for three examples.
- Match required the exact text format "8 - 1" (with spaces around the hyphen), consistent with this table’s formatting.
