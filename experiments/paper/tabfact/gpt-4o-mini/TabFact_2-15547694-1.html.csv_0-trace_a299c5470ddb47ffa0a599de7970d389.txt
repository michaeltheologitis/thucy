Summary
The available data source contains a table of the 5th Seanad (members_of_the_5th_seanad) showing seat counts per party across the various vocational panels and other categories, plus a “Total” row aggregating the entire chamber. The “Total” row shows that both the Agricultural Panel and the Labour Panel have 11 members in total. This supports the claim.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Initial aggregation (overcounts due to including the summary row)
- Purpose: Sum the Agricultural and Labour panel columns across all rows. This inadvertently double-counts because the table includes a summary row labeled “Total.”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM("agricultural panel") AS total_agricultural_panel, SUM("labour panel") AS total_labour_panel
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result returned by the tool: total_agricultural_panel = 21, total_labour_panel = 17
- Interpretation: These are inflated because they include the “Total” row which already represents the aggregate.

2) Direct inspection of table rows (shows the correct totals in the “Total” row)
- Purpose: View all rows to understand structure and read the aggregate values from the “Total” row.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT party, "administrative panel", "agricultural panel", "cultural and educational panel", "industrial and commercial panel", "labour panel", "national university of ireland", "university of dublin", "nominated by the taoiseach", total FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Returned rows (excerpt as provided by the tool):
  • Fianna Fáil: Agricultural Panel = 4, Labour Panel = 0, …
  • Fine Gael: Agricultural Panel = 3, Labour Panel = 0, …
  • Labour Party: Agricultural Panel = 0, Labour Panel = 5, …
  • Clann na Talmhan: Agricultural Panel = 2, Labour Panel = 1, …
  • Independent: Agricultural Panel = 1, Labour Panel = 0, …
  • Total: Agricultural Panel = 11, Labour Panel = 11, …, Total seats = 60
- Interpretation: The “Total” row explicitly lists 11 for both the Agricultural Panel and the Labour Panel, confirming the claim.

Conclusion
Based on the “Total” row in the 5th Seanad dataset, both the Agricultural Panel and the Labour Panel have 11 total members. This matches the commonly known allocation of vocational panel seats in Seanad Éireann and is directly supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Total members” is interpreted as the total number of seats assigned to each panel in the Seanad (not party-specific counts or another legislative term).
- Verification is performed against the 5th Seanad dataset available; the panel allocations are known to be consistent across Seanad compositions, but the confirmation here is specifically grounded in the provided 5th Seanad data.
