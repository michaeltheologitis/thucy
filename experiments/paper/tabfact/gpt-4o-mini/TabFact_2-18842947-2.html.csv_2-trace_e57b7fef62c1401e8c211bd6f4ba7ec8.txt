Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table identified: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve all Detroit Lions 1976 games vs Minnesota Vikings
SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'minnesota vikings';

Result:
- Week 3 | September 26, 1976 | Minnesota Vikings | L 10 - 9
- Week 9 | November 7, 1976   | Minnesota Vikings | L 31 - 23

2) Summarize count of games and outcomes vs Minnesota Vikings (1976)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count, SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'W%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins, SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'L%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'minnesota vikings';

Result:
- game_count: 2, wins: 0, losses: 2

Conclusion:
In the 1976 NFL season, the Detroit Lions played the Minnesota Vikings twice and lost both games (L 10-9 and L 31-23). Therefore, the Vikings defeated the Lions in both games they played that season.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1976 season (the scope of the available data). If a different season was intended, results could differ.
