Claim to verify
Olga Govortsova won at least one Grand Slam tournament match in each year from 2007 through 2011.

What I checked
- Whether in every year 2007–2011 there is at least one Grand Slam (Australian Open, French Open, Wimbledon, US Open) where her result indicates a second round or deeper (2r, 3r, etc.), which implies at least one main-draw match win. I also cross-checked yearly Grand Slam win–loss totals.

Evidence from data
1) Grand Slam results by year (four majors only)
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "2007", "2008", "2009", "2010", "2011" FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open');

Returned rows (summarized):
- australian open: 2007 a; 2008 1r; 2009 1r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r
- french open: 2007 a; 2008 3r; 2009 3r; 2010 2r; 2011 2r
- wimbledon: 2007 2r; 2008 1r; 2009 2r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r
- us open: 2007 2r; 2008 2r; 2009 1r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r

Interpretation per year:
- 2007: Wimbledon 2r, US Open 2r → at least one win (actually two slams with wins)
- 2008: French Open 3r, US Open 2r → at least one win
- 2009: French Open 3r, Wimbledon 2r → at least one win
- 2010: French Open 2r → at least one win
- 2011: French Open 2r → at least one win

2) Count of Grand Slams (among the four) with 2r-or-better each year
SQL executed and results:
- 2007
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_2007 FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') AND "2007" NOT IN ('1r', 'a')
  Result: 2
- 2008
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_2008 FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') AND "2008" NOT IN ('1r', 'a')
  Result: 2
- 2009
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_2009 FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') AND "2009" NOT IN ('1r', 'a')
  Result: 2
- 2010
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_2010 FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') AND "2010" NOT IN ('1r', 'a')
  Result: 1
- 2011
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_2011 FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') AND "2011" NOT IN ('1r', 'a')
  Result: 1

3) Yearly Grand Slam win–loss summary (corroboration)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.olga_govortsova WHERE tournament = 'win - loss';

Returned values:
- 2007: 2 - 2
- 2008: 3 - 4
- 2009: 3 - 4
- 2010: 1 - 4
- 2011: 1 - 4
This indicates at least one Grand Slam match win in each of the years 2007–2011.

Conclusion
The data show that in every year from 2007 through 2011, Olga Govortsova recorded at least one Grand Slam main-draw match win. Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- "win at least 1 grand slam tournament match" is interpreted as winning at least one main-draw match at any of the four Grand Slam tournaments in that year.
- Result codes: '1r' denotes a first-round loss (no wins), '2r' or deeper denotes at least one win, and 'a' denotes absence/did not participate.
