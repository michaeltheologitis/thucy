Claim to verify: “3 of West Berkshire Brewery’s beer each win a single award between 1995 and 2009.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema containing a single relevant table: west_berkshire_brewery.

Schema details (from inspection):
- Table: west_berkshire_brewery
  - Columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)
  - Each row represents an award a beer received in a given year/competition.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Beers with exactly one award between 1995 and 2009 (inclusive):
Executed SQL:
SELECT "beer name", COUNT(*) AS award_count
FROM west_berkshire_brewery
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
GROUP BY "beer name"
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

Result:
- dr hexter 's wedding ale — 1 award
- mash tun — 1 award
- old father thames — 1 award
- skiff — 1 award

2) Total number of beers with exactly one award in that period:
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_beers
FROM (
    SELECT "beer name"
    FROM west_berkshire_brewery
    WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009
    GROUP BY "beer name"
    HAVING COUNT(*) = 1
) AS single_award_beers;

Result:
- total_beers = 4

Assessment:
- The claim states that 3 West Berkshire Brewery beers each won a single award between 1995 and 2009. The data shows there are 4 such beers. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- “Win a single award between 1995 and 2009” is interpreted as: within the inclusive years 1995–2009, a beer appears exactly once (one award event) in the awards table, regardless of awards outside this period.
- Beer identity is determined by the text value in the "beer name" column, grouped case-sensitively as stored in the data.
