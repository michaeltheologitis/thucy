Summary of approach
- Discovered and inspected the only available data source, which contains match information for the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland.
- Queried the schema and the data to find any records involving Cambridge University and to understand what the "against" field represents.
- Assessed whether the data can verify the claim that “no team scored more than 10 against Cambridge University.”

Data sources discovered
- A single PostgreSQL table: t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland (tour matches; columns: opposing team, against, date, venue, status)

Schema evidence
Executed SQL:
- Query: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland';
- Result (summary): columns are [against bigint, opposing team text, date text, venue text, status text]. There is no column indicating points scored by New Zealand nor any direct record of scores conceded by Cambridge University across its matches (outside of the specific context of New Zealand’s tour).

Match data involving Cambridge University (within this dataset)
Executed SQL:
- Query: SELECT * FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE "opposing team" ILIKE '%Cambridge%';
- Result:
  - opposing team: cambridge university
  - against: 12
  - date: 18 October 1978
  - venue: Grange Road, Cambridge
  - status: tour match

Interpretation of available data
- In this dataset, “opposing team” refers to New Zealand’s opponent, and “against” is the number of points scored by that opponent (i.e., points conceded by New Zealand) during the 1978 tour. Thus, for the Cambridge University row, “against: 12” indicates Cambridge University scored 12 points against New Zealand on 18 Oct 1978.
- The dataset does not contain Cambridge University’s defensive record (i.e., how many points other teams scored against Cambridge University across Cambridge’s matches). It only shows what opponents scored against New Zealand.

Additional context (tour-wide, to clarify column semantics)
Executed SQL:
1) SELECT MAX(against) AS max_against FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland;
   - Result: 16
2) SELECT "opposing team", date FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland WHERE against > 10;
   - Result includes: Cambridge University (18 Oct 1978), London Counties (28 Oct 1978), Munster (31 Oct 1978), Wales (11 Nov 1978), Midland Counties (18 Nov 1978), Barbarians (16 Dec 1978)
- This confirms that “against” captures points scored by New Zealand’s opponent in those matches; it does not speak to points scored against Cambridge University in Cambridge’s own fixtures.

Conclusion
- The available dataset does not contain the information needed to verify the claim “no team scored more than 10 against Cambridge University.” It neither supports nor contradicts the claim, because it does not record points conceded by Cambridge University across its matches. It only records opponents’ points against New Zealand during the 1978 tour, including the single Cambridge University fixture where Cambridge University scored 12 against New Zealand.

Assumptions noted
- We assume the table exclusively covers New Zealand’s 1978 tour matches and that “against” denotes points scored by New Zealand’s opponent (points conceded by New Zealand). This interpretation is supported by the tour-wide queries above.
- We assume no additional data sources are available beyond this table, per the discovery step.
