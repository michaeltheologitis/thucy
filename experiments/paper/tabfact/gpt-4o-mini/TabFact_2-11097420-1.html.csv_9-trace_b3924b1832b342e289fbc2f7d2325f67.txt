Claim to verify: Construction was completed during the same time frame (1993) at the Flowood site and the Newsome Brothers site.

How I interpreted the claim: I treated “construct be complete” as the Superfund “construction completed” milestone and “newsome brother” as the Superfund site commonly recorded as “Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc.” “Same time frame of 1993” was interpreted as completion within calendar year 1993.

Data source overview: The available database contains one table: public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi with columns: cerclis id, name, county, proposed, listed, construction completed, partially deleted, deleted.

Evidence 1: Flowood site
- Result: Name: Flowood Site; County: Rankin; Construction Completed: 09/17/1993
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, county, "construction completed" 
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Flowood%';

Evidence 2: Newsome/Newsom Brothers site
- Result: Name: Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc; County: Marion; Construction Completed: August 8, 1997
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, county, "construction completed" 
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Newsom%' OR name ILIKE '%Newsome%' OR name ILIKE '%Brothers%' OR name ILIKE '%Bros%';

Assessment:
- The Flowood Site has a construction completed date in 1993 (09/17/1993).
- The Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc site has a construction completed date in 1997 (08/08/1997), not in 1993.
- Therefore, construction was not completed in the same time frame (1993) for both sites.

Assumptions made:
- “Construct be complete” refers to the “construction completed” field in the dataset.
- “newsome brother” refers to the “Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc” Superfund site.
- “Same time frame of 1993” means completion within calendar year 1993.
