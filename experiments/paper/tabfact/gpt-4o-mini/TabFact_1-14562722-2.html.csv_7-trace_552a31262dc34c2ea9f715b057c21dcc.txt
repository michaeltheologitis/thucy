Claim being checked: “the volume 's 2 , 4 , and 5 have 2 disc and 3 episode.” Interpreted as: Volumes 2, 4, and 5 each have exactly 2 discs and 3 episodes.

Data source discovery:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with one table: public.my_info_table
- Schema (from tool): columns = volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text). No keys or indexes.

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve discs and episodes for volumes 2, 4, and 5
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes FROM my_info_table WHERE volume IN (2, 4, 5);
Results reported by tool:
- Volume 2: discs = 1, episodes = 4
- Volume 4: discs = 1, episodes = 4
- Volume 5: discs = 1, episodes = 4

2) Check for duplicate rows per volume to ensure counts aren’t split across multiple rows
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM my_info_table WHERE volume IN (2, 4, 5) GROUP BY volume;
Results reported by tool:
- Volume 2: row_count = 1
- Volume 4: row_count = 1
- Volume 5: row_count = 1

Assessment:
- For volumes 2, 4, and 5, the data shows 1 disc and 4 episodes each, not 2 discs and 3 episodes. There is one row per volume, so there are no additional rows that might change the counts.

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “volume 's 2 , 4 , and 5” refers to the rows in public.my_info_table with volume values 2, 4, and 5.
- “have 2 disc and 3 episode” means exactly 2 discs and exactly 3 episodes per listed volume.
