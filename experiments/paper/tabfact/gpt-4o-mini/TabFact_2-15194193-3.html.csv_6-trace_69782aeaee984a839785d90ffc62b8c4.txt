Claim to verify: "all of alberto pagain's win be of the 500cc class, with an average point of 87"

Data source explored
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: alberto_pagani(year bigint, class text, team text, points bigint, wins bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Classes in which Alberto Pagani recorded wins
- Result: Only 500cc, total wins = 4
- SQL executed:
  SELECT class, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
  FROM alberto_pagani
  WHERE wins > 0
  GROUP BY class;

2) Per-year details for rows with wins > 0 (to confirm class of each win)
- Result (year, class, wins):
  - 1969, 500cc, 1
  - 1971, 500cc, 1
  - 1971, 500cc, 1
  - 1972, 500cc, 1
  All wins are in the 500cc class.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, class, wins FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY year;

3) Average points across all rows in the dataset
- Result: Average points ≈ 9.31; Seasons count (distinct years) = 14; Total points = 270
- SQL executed (seasons count):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS seasons_count FROM alberto_pagani;
- SQL executed (average across all rows):
  SELECT AVG(points) AS average_points FROM alberto_pagani;
- SQL executed (total points):
  SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points FROM alberto_pagani;

4) Average points per year (summing points across classes within each year, then averaging yearly totals)
- Yearly totals returned by SQL:
  - 1959: 2
  - 1960: 2
  - 1961: 3
  - 1962: 10
  - 1963: 9
  - 1964: 6
  - 1965: 1
  - 1966: 15
  - 1967: 11
  - 1968: 9
  - 1969: 15
  - 1970: 34
  - 1971: 62
  - 1972: 91
  Average of these yearly totals ≈ 19.29
- SQL executed (yearly totals):
  SELECT year, SUM(points) AS total_points FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY year ORDER BY year;
- SQL executed (average of yearly totals):
  SELECT AVG(total_points) AS average_points FROM (SELECT year, SUM(points) AS total_points FROM public.alberto_pagani GROUP BY year) AS yearly_totals;

5) Averages limited to winning contexts (to test alternative interpretations of "average point")
- Average points for rows where wins > 0: 40.00
- SQL executed:
  SELECT AVG(points) AS average_points FROM alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;

- Average yearly total points considering only years with at least one win: 56
- SQL executed:
  SELECT AVG(total_points) AS average_points
  FROM (
      SELECT year, SUM(points) AS total_points, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
      FROM public.alberto_pagani
      GROUP BY year
      HAVING SUM(wins) > 0
  ) AS yearly_totals;

Assessment
- Part 1: "all of [Alberto Pagani]'s wins are of the 500cc class" — Supported. Data show wins only in 500cc (total 4 wins) and no wins in other classes.
- Part 2: "with an average point of 87" — Not supported. Multiple reasonable interpretations of "average point" yield values far from 87:
  - Average points across all rows: ≈ 9.31
  - Average points per year (aggregated): ≈ 19.29
  - Average points for rows with wins: 40.00
  - Average yearly total points in winning years: 56
  Additionally, the maximum yearly total observed is 91 points (1972), not 87.

Conclusion: The wins being exclusively in 500cc is correct; the stated average points of 87 is not supported by the data under any tested interpretation.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "average point" as the average of the "points" field recorded in the table. To be thorough, also evaluated average per year, average restricted to winning rows, and average per year in winning years. The dataset is assumed authoritative for Alberto Pagani’s recorded seasons and classes.
