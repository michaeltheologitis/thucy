Claim to verify: "in the 1981 open championship no 1 player achieve their position alone , except argentina"

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1981_open_championship (columns: place text, player text, country text, score bigint, "to par" text). This table contains player placements, countries, and scores for the 1981 Open Championship.

What I checked
1) Whether the No. 1 position was held by a single player or was tied.
2) If an Argentine player was an exception who achieved the No. 1 position alone.

Evidence and executed SQL
A) Distinct placement values (to understand tie notation)
- Result: t1, t3, t9 (the prefix 't' indicates a tie)
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place;

B) Who held first place (place = 't1')
- Result shows two players tied for first: Vicente Fernández (Argentina) and Nick Job (England), both at 70 (E).
- SQL:
SELECT player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't1';
- Output (abridged):
  - Player: Vicente Fernández | Country: Argentina | Score: 70 | To Par: E
  - Player: Nick Job          | Country: England   | Score: 70 | To Par: E

C) Full table (for context on ties across placements)
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY place, player;
- Output (abridged):
  - t1: Nick Job (England), Vicente Fernández (Argentina) — both 70 (E)
  - t3: Six players from Australia, United States, Japan, New Zealand, England — all 71 (+1)
  - t9: Eight players from United States, England, Australia, Scotland — all 72 (+2)

Assessment against the claim
- "no 1 player achieve their position alone": Supported. The table explicitly marks first place as t1 (tied), with two players sharing the top position.
- ", except argentina": Not supported. The Argentine player (Vicente Fernández) did not achieve the No. 1 position alone; he shared it with Nick Job (England).

Conclusion
- The data confirm that the No. 1 position was not achieved by a single player. However, the suggestion that Argentina was an exception is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted "no 1 player" as the first-place finisher(s).
- Interpreted "achieve their position alone" as holding the rank without a tie (i.e., not a 't' placement).
- Interpreted ", except argentina" as implying that the Argentine player uniquely held first place, which the data show is false.
