Claim to verify: "Shanghai Pudong International Airport rank 3rd with a total cargo load of 2,939,157 metric tonne."

Data sources explored:
- Database discovery: Found a PostgreSQL database with a public table named world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic.
- Schema inspection: Table columns are rank (bigint), airport (text), code (iata / icao) (text), total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint), % change (text).

Method and evidence:
1) Locate the Shanghai Pudong airport row using a flexible name search.
SQL executed:
SELECT airport, rank, "total cargo (metric tonnes)", "% change"
FROM world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Shanghai%' OR airport ILIKE '%Pudong%'
ORDER BY rank;

Result returned by the query:
- Airport: Shanghai Pudong International Airport
- Rank: 3
- Total cargo (metric tonnes): 2,939,157
- % change: 5.3%

Findings:
- The dataset shows Shanghai Pudong International Airport ranked 3rd with a total cargo figure of 2,939,157 metric tonnes.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions/notes:
- The dataset represents a global ranking of the world’s busiest airports by cargo traffic. The table does not include an explicit year column; verification is therefore tied to the snapshot/version of this dataset available in the connected database.
