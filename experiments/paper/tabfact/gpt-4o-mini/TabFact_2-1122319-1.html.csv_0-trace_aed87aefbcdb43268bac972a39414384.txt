Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix (1964 Austrian Grand Prix results).

Schema examined
- Table: public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix
  - driver (text)
  - constructor (text)
  - laps (bigint)
  - time / retired (text)
  - grid (bigint)

Evidence
1) What happened to the car that started Grid = 1
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired" FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix WHERE grid = 1;
Result:
- Driver: Graham Hill; Constructor: BRM; Laps: 5; Time / Retired: Distributor (retirement)

2) Who completed 105 laps and what was their Time/Retired value
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor, grid, "time / retired"
FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix
WHERE laps = 105;
Results:
- Lorenzo Bandini; Ferrari; Grid: 7; Time / Retired: 2:06:18.23
- Richie Ginther; BRM; Grid: 5; Time / Retired: + 6.18

3) Does any row match all three: grid = 1 AND laps = 105 AND time/retired = '+ 6.18'
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor FROM public.t_1964_austrian_grand_prix
WHERE grid = 1 AND laps = 105 AND "time / retired" = '+ 6.18';
Result: No rows found.

Assessment of the claim
- The statement "1 grid have 105 lap and a time/retire of + 6.18" is not supported by the data.
- In this race, the car with Time/Retired = "+ 6.18" and 105 laps is Richie Ginther, who started from Grid 5, not Grid 1.
- The car that started Grid 1 (Graham Hill) retired after 5 laps (Distributor).

Conclusion
- The combined claim is false for this dataset: the +6.18/105-lap result does not belong to the Grid 1 starter.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "1 grid" as starting position 1 on the grid.
- Interpreted "time / retire" as the column "time / retired" in the provided table.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the available dataset (1964 Austrian Grand Prix).
