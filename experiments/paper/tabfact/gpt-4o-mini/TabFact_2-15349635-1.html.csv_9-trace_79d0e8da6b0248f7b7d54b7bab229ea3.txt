Claim interpreted: In the 1940 Brazilian football standings dataset, (a) no teams are tied on points; and (b) teams that would otherwise be compared are separated by more than 1 goal difference.

Data source explored: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football

Evidence and queries
1) Standings snapshot (to see positions, points, and goal difference)
SQL executed:
SELECT position, team, points, played, against, regexp_replace(difference, '[^0-9-]', '', 'g')::int AS goal_diff_int FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position;
Key rows observed:
- Position 1: flamengo, points=13, goal_diff=8
- Position 2: fluminense, points=13, goal_diff=10
- Position 6: botafogo, points=6, goal_diff=0
- Position 7: vasco da gama, points=6, goal_diff=-2
- Position 8: américa, points=6, goal_diff=-10

2) Are any teams tied on points?
SQL executed:
SELECT points, COUNT(*) AS teams_with_points 
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football 
GROUP BY points 
ORDER BY teams_with_points DESC, points DESC;
Result highlights:
- 6 points: 3 teams
- 13 points: 2 teams
- All other point totals: 1 team each
Conclusion from (2): Multiple ties on points exist (contradicting the claim that no team is tied on points).

3) Among tied-on-points teams, are they separated by more than 1 in goal difference?
SQL executed:
WITH standings AS (
  SELECT position, team, points,
         regexp_replace(difference, '[^0-9-]', '', 'g')::int AS goal_diff
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
), ties AS (
  SELECT points
  FROM standings
  GROUP BY points
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
), ranked AS (
  SELECT s.*, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY s.points ORDER BY s.position) AS rn
  FROM standings s
  JOIN ties t ON t.points = s.points
)
SELECT r1.points,
       r1.team AS team1, r1.goal_diff AS gd1, r1.position AS pos1,
       r2.team AS team2, r2.goal_diff AS gd2, r2.position AS pos2,
       ABS(r1.goal_diff - r2.goal_diff) AS gd_diff
FROM ranked r1
JOIN ranked r2
  ON r1.points = r2.points AND r1.rn + 1 = r2.rn
ORDER BY r1.points DESC, r1.rn;
Result highlights (gd_diff is the absolute difference in goal difference between adjacent teams with same points):
- 13 points: flamengo (GD 8) vs fluminense (GD 10) → gd_diff = 2
- 6 points: botafogo (GD 0) vs vasco da gama (GD -2) → gd_diff = 2; vasco da gama (GD -2) vs américa (GD -10) → gd_diff = 8
Conclusion from (3): Where teams are tied on points, each adjacent pair is separated by more than 1 in goal difference (supports the second part of the claim under this interpretation).

Findings
- The statement “none team tie on point” is contradicted by the data: there are ties at 13 points (2 teams) and 6 points (3 teams).
- The statement “must be separated by more than 1 goal difference” holds true for teams that share the same points in this dataset: all adjacent tied teams differ in goal difference by at least 2.

Overall assessment: The claim mixes a false assertion (no ties on points) with a true assertion (tied teams are separated by more than 1 GD), based on this dataset.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the single available dataset public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- “Goal difference” corresponds to the column difference, parsed to an integer.
- “Separated by more than 1 goal difference” is interpreted as: among teams with equal points, adjacent teams in the standings differ in goal difference by more than 1.
