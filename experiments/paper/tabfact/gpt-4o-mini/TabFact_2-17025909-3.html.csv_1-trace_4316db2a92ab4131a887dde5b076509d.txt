Scope and data sources considered
- Available authoritative data source discovered: PostgreSQL database 'TabFact' with a medal table for the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships (table: t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships). This is the only accessible dataset relevant to medals, so the claim is interpreted within this event’s context.
- Table schema (from schema inspection): columns = rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Locate Australia’s medal row (case-insensitive search)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total
FROM t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Australia%';

Result:
- Rank: 18
- Nation: australia
- Gold: 0
- Silver: 0
- Bronze: 1
- Total: 1

2) Inspect the exact stored nation value to explain case sensitivity
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, octet_length(nation) AS bytes, rank, gold, silver, bronze, total,
       encode(convert_to(nation, 'UTF8'), 'hex') AS nation_hex
FROM t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Australia%';

Result:
- Nation: australia; Bytes: 9; Rank: 18; Gold: 0; Silver: 0; Bronze: 1; Total: 1; Nation_hex: 6175737472616c6961

Conclusion based on data
- In the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships medal table, Australia (stored as lowercase "australia") has Gold = 0. Therefore, within this dataset/event, the claim that Australia did not receive any gold medal is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships because this is the only medals dataset available in the connected authoritative sources.
- The medal table is assumed to comprehensively list nations with their medal counts for this event. Lowercase storage of country names necessitated a case-insensitive match (ILIKE).
