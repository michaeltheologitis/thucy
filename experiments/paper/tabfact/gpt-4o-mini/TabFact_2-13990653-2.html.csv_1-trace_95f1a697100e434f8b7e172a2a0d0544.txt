Claim to verify: “pan wei - lun lose against chinatrust whale.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows that Pan Wei-Lun was credited with the loss in a game against the Chinatrust Whales on 3/23 during the 2007 Uni-President Lions season. The team name in the data is “chinatrust whales” (plural). Therefore, the core claim is supported.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database contents: A PostgreSQL database with a table: public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season containing columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), save (text).

Evidence
1) Context inspection of early-season rows
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season LIMIT 20;
- Relevant returned rows (as displayed by the tool):
  - 3 / 22 | chinatrust whales | 7 - 9 | kao lung - wei | ni fu - deh
  - 3 / 23 | chinatrust whales | 4 - 5 | pan wei - lun | miguel saladin
  This shows a 3/23 game vs chinatrust whales where “loss” is “pan wei - lun”.

2) Targeted verification of the specific matchup and losing pitcher
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent = 'chinatrust whales' AND loss = 'pan wei - lun';
- Result returned by the tool:
  - Date: 3 / 23; Opponent: chinatrust whales; Score: 4 - 5; Loss: pan wei - lun; Save: miguel saladin

Assessment
- The dataset clearly records a game on 3/23 vs the Chinatrust Whales in which Pan Wei-Lun was the losing pitcher. This directly supports the user’s claim. The only minor discrepancy is the singular “whale” in the claim versus the plural “whales” in the data; this does not affect the substance of the claim.

Assumptions
- “lose” is interpreted as “credited with the pitching loss.”
- The claim refers to the 2007 CPBL Uni-President Lions game log represented in the available dataset.
