Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Direct check for Paulo Costa → Trofense in Summer
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE name = 'Paulo Costa' AND "moving to" = 'Trofense' AND "transfer window" = 'Summer';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Any transfer to Trofense (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window", type, source FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE LOWER("moving to") LIKE '%trofense%';
Result:
- Name: Zé Carlos | Moving To: Trofense | Transfer Window: Summer | Type: Contract Termination | Source: apoelfccomcy

3) Any player with name containing both “Paulo” and “Costa”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window", type, source 
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season 
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%paulo%' AND LOWER(name) LIKE '%costa%';
Result:
- Name: Paulo Costa | Moving To: Anorthosis Famagusta | Transfer Window: Winter | Type: Mutual consent loan return | Source: apoelfccomcy

4) Cross-check: any “Costa” moving to Trofense (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "moving to", "transfer window", type 
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season 
WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%costa%' AND LOWER("moving to") LIKE '%trofense%';
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows Zé Carlos moved to Trofense in the Summer window.
- Paulo Costa is present in the data but moved to Anorthosis Famagusta in the Winter window, not to Trofense in Summer.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “Trofense” as CD Trofense (Portugal) and “summer transfer window” as the entry labeled “Summer” in the dataset.
- Verified within the available authoritative dataset for APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season, which contains player movements for that context.
