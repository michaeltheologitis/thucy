Schema (t_1990_91_fa_cup):
- Columns (all text): "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date".

Evidence and executed SQL:

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team", score 
  FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
  WHERE "away team" = 'Liverpool';
- Result: 0 rows (no exact case-sensitive match).

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team", score FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%Liverpool%';
- Result: 1 row
  - Date: 30 / 01 / 1991
  - Home Team: Brighton & Hove Albion
  - Away Team: Liverpool
  - Score: 2 - 3

Analysis:
- The dataset records a match on 30 / 01 / 1991 with Liverpool as the away team and the score listed as 2 - 3. This directly matches the claim about the score on that date with Liverpool away.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data in the 1990–91 FA Cup table.

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the FA Cup dataset for the 1990–91 season available in the database.
