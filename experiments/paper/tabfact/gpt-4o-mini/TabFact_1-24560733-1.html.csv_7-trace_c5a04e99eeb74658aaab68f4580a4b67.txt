Claim interpreted: “The Wildcats lost 1 game in November and 2 games in September.”

Data source discovered

- Table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), wildcats points (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results)
1) Full 1947 game log with dates and outcomes
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "wildcats points", opponents FROM t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;

Result (subset of relevant fields shown):
- Sept 20 | Ole Miss          | Loss | 7  | 14
- Sept 27 | Cincinnati        | Win  | 20 | 0

- Nov 15  | Evansville        | Win  | 36 | 0
- Nov 22  | Tennessee         | Loss | 6  | 13

Findings from the data
- September losses: 1 (Sept 20 vs Ole Miss)
- November losses: 2 (Nov 1 vs Alabama, Nov 22 vs Tennessee)

Conclusion
The data shows the Wildcats lost 1 game in September and 2 games in November, which is the reverse of the claim.

Assumptions
- “Wildcats” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team, specifically the 1947 season (the only available Wildcats dataset discovered).
- “Loss … in November/September” refers to the count of games with result = ‘Loss’ whose date text begins with the respective month abbreviation in the table.
