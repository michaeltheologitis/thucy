Claim interpreted: “There were 3 running backs picked by the 6th round.”

Data sources discovered
- Source: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history (single available table; treated as authoritative per instructions)

Schema check
- Table columns: round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text)
- No year column present.

Evidence from the data
1) Distinct positions present (to understand how running backs are labeled)
SQL:
SELECT position, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY position;
Result (abridged to relevant): includes “Running Back” with count 2 among 13 total entries.

2) Full listing of the table, ordered by round (to see all picks and their rounds/positions)
SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history ORDER BY round, pick, overall, name;
Key rows (relevant to RBs):
- Round 1, Pick 5, Overall 5: Curtis Dickey – Running Back – Texas A&M
- Round 9, Pick 6, Overall 227: Mark Bright – Running Back – Temple

3) Count of running backs drafted by (through) Round 6 (inclusive)
SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE position ILIKE '%Running%' AND round <= 6 ORDER BY round, pick;
Result:
- Curtis Dickey – Round 1, Pick 5, Overall 5 (1 player)

4) Total number of running backs drafted (for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rb FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE position ILIKE '%Running%';
Result: 2

Conclusion based on evidence
- By the end of Round 6, the dataset shows 1 running back selected (Curtis Dickey in Round 1).
- Therefore, the claim that there were 3 running backs picked by the 6th round is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- “run back position” is interpreted as the “Running Back” position in the position column.
- “by the 6th round” is interpreted as inclusive of rounds 1 through 6.
- The claim is evaluated against the only available dataset (public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history), which appears to represent a single draft class (historically consistent with the Colts’ 1980 draft based on names/rounds), since no year column is available to refine scope.
