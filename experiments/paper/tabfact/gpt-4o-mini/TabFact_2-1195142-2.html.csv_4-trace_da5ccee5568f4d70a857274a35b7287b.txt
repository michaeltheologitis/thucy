Claim interpreted: The user’s statement is taken to mean that Gary Beach was one of four Tony Award nominations associated with La Cage aux Folles (2005 Broadway revival), i.e., the production had four Tony Award entries and Gary Beach was among the nominees.

Data source discovery
- Available database schema: public
- Available table: public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical
- Columns: year (bigint), award (text), category (text), nominee (text), result (text)

Evidence
1) Gary Beach’s Tony Award nomination (from La Cage aux Folles data)
SQL: SELECT year, award, category, nominee, result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE nominee ILIKE '%Gary Beach%'
Result: 2005 | Tony Award | Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical | Gary Beach | Nominated

2) Number of Tony Award entries for La Cage aux Folles in 2005
SQL (list rows): SELECT category, nominee, result FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND award ILIKE '%Tony%';
Returned rows (4 total):
- Best Revival of a Musical | Best Revival of a Musical | Won
- Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical | Gary Beach | Nominated
- Best Choreography | Jerry Mitchell | Won
- Best Costume Design | William Ivey Long | Nominated
SQL (count rows): SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND award ILIKE '%Tony%';
Result: count = 4

Conclusion
- The data shows Gary Beach was a Tony Award nominee in 2005 for Best Performance by a Leading Actor in a Musical.
- The same dataset shows there were four Tony Award entries for La Cage aux Folles in 2005. Therefore, Gary Beach was one of four Tony Award nominations associated with that production.

Assumptions
- Because the available dataset is scoped to La Cage aux Folles, “one of four nominee” is interpreted as one of four Tony Award nominations tied to that production in 2005, rather than the total number of nominees in his category across all shows (which this dataset does not enumerate).
