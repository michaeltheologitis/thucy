Claim to verify: The Toronto Blue Jays played the Rangers 3 times in May during the 1991 season.

Data source discovery and structure:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with MLB historical logs.
- Identified table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (1991 season for Toronto Blue Jays).
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Identify all games vs Rangers and inspect dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent 
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Rangers%' 
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- Date: May 1, Opponent: Rangers
- Date: May 7, Opponent: Rangers
- Date: May 8, Opponent: Rangers

2) Count Rangers games specifically in May
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date ILIKE 'May %' AND opponent ILIKE '%Rangers%'
Result:
- 3

3) List May games vs Rangers explicitly (cross-check)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date ILIKE 'May %' AND opponent ILIKE '%Rangers%' ORDER BY date;
Result:
- Date: May 1, Opponent: Rangers
- Date: May 7, Opponent: Rangers
- Date: May 8, Opponent: Rangers

Conclusion:
- The data shows exactly three games against the Rangers in May of the 1991 season (May 1, May 7, May 8). This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- "the ranger" refers to the Texas Rangers of MLB.
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season covers the 1991 MLB regular season for the Toronto Blue Jays, so dates listed (e.g., May 1) are in 1991.
