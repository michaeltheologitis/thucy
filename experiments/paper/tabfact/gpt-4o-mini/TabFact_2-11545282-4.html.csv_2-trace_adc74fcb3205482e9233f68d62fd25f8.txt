Claim interpreted: "Adrian Dantley was on the team the entire time that Brad Davis was." Interpreting "the team" as the Utah Jazz, based on the available data source.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team)

Evidence
1) Adrian Dantley’s tenure with the Jazz
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dantley%';
- Result (relevant fields):
  - Player: Adrian Dantley
  - Years for Jazz: 1979 - 86
  - Position: Guard - Forward
  - School/Club Team: Notre Dame

2) Brad Davis’s tenure with the Jazz
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE LOWER(player) LIKE LOWER('%Brad Davis%');
- Result (relevant fields):
  - Player: Brad Davis
  - Years for Jazz: 1979 - 80
  - Position: Guard
  - School/Club Team: Maryland

Assessment
- Brad Davis is listed as playing for the Jazz during 1979–80.
- Adrian Dantley is listed as playing for the Jazz during 1979–86.
- Therefore, the entire period that Brad Davis was on the Jazz (1979–80) is fully contained within Adrian Dantley’s Jazz tenure (1979–86). This supports the claim as interpreted for the Utah Jazz.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the available roster table.

Assumptions made
- "The team" refers to the Utah Jazz because the only available authoritative data source is the Utah Jazz all-time roster.
- "Entire time" is interpreted over the season-year ranges presented in the table (inclusive of the listed seasons).
