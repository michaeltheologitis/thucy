Summary of findings
- Interpreted claim: The user is asking whether Tommy Robredo was the opponent in the (tennis) final held on July 28, 2013. Based on the available data source (a Fabio Fognini results table), the relevant event is Fabio Fognini’s final on that date.

Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: fabio_fognini.
- Executed SQL (to list tables):
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result: fabio_fognini
- Executed SQL (to list columns):
  SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result (for fabio_fognini): outcome, date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", "score in the final"

Evidence from data
- Query to find finals against Robredo:
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.fabio_fognini WHERE "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%Robredo%';
  Result row:
  - Date: 28 July 2013
  - Opponent in the Final: Tommy Robredo
  - Outcome: Runner - Up
  - Score in the Final: 0 - 6, 3 - 6
  - Surface: Clay
  - Tournament: ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag, Umag, Croatia

Conclusion
- The data shows that on 28 July 2013, Fabio Fognini played the ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag final and his opponent was Tommy Robredo. Therefore, the claim that “Tommy Robredo [was] the opponent on the July 28, 2013 final” is supported by the database.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to professional tennis and specifically to Fabio Fognini’s final on 2013-07-28, since the only available dataset is a Fabio Fognini match table and includes a final on that date.
- Minor formatting differences in date (e.g., “28 July 2013” vs “2013-07-28”) are treated as equivalent for verification purposes.
