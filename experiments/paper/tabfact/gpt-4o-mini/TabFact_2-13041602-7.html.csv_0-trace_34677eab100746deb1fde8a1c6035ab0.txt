Claim interpreted: “the padre be the 2005 milwaukee brewer season opponent 4 time” = The San Diego Padres appeared as the opponent 4 times in the 2005 Milwaukee Brewers season dataset.

Data source explored:
- public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season (columns: date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record)

Evidence 1: Opponent counts
- Result excerpt shows Padres with 4 games.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games_played
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY opponent ASC;
- Returned counts (relevant line): Padres: 4 games

Evidence 2: Detailed rows vs Padres
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record 
FROM public.t_2005_milwaukee_brewers_season 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%padres%' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
- Returned rows:
  • September 1 | Padres | 5 - 6 | Davis (1 - 1) | 24,785 | 65 - 69
  • September 2 | Padres | 12 - 2 | Lawrence (7 - 14) | 18,231 | 66 - 69
  • September 3 | Padres | 1 - 6 | Obermueller (1 - 3) | 32,022 | 66 - 70
  • September 4 | Padres | 3 - 2 | Otsuka (1 - 6) | 20,042 | 67 - 70
