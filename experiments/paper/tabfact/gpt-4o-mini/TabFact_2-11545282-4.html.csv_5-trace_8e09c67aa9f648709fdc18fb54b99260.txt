Claim to verify: "the jazz have 2 player , both guard , with the last name dawkins but their time on the team do not overlap"

What I checked
- Whether the Utah Jazz all-time roster includes players with the last name “Dawkins.”
- How many such players there are, their listed positions, and their tenure years with the Jazz.
- Whether their tenures overlap.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL schema public containing table utah_jazz_all_time_roster.

Table structure (relevant columns)
- player (text)
- position (text)
- years for jazz (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify Jazz players with last name “Dawkins” and show positions and years
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';
Result:
- Darryl Dawkins — Position: Center — Years for Jazz: 1987 - 88
- Paul Dawkins — Position: Guard — Years for Jazz: 1979 - 80

2) Count players named “Dawkins” and list distinct positions
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count, ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT position) AS distinct_positions 
FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%'
Result:
- player_count: 2
- distinct_positions: {center, guard}

3) Normalize tenure years to test overlap (shows start/end years; query returns all players, excerpt includes Dawkins rows)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, "years for jazz", 
    CAST(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '^[0-9]{4}') AS INTEGER) AS start_year, 
    (CAST(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '^[0-9]{4}') AS INTEGER) / 100) * 100 + 
    CAST(RIGHT("years for jazz", 2) AS INTEGER) AS end_year 
FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster;
Relevant rows from the result:
- Darryl Dawkins — Center — 1987 - 88 — start_year: 1987 — end_year: 1988
- Paul Dawkins — Guard — 1979 - 80 — start_year: 1979 — end_year: 1980
Interpretation: 1979–1980 and 1987–1988 do not overlap.

Conclusion
- The Jazz do have two players with the last name Dawkins.
- Their time on the team does not overlap (1979–80 vs 1987–88).
- However, they are not “both guard.” One is a guard (Paul Dawkins) and the other is a center (Darryl Dawkins).

Final assessment of the claim: Partly accurate that there are two “Dawkins” and their tenures don’t overlap, but inaccurate on the positions (not both guards).

Assumptions
- “Jazz” refers to the Utah Jazz franchise as represented in the utah_jazz_all_time_roster table.
- Non-overlap means no shared seasons between the players’ tenure ranges as represented in “years for jazz.”
