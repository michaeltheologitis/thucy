Claim to verify: “pennsylvania17 be the only district that have someone first elect in the 1980s.”

Data source discovered:
- Database: public schema
- Table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (bigint), status (text), opponent (text)

Approach:
- Identify all districts where an incumbent’s “first elected” year falls in the 1980s (1980–1989) and check whether only “Pennsylvania 17” appears.

Evidence:
1) List all districts with incumbents first elected in the 1980s
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected" 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 
WHERE "first elected" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989 
ORDER BY district;
Result excerpt:
- District: Pennsylvania 17 | Incumbent: George Gekas | Party: Republican | First Elected: 1982
- District: Pennsylvania 7  | Incumbent: Curt Weldon  | Party: Republican | First Elected: 1986

2) Count distinct districts with “first elected” in the 1980s
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT district) AS distinct_district_count
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
WHERE "first elected" BETWEEN 1980 AND 1989;
Result: 2 distinct districts

3) Show districts and counts of incumbents first elected in the 1980s
Executed SQL:
SELECT district, COUNT(incumbent) AS incumbent_count
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
WHERE "first elected" >= 1980 AND "first elected" <= 1989
GROUP BY district
ORDER BY incumbent_count DESC, district;
Result:
- Pennsylvania 17 — 1
- Pennsylvania 7  — 1

Conclusion:
The data show two districts—Pennsylvania 17 and Pennsylvania 7—have incumbents whose first election occurred in the 1980s. Therefore, Pennsylvania 17 is not the only district with this characteristic.

Assumptions:
- “someone first elect in the 1980s” is interpreted as the incumbent’s “first elected” year in the provided 1994 House elections table.
- “pennsylvania17” refers to the district labeled “Pennsylvania 17” in the data.
- Verification is limited to the authoritative dataset discovered (the 1994 US House elections table).
