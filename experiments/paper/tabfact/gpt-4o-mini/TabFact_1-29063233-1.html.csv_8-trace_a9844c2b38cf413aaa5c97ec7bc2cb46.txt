Claim assessed: “lucy watkins only write 6 episode of series 2.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows Lucy Watkins wrote exactly one episode of Merlin Series 2: Episode 10, “Sweet Dreams.” Episode 6 was written by Ben Vanstone. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate under the plausible interpretations (only wrote episode 6; or wrote six episodes).

Data source discovery
- Evidence: list available tables
  SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result: public schema contains the table: merlin_series_2

Schema inspection
- Evidence: columns in public.merlin_series_2
  SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'merlin_series_2';
  Result columns:
  - no overall (bigint)
  - no for series (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - directed by (text)
  - written by (text)
  - original air date (text)
  - uk viewers (million) (double precision)

Check if Lucy Watkins wrote episode 6
- Evidence: title and writer for episode 6
  SQL executed:
  SELECT title, "written by" FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE "no for series" = 6;
  Result: Title = “Beauty and the Beast (Part 2)”, Written by = Ben Vanstone

Check how many episodes Lucy Watkins wrote in Series 2
- Evidence: count episodes written by Lucy Watkins
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Lucy Watkins%';
  Result: 1 episode

Identify which episode Lucy Watkins wrote
- Evidence: list episodes where writer is Lucy Watkins
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "no for series", title, "written by" 
  FROM public.merlin_series_2 
  WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Lucy Watkins%';
  Result: no for series = 10, title = “Sweet Dreams”, written by = Lucy Watkins

Context (optional): listing all episodes (by number, title, writer)
- Evidence: series episodes overview
  SQL executed:
  SELECT "no for series", title, "written by" FROM public.merlin_series_2 ORDER BY "no for series";
  Result excerpt:
  - 6: Beauty and the Beast (Part 2) — Ben Vanstone
  - 10: Sweet Dreams — Lucy Watkins

Final assessment based on data
- If the claim means “Lucy Watkins only wrote episode 6 of Series 2”: Contradicted. Episode 6 was written by Ben Vanstone.
- If the claim means “Lucy Watkins wrote six episodes in Series 2”: Contradicted. She is credited with exactly one episode in this table.

Assumptions made due to ambiguous phrasing
- Interpreted “only write 6 episode” as either: (a) “only wrote episode 6,” or (b) “wrote six episodes.” The database table merlin_series_2 is treated as authoritative for Series 2 writing credits.
