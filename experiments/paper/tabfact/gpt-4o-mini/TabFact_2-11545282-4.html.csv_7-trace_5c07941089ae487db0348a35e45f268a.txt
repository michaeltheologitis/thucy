Summary of the claim
- Claim interpreted: Adrian Dantley was on the same team for the entire time that Brad Davis was on that team, and Dantley remained 4 additional years beyond Davis.
- Data environment available: Utah Jazz all-time roster only. I interpret “the team” as the Utah Jazz.

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Data source discovered: A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster.

Step 2: Inspect schema
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)
  - Tenure field: years for jazz (text)

Step 3: Retrieve tenure records for Adrian Dantley and Brad Davis (Utah Jazz)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dantley%' OR player ILIKE '%Davis%';

Results:
- Adrian Dantley | 1979 - 86
- Brad Davis     | 1979 - 80

Analysis grounded in the data
- Overlap/“entire time” check: Brad Davis’s Utah Jazz tenure is listed as 1979–80. Adrian Dantley’s tenure is listed as 1979–86. Therefore, Dantley was on the Jazz during the entire window that Davis was on the team (1979–80).
- Additional years beyond Davis: Using the tenure ranges given:
  - Brad Davis: 1979–80 → approximately 1 season window (1979–80)
  - Adrian Dantley: 1979–86 → approximately 7 season window (1979–80 through 1985–86)
  - Additional seasons Dantley remained beyond Davis ≈ 7 − 1 = 6 seasons (i.e., from 1980–81 through 1985–86)
- The claim that Dantley surpassed Davis by 4 additional years is not supported by the data; the data indicate about 6 additional seasons, not 4.

Conclusion
- True: Dantley was on the team (Utah Jazz) for the entire time Brad Davis was also on the team.
- False: Dantley did not surpass Davis by only 4 additional years; he surpassed by about 6 seasons.

Assumptions
- “The team” refers to the Utah Jazz, as that is the only available data source here.
- “Years” are interpreted in the context of NBA seasons as indicated by the roster’s “years for jazz” text ranges.
- The “years for jazz” ranges are inclusive of the start and end NBA seasons.
