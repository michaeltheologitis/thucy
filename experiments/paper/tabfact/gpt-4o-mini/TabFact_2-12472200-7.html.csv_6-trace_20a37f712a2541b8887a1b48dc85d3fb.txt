Claim to verify: “the furthest Olga Govortsova has ever advanced in a Grand Slam tournament is the second round.”

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data available. In the 2007–2011 period captured in the data source, Olga Govortsova reached the 3rd Round at the French Open (Roland Garros) in 2008 and 2009, which is further than the second round.

What I checked and how

1) Data source discovery
- Connected data sources report: A PostgreSQL database with a table named public.olga_govortsova (discovered via tool). This table contains summarized yearly results for Olga Govortsova across tournaments.

2) Understand the table structure
- Executed SQL (schema introspection):
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default, character_maximum_length 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'olga_govortsova';

  SELECT kcu.column_name, tc.constraint_type 
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
  ON kcu.table_name = tc.table_name AND kcu.table_schema = tc.table_schema AND kcu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name 
  WHERE tc.table_schema = 'public' AND tc.table_name = 'olga_govortsova' AND (tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY' OR tc.constraint_type = 'FOREIGN KEY');

- Result (summary): Columns are tournament (text) and year columns '2007','2008','2009','2010','2011' (text). No PK/FK constraints.

3) Retrieve Grand Slam results rows
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * 
  FROM public.olga_govortsova 
  WHERE tournament IN ('australian open', 'french open', 'wimbledon', 'us open') 
    AND ("2007" IS NOT NULL OR "2008" IS NOT NULL OR "2009" IS NOT NULL OR "2010" IS NOT NULL OR "2011" IS NOT NULL);

- Key returned values (Grand Slams, 2007–2011):
  • Australian Open: 2008 1r; 2009 1r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r (2007: a)
  • French Open: 2008 3r; 2009 3r; 2010 2r; 2011 2r (2007: a)
  • Wimbledon: 2007 2r; 2008 1r; 2009 2r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r
  • US Open: 2007 2r; 2008 2r; 2009 1r; 2010 1r; 2011 1r

Evidence-based assessment
- The French Open row shows “3r” in both 2008 and 2009, which is strictly further than the second round.
- Therefore, within the authoritative data available (2007–2011), the furthest she advanced at a Grand Slam is the third round, contradicting the claim that her best was only the second round.

Answer: Inaccurate. The data shows 3rd Round (French Open 2008 and 2009) as her best Grand Slam results in the period covered.

Assumptions and notes
- Round codes interpreted as standard: 1r = first round, 2r = second round, 3r = third round, etc. Values like ‘a’ denote absent/non-participation.
- The dataset spans 2007–2011. Even within this partial range, the claim is already falsified because 3r > 2r.
