Claim to verify: “usc and clemson college have the most player draft at 3 each.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: indianapolis_colts_draft_history
- Schema: public
- Table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history (round bigint, pick bigint, overall bigint, name text, position text, college text)

Evidence gathered from the data:
1) Count of Indianapolis Colts draft picks by college
Executed SQL:
SELECT college, COUNT(*) AS pick_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college
ORDER BY pick_count DESC, college ASC;

Result snapshot:
- USC: 2
- Clemson: 1
- Georgia: 1
- Kansas State: 1
- Maryland: 1
- Notre Dame: 1
- TCU: 1
- Temple: 1
- Texas: 1
- Texas A&M: 1
- Texas Tech: 1
- Towson: 1

2) Maximum pick count across colleges
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(pick_count) AS max_pick_count
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS pick_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college) AS subquery;

Result:
- max_pick_count = 2

3) Colleges that have the maximum pick count
Executed SQL:
SELECT college
FROM (SELECT college, COUNT(*) AS pick_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college) AS subquery
WHERE pick_count = (SELECT MAX(pick_count)
FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS pick_count
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
GROUP BY college) AS inner_subquery);

Result:
- USC

Conclusion:
- Within the available data (Indianapolis Colts draft history), USC has 2 picks, Clemson has 1 pick, and the maximum by any college is 2 (USC). The claim that “USC and Clemson have the most player draft at 3 each” is contradicted by the data on hand.

Assumptions noted:
- The claim did not specify scope (team, league, or year). I verified it against the authoritative dataset available here: the Indianapolis Colts draft history table (scope limited to this team’s draft picks). If the claim intended a different scope (e.g., an entire league’s draft or a specific year), that would be outside the available data environment.
