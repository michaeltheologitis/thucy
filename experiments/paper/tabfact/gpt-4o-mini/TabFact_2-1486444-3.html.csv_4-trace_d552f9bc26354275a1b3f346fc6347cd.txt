Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that there exists a case where the round is 3 and the time is 3:50 (interpreted within the available data as a fight ending in Round 3 at 3:50) for the accessible dataset of Joachim Hansen’s fight record.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: joachim_hansen_fighter (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location)

Evidence collected:
1) Direct check for Round 3 at Time 3:50
- Result: No rows found.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time, res, location
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
WHERE round = '3' AND time = '3:50';

2) Check for any fights with Time 3:50 (regardless of round)
- Result: Found one fight, but it was Round 2 (not Round 3):
  - Opponent: Metin Yakut; Event: Shooto Finland: Capital Punishment 2; Method: TKO (Punches); Round: 2; Time: 3:50; Result: Win; Location: Helsinki, Finland
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time, res, location FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter WHERE time LIKE '%3:50%';

3) List all Round 3 fights to verify times
- Result: Several Round 3 fights found with times: 2:30, 5:00, 2:33, 5:00, 4:48, 5:00, 5:00, 5:00. None at 3:50.
  - Examples include:
    - vs. Tatsuya Kawajiri — Round 3, Time 2:30
    - vs. Caol Uno — Round 3, Time 4:48
    - Multiple decisions at 5:00
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, method, round, time, res, location
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter
WHERE round = '3';

Conclusion based on evidence: Within the available dataset, there is no instance where a fight ended in Round 3 at 3:50. A time of 3:50 exists, but it corresponds to Round 2.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity):
- The claim refers to the available dataset (Joachim Hansen’s fight records) and asserts an occurrence of a fight ending at 3:50 of Round 3 within this dataset.
- Time format variations (e.g., 03:50) are treated equivalently via substring matching (LIKE '%3:50%'), covering potential formatting differences.
