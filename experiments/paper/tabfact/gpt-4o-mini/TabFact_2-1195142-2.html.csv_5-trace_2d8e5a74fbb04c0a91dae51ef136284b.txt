Claim: “William Ivey Long won the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography.”

Findings based on available data:
- The database records for 2005 Drama Desk awards related to La Cage aux Folles show:
  - Outstanding Choreography — Jerry Mitchell — Won
  - Outstanding Costume Design — William Ivey Long — Nominated
  - Outstanding Revival of a Musical — Won
- There is no record indicating William Ivey Long won Outstanding Choreography in 2005; instead, Jerry Mitchell is recorded as the winner in that category. William Ivey Long is listed as a nominee for costume design, not a choreography winner.

Executed SQL evidence:
- Query:
  SELECT * FROM la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE year = 2005 AND award ILIKE '%Drama Desk%';
- Returned evidence (relevant rows):
  - Award: Drama Desk Award | Category: Outstanding Choreography | Nominee: Jerry Mitchell | Result: Won
  - Award: Drama Desk Award | Category: Outstanding Costume Design | Nominee: William Ivey Long | Result: Nominated
  - Award: Drama Desk Award | Category: Outstanding Revival of a Musical | Nominee: Outstanding Revival of a Musical | Result: Won

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. William Ivey Long did not win the 2005 Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Choreography; Jerry Mitchell did. William Ivey Long was a nominee for Outstanding Costume Design.

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to the 2005 Drama Desk Awards as captured in the la_cage_aux_folles_musical table, which the data indicates includes 2005 Drama Desk results related to the La Cage aux Folles revival.
