Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate for the 1974 U.S. House elections. In 1974, Maryland’s 7th District incumbent and sole candidate was Parren Mitchell (D), unopposed. Goodloe Byron (D) and Elton R. Wampler (R) were candidates in Maryland’s 6th District, not the 7th.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant columns: district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Maryland 7 (target district in the claim)
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
WHERE district ILIKE 'Maryland 7%'

Result:
- District: Maryland 7
- Incumbent: Parren Mitchell
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: 1970
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Parren Mitchell (D) unopposed

2) Maryland 6 (where Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler actually ran in 1974)
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
WHERE district ILIKE 'Maryland 6%';

Result:
- District: Maryland 6
- Incumbent: Goodloe Byron
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: 1970
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Goodloe Byron (D) 73.7%, Elton R Wampler (R) 26.3%

3) Cross-check of all Maryland districts in 1974
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district ILIKE '%Maryland%';

Selected relevant rows from result:
- Maryland 6 — Incumbent: Goodloe Byron; Candidates: Goodloe Byron (D) 73.7%, Elton R Wampler (R) 26.3%
- Maryland 7 — Incumbent: Parren Mitchell; Candidates: Parren Mitchell (D) Unopposed

Assessment
- The data shows that in 1974, Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler were candidates in Maryland’s 6th District, not the 7th. Maryland’s 7th District was represented by Parren Mitchell, who ran unopposed. Therefore, the claim that Maryland District 7’s candidates were incumbent Goodloe Byron and Elton R. Wampler is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim did not specify a year. The verification is grounded in the available authoritative dataset for the 1974 U.S. House elections. If a different year was intended, additional data would be needed, but for 1974 the claim is incorrect.
