Claim interpreted: “there be no home team that score less than 11.” I verify this against the available 1938 VFL season table, interpreting “score” as total points (the number in parentheses in the score string, e.g., 11.23 (89) → 89 points).

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with one table: t_1938_vfl_season (1938 Victorian Football League season).
- Table schema (as reported): columns — "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text). No primary key or relationships.

Understanding score format
- Sample rows inspected to confirm the score format includes total points in parentheses.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", date 
FROM t_1938_vfl_season
LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt (examples provided by the query tool): e.g., Geelong 11.23 (89) vs Hawthorn 6.13 (49), Fitzroy 16.12 (108) vs South Melbourne 8.8 (56), etc.

Primary verification
- Count matches where the home team’s total points (extracted from parentheses) are less than 11.
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) < 11;
Result: 0
- List those matches (for completeness). Returned none.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", date
FROM t_1938_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) < 11;
Result: no rows

Additional corroboration
- Compute min/avg/max of home team total points.
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(total_points) AS min_total_points FROM (SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_points FROM t_1938_vfl_season) AS scores;
Result: 71
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(total_points) AS max_total_points FROM (SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_points FROM t_1938_vfl_season) AS scores;
Result: 108
Executed SQL:
SELECT AVG(total_points) AS avg_total_points FROM (SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_points FROM t_1938_vfl_season) AS scores;
Result: 92.5

Conclusion
- The data shows zero cases where a home team scored fewer than 11 total points. Therefore, within this dataset, the claim is supported.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to total points (the number in parentheses), not goals or behinds separately.
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (1938 VFL season in the provided table).
