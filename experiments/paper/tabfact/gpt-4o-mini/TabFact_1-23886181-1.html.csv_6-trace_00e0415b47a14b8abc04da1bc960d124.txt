Claim interpreted: “Japan is the only football club located in Oceania.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, football club, continent, associated football club, seasons, racing drivers).

Evidence
1) Is there a Japan-related club and what continent is it in?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT no, "football club", continent, "associated football club" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE LOWER("football club") LIKE '%japan%' OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%japan%';
- Result:
  - No: 7; Football Club: team japan; Continent: asia; Associated Football Club: none
- Interpretation: The Japan entry is classified under Asia, not Oceania.

2) Which clubs are located in Oceania?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT no, "football club", continent, "associated football club" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE LOWER(continent) LIKE '%oceania%';
- Results:
  - No: 6; Football Club: Team New Zealand; Continent: Oceania; Associated Football Club: none
  - No: 24; Football Club: Team Australia; Continent: Oceania; Associated Football Club: none
- Interpretation: There are at least two clubs in Oceania, and neither is Japan.

3) Continental categories present (sanity check)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT continent, LENGTH(continent) AS len FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs ORDER BY continent;
- Results:
  - Asia (len 4), Europe (len 6), Oceania (len 7), S America (len 9)
- Interpretation: Oceania is a defined continent category in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The data shows Team Japan is in Asia and there are two clubs in Oceania (Team New Zealand and Team Australia). Therefore, the claim that Japan is the only football club located in Oceania is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Japan” refers to the “team japan” entry in the available Superleague Formula football clubs table.
- “Located in Oceania” refers to rows where the continent column equals or contains “Oceania.”
- Verification is within the scope of the available dataset, treated as authoritative per instructions.
