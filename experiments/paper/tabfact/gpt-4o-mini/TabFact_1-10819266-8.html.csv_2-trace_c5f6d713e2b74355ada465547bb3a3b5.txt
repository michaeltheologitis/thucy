Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the 2007 - 2008 season is the one whose season premiere occurred on September 26, 2007.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.csi_franchise (CSI franchise season data).
- Table columns include: season, episodes, time slot (est), season premiere, season finale, tv season, rank, viewers (in millions).

Evidence from data (SQL and results):
1) SQL executed:
SELECT season, "tv season", "season premiere"
FROM public.csi_franchise
ORDER BY "tv season" ASC;

Key returned rows (relevant excerpt):
- Season: 4 | TV Season: 2007 - 2008 | Season Premiere: september 26 , 2007

Conclusion: The data shows that the 2007 - 2008 TV season has a season premiere date of "september 26 , 2007", which matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the CSI franchise dataset available (which aligns with CSI: NY season timelines), and “season premier” means the season’s first air date as recorded in the "season premiere" field.
- “2007 - 2008” corresponds to the "tv season" field value in the dataset.
