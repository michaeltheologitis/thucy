Claim to verify: “Chauncey Billups led or tied for the lead in assists in 10 out of 13 games.”

Data source discovered
- Available database: public schema with table t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season (2009–10 Denver Nuggets season subset).
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), high assists (text), plus other game metadata.

What the data shows
1) Total games present in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season;
- Result: 13 games.

2) Count of games where Chauncey Billups led or tied for team-high assists
- Logic: In this table, the “high assists” field lists the player(s) with the highest assists for that game. Counting rows where the text contains “Billups” captures both sole leaders and ties.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS billups_lead_or_tie_games FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%billups%';
- Result: 10 games.

3) Details of those games (verification of individual rows)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, "high assists" FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%billups%' ORDER BY game ASC;
- Result (games where Billups led or tied):
  - Game 3: Grizzlies — Chauncey Billups (12)
  - Game 5: Nets — Chauncey Billups (5)
  - Game 7: Hawks — Chauncey Billups (7)
  - Game 8: Bulls — Chauncey Billups (6)
  - Game 9: Bucks — Chauncey Billups, Ty Lawson (5)
  - Game 10: Lakers — Chauncey Billups (8)
  - Game 11: Raptors — Chauncey Billups (10)
  - Game 12: Clippers — Chauncey Billups (7)
  - Game 14: Nets — Chauncey Billups (7)
  - Game 16: Knicks — Chauncey Billups (8)

Additional context (first 15 ordered rows to see the 13-game slice)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, "high assists" FROM t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season ORDER BY game ASC LIMIT 15;
- This shows the 13 games in the dataset span games numbered 3 through 16, and identifies the high-assist player(s) per game. Within these 13, Billups appears as high-assist leader or co-leader in exactly the 10 games listed above.

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset (13 games), Chauncey Billups led or tied for the team lead in assists in 10 of those 13 games. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The verification is grounded in the available 13-game slice present in t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season. We assume the user’s claim refers to this 13-game span covered by the dataset, not the full 82-game season.
