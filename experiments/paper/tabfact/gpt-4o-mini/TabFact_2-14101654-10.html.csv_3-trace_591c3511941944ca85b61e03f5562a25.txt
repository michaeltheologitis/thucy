Claim interpreted: “Only round 3 is not listed two times.” I interpret this to mean that, in the available dataset, every round appears exactly twice except round 3, which does not appear twice.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season (PostgreSQL)

Relevant schema (t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season):
- round (bigint, not null)
- player (text, not null)
- position (text, not null)
- nationality (text, not null)
- "college / junior / club team (league)" (text, not null)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Rows per round (to see which rounds are listed twice)
SQL:
SELECT round, COUNT(*) AS row_count 
FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season 
GROUP BY round 
ORDER BY round ASC;
Result summary:
- Round 3: 1 row
- Round 4: 2 rows
- Round 5: 2 rows
- Round 6: 2 rows
- Round 8: 2 rows
- Round 9: 2 rows

2) Specific check for round 3 count
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS round_3_count 
FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season 
WHERE round = 3;
Result: 1

3) Identify rounds not listed exactly twice
SQL:
SELECT round FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season GROUP BY round HAVING COUNT(*) != 2;
Result: round = 3 (only)

Conclusion:
- The data shows only round 3 deviates from appearing twice; it appears once. All other listed rounds (4, 5, 6, 8, 9) appear exactly twice. This supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions made:
- “Round” refers to the round column in the table public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season.
- “Listed two times” means exactly two rows exist for that round within this table.
- The claim pertains to this dataset and not to external or broader contexts (e.g., other seasons or teams).
