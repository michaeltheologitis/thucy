Claim to verify: “10 of the players were transferred at the end of their contract.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (Rangers FC 2008–09 season transfers)
  - Columns: nat (text), name (text), "moving to" (text), type (text), "transfer window" (text), "transfer fee" (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Distribution of transfer types
- SQL executed:
  SELECT type, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
  GROUP BY type;
- Result:
  - Loan: 20
  - End of contract: 7
  - Transfer: 6

2) Count of players with type = End of contract (robust to case/whitespace)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count, COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS distinct_names_count 
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season 
  WHERE TRIM(LOWER(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result:
  - total_count: 7
  - distinct_names_count: 7

3) Names of players marked as End of contract
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, type 
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season 
  WHERE TRIM(LOWER(type)) = 'end of contract';
- Result (7 players):
  - nicholas gallacher — end of contract
  - lacine cherif — end of contract
  - alistair park — end of contract
  - michael donald — end of contract
  - calum reidford — end of contract
  - chris smith — end of contract
  - jeroen van den broeck — end of contract

Conclusion
- The data shows 7 players departed at the end of their contract, not 10. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be transfer at the end of their contract” as rows where the column type indicates “End of contract.”
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the data in the available table (Rangers FC 2008–09 season).
