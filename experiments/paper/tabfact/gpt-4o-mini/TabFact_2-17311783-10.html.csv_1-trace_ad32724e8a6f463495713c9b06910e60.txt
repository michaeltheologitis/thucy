Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Query
SELECT game, date, team, score, record FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season LIMIT 10;

Result excerpt (relevant row)
- game: 76
- date: april 3
- team: charlotte
- score: w 97 - 92 (ot)
- record: 40 - 36

Interpretation of the evidence
- The table tracks the Miami Heat’s 2008-09 season. In game 76 (April 3), the Heat played Charlotte, won 97 - 92 in overtime, and the Heat’s record improved to 40 - 36.
- Therefore, the record of 40 - 36 belongs to the Miami Heat after beating Charlotte, not to Charlotte. The claim as written states “charlotte improve to 40 - 36 with a win of 97 - 92 in ot,” which incorrectly attributes the win and improved record to Charlotte.

Conclusion
- The score and overtime details are correct for a Heat vs. Charlotte game, but the subject (which team improved to 40 - 36 and won) is wrong. The data shows Miami improved to 40 - 36 with a 97 - 92 OT win over Charlotte, not the other way around.

Assumptions
- “charlotte” refers to the Charlotte NBA team (then the Bobcats) in the context of the 2008-09 NBA season.
- The user’s claim is intended to reference the same game present in the Miami Heat 2008-09 season dataset, which is the only available authoritative source here.
