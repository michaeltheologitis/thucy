Summary conclusion: The data shows the 1997 Pocono 500 (200 laps) winner was Jeff Gordon, not Jeremy Mayfield. Jeremy Mayfield won the Pocono 500 in 1998 and 2000 (both 200 laps), but not in 1997.

Evidence from the database:

1) Confirm available tables and preview contents
- SQL executed:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'pocono_400');

SELECT * FROM public.pocono_400 LIMIT 5;
- Result excerpt (first rows show a 200-lap Pocono race each year, e.g., 1982–1986 with 200 laps and drivers like Bobby Allison, Cale Yarborough, Bill Elliott), indicating this table catalogs the June Pocono race (historically 500 miles = 200 laps).

2) Who is listed for 1997?
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE year = 1997;
- Result:
Year: 1997; Laps: 200; Average Speed (mph): 139.828; Team: Hendrick Motorsports; Manufacturer: Chevrolet; Distance: 500 (804.672); Race Time: 3:34:33; Date: June 8; Driver: Jeff Gordon.
- Interpretation: The 1997 Pocono 500 winner (completing 200 laps) was Jeff Gordon.

3) Does Jeremy Mayfield appear, and when?
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE driver ILIKE '%Mayfield%'
- Result:
• Year 1998: Laps 200; Team: Penske Racing; Manufacturer: Ford; Date: June 21; Driver: Jeremy Mayfield.
• Year 2000: Laps 200; Team: Penske Racing; Manufacturer: Ford; Date: June 19; Driver: Jeremy Mayfield.
- Interpretation: Mayfield won in 1998 and 2000 (both 200-lap Pocono races), not in 1997.

Conclusion: The claim that “Jeremy Mayfield [was] the driver with 200 lap in 1997” is contradicted by the data. For 1997, the driver listed is Jeff Gordon.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “200 lap in 1997” as referring to the 1997 Pocono 500 (a 200-lap race) captured in the public.pocono_400 table. The dataset appears to list winners and key stats for that event by year. If the claim intended a different race or a season-wide metric (e.g., laps led across 1997), that is outside the scope of the available data.
