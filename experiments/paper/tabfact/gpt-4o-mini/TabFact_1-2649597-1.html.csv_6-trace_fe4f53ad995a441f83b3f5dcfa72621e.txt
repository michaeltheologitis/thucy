Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. Using the authoritative dataset available (public.shane_hall), Shane Hall’s overall average finish across 1995–2008 (inclusive) is 28.28 when properly weighting by the number of races each year, not 33.39.

Evidence from data
1) Per-year data used
SQL executed:
SELECT year, races, finish FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;

Returned rows:
- 1995: races=2, finish=24.0
- 1996: races=14, finish=26.4
- 1997: races=28, finish=27.1
- 1998: races=31, finish=24.9
- 1999: races=25, finish=25.8
- 2000: races=2, finish=35.0
- 2001: races=33, finish=27.9
- 2002: races=24, finish=27.0
- 2003: races=5, finish=35.8
- 2004: races=9, finish=31.4
- 2005: races=7, finish=40.9
- 2006: races=9, finish=38.9
- 2008: races=1, finish=43.0

2) Overall average finish (weighted by number of races)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(finish * races) / NULLIF(SUM(races), 0) AS weighted_average_finish,
       AVG(finish) AS unweighted_average_finish,
       SUM(races) AS total_races,
       COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS number_of_years
FROM public.shane_hall
WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;

Results:
- Weighted average finish: 28.28
- Unweighted average of yearly finishes: 31.39
- Total races: 190
- Number of years: 13

Interpretation
- The correct, race-weighted overall average finish for 1995–2008 is 28.28.
- Even the unweighted mean of yearly averages (31.39) does not match the claim of 33.39.

Assumptions
- The column finish represents the average finishing position for each year.
- “Between 1995 – 2008” is interpreted as inclusive of those years and all available rows in that range.
- The appropriate overall average finish across years is computed by weighting each year’s average finish by that year’s number of races: SUM(finish*races)/SUM(races).
