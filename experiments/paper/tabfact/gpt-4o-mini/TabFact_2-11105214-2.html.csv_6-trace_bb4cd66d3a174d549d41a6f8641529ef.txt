GROUP BY "snp 's place 2003";
Result:

2) Count rows where “snp 's place 2003” equals '3rd' and total rows
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_3rd_place FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE "snp 's place 2003" = '3rd';
Result: 0

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
