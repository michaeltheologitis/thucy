Summary of findings
- The available authoritative data source contains Indianapolis Colts draft history. We used it to verify the claim about a Round 9 player named (Glen/Glenn) Capriola and his college.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Search for any player with last name ‘Capriola’
Result: Found one player, “Glenn Capriola,” Round 9, Pick 24, Overall 247, Position: Running Back, College: Boston College.
Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college 
FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%';

2) List all Round 9 picks
Result: Only one Round 9 entry — Glenn Capriola, RB, Boston College; Overall 247; Pick 24.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 9;

3) Check for any Round 9 pick from The Citadel
Result: No rows matched Round 9 with college containing “Citadel.”
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE round = 9 AND college ILIKE '%Citadel%';

Assessment of the claim
- “round 9 involve the player name glen capriola”: Supported (note: the database lists “Glenn” Capriola). 
- “who play college at the citadel”: Not supported. The database shows his college as Boston College, not The Citadel.

Conclusion
- The claim is partly incorrect: the player exists in Round 9, but his college is Boston College, not The Citadel.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Indianapolis Colts’ draft history (the only available data source). 
- Treated “glen capriola” as “Glenn Capriola” (spelling as listed in the database).
