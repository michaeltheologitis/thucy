Evidence gathered from the data

  SELECT date, venue, score, comp FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%';
- Result (returned by the tool):
  | Date           | Venue                                           | Score               | Competition |

  | 1998 - 06 - 28 | stade félix bollaert lens , france              | 0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet ) | world cup   |

2) Total count of World Cup entries in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%';
- Result: 4

3) Dates and venues of the World Cup entries (ordered)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%' ORDER BY date;
- Result (returned by the tool):
  1) Date: 1998-06-12 — Venue: Stade de la Mosson, Montpellier, France
  2) Date: 1998-06-19 — Venue: Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Étienne, France
  3) Date: 1998-06-24 — Venue: Stade de Toulouse, Toulouse, France
  4) Date: 1998-06-28 — Venue: Stade Félix Bollaert, Lens, France

4) Check that all those World Cup entries have venues in France
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%' AND venue NOT ILIKE '%france%';
- Result: 0 (i.e., all listed World Cup matches in the dataset are in France)

Findings
- The dataset contains exactly 4 records labeled as World Cup matches, all dated in June 1998 and all with venues in France.

Conclusion
- Within the scope of the available data (Paraguayan football in 1998), the statement is supported: there are 4 World Cup matches recorded for June 1998, and all are in France.
- Note: The claim, as phrased, could be interpreted as referring to the entire World Cup tournament. Our available data only covers entries in the Paraguayan 1998 dataset and cannot verify the count of matches for the entire tournament.

Assumptions made
- The claim is interpreted in the context of the available dataset (Paraguayan football 1998), i.e., referring to the World Cup matches recorded therein (which are Paraguay’s World Cup matches).
- We assume the text values in the venue field reliably indicate country by containing the substring “France.”
