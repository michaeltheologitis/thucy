Data sources explored
- Discovered data sources
  - Tool: functions.discover_data_sources

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate any game(s) with score exactly “W 112 - 91” (case-insensitive)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, score FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE LOWER(score) = LOWER('W 112 - 91') ORDER BY game ASC;
- Result:
  - Game: 67; Date: March 19; Score: w 112 - 91

2) Confirm uniqueness (count matches)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE LOWER(score) = LOWER('W 112 - 91')
- Result:
  - row_count: 1

Conclusion
- The only occurrence of the score “W 112 - 91” in the available 1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics dataset is dated “March 19.” Therefore, the date for that score is not after March 19; it is exactly March 19.

Assumptions
- “After March 19” is interpreted strictly as later than March 19 (not including March 19 itself).
- The claim pertains to the Seattle SuperSonics 1991–92 season data contained in the provided table, whose date field is stored as text without a year.
