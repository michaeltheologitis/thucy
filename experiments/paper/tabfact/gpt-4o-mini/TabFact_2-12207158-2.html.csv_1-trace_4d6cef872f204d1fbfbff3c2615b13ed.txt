Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season (date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

What I checked and evidence:
1) Identify the exact row for April 11
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date = 'april 11'
- Result summary: date = april 11; opponent = yankees; record = 4 - 4; score = 11 - 6 (10); loss = righetti (0 - 1); attendance = 20,277

2) Compare surrounding dates to see when 4 - 5 occurred
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, record FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date IN ('april 10', 'april 11', 'april 12', 'april 13') ORDER BY date;
- Result summary:
  - April 10: opponent = Yankees, record = 3 - 4
  - April 11: opponent = Yankees, record = 4 - 4
  - April 12: opponent = Yankees, record = 4 - 5

3) Directly search for when the record was 4 - 5
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE record = '4 - 5';
- Result summary: date = April 12; opponent = Yankees

Findings:
- On April 11, the opponent was the Yankees, but the Blue Jays’ record was 4 - 4 on that date.
- The record of 4 - 5 occurred on April 12, also against the Yankees.

Conclusion:
- The claim that “when the record be 4 - 5, the opponent be Yankee on April 11” is not supported by the data. The opponent portion (Yankees) is true for April 11, but the record on that date was 4 - 4, not 4 - 5. The 4 - 5 record is recorded on April 12.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1989 Toronto Blue Jays season, consistent with the available data table and its contents.
