Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema with table t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (1997 Colorado Rockies game log). Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text; winner’s runs first), loss (text; losing pitcher with post-game record), attendance (bigint), record (text; Rockies’ team record after the game).

What the data shows
1) Games on August 29–31, 1997
- Evidence (executed SQL):
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record 
  FROM t_1997_colorado_rockies_season 
  WHERE date IN ('august 29', 'august 30', 'august 31') 
  ORDER BY date;
- Result:
  • August 29 — Opponent: Mariners; Score: 6 - 5; Loss: Timlin (3 - 3); Record: 66 - 70
  • August 30 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 4 - 3; Loss: mohler (1 - 10); Record: 67 - 70
  • August 31 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 10 - 4; Loss: oquist (2 - 5); Record: 68 - 70

Interpretation:
- August 30: Rockies won 4–3; the losing pitcher was mohler (1–10).
- August 31: Rockies won 10–4; the losing pitcher was oquist (2–5).

2) Specific checks for “mohler” and “oquist”
- Evidence (executed SQL to find any game with mohler as losing pitcher):
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record 
  FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season 
  WHERE LOWER(loss) LIKE '%mohler%';
- Result: August 30 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 4 - 3; Loss: mohler (1 - 10); Record: 67 - 70

- Evidence (executed SQL to find any game with oquist as losing pitcher):
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record 
  FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season 
  WHERE loss ILIKE '%oquist%';
- Result: August 31 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 10 - 4; Loss: oquist (2 - 5); Record: 68 - 70

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “in a game on august 30, mogler (1 - 10) won while in a game against oquist.”
- Findings:
  • On August 30, the losing pitcher was mohler (1–10). He did not win; the Rockies won the game 4–3 while mohler took the loss.
  • Oquist appears as the losing pitcher on August 31, not August 30.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim. Mohler (spelled “mohler” in the data) did not win on August 30; he was the losing pitcher. The reference to a game “against Oquist” aligns with August 31, not August 30.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “mogler” as “mohler” based on the dataset’s entry “mohler (1 - 10).”
- Interpreted “won” as referring to the pitcher’s decision (i.e., being the winning pitcher), and used the table’s “loss” column to determine the actual losing pitcher on each date.
- Interpreted the timeframe as 1997 (the scope of the available dataset).
