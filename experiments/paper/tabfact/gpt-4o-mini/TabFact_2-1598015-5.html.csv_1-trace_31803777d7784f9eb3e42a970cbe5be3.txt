Claim interpreted: For the PGA Championship row, top-25 is less than 4, wins = 0, cuts made = 6, and top-5 > 0.

What the data shows
1) Full table contents for context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.chris_dimarco;
- Result (relevant row):
  • Tournament: PGA Championship
  • wins: 0
  • top - 5: 1
  • top - 10: 1
  • top - 25: 4
  • events: 10
  • cuts made: 8

2) Direct test of the stated conditions
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.chris_dimarco WHERE tournament = 'PGA Championship' AND "top - 25" < 4 AND wins = 0 AND "cuts made" = 6 AND "top - 5" > 0;
- Result: No rows returned (no records match all those conditions).

Assessment by condition (PGA Championship row)
- top-25 < 4: False (data shows 4, which is not less than 4)
- wins = 0: True (wins = 0)
- cuts made = 6: False (data shows 8)
- top-5 > 0: True (top-5 = 1)

Conclusion: The claim mixes true and false elements; importantly, the strict filters do not match the data for the PGA Championship row.

Assumptions made
- “PGA Championship” refers to the row labeled exactly “PGA Championship” in public.chris_dimarco (Chris DiMarco’s major-championship stats).
- “less than 4” is interpreted as strictly < 4, not ≤ 4.
- Column names with spaces/hyphens are used verbatim as in the table (e.g., "top - 25", "cuts made").
