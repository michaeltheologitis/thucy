Claim interpreted: “The artist with a mintage of 41,828 is Bonnie Ross.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public
- Table: royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s (year bigint, theme text, artist text, mintage text, issue price double precision). Note: mintage is stored as text and may include formatting.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any coin with mintage exactly equal to '41,828', '41828', or containing '41 828'
SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE mintage = '41,828';
Result: No rows returned

SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE mintage = '41828';
Result:
- Year: 2001; Theme: The Russell Light Four; Artist: John Mardon; Mintage: 41828

SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE mintage LIKE '%41 828%';
Result: No rows returned

Finding from (1): The dataset has a coin with mintage 41,828 and its artist is John Mardon, not Bonnie Ross.

2) Check whether any entry references Bonnie Ross
SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage 
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s 
WHERE artist ILIKE '%Bonnie Ross%';
Result:
- Year: 2002; Theme: The William Lawrence; Artist: Bonnie Ross; Mintage: Included in the Gray - Dort

Finding from (2): Bonnie Ross appears as an artist in the dataset, but not associated with a numeric mintage of 41,828.

3) Directly test if any row has both normalized mintage 41,828 and artist containing 'Bonnie Ross'
SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
WHERE REGEXP_REPLACE(mintage, '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::bigint = 41828
AND artist ILIKE '%Bonnie Ross%';
Result: No rows returned

Conclusion
- The database shows the coin with mintage 41,828 is associated with artist John Mardon (not Bonnie Ross).
- Bonnie Ross does appear in the dataset but in association with a different entry and non-numeric mintage text.
- Therefore, the claim that “the artist with a mintage of 41,828 is Bonnie Ross” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the “mintage” field value equal to 41,828 within the available Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins (2000s) dataset.
- Minor formatting differences in the mintage (commas/spaces) were considered; normalization checks were performed where applicable.
