What I verified
- Claim interpreted: whether the play “reasons to be pretty” received more than one nomination in a “Best Play”-type top play category across recognized award bodies.

Available data source
- Database: TabFact
- Table: reasons_to_be_pretty
  - Columns: year (bigint), award ceremony (text), category (text), nominee (text), result (text)

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Check for categories explicitly containing the phrase “best play”
SQL:
SELECT year, category, nominee, result
FROM reasons_to_be_pretty
WHERE category ILIKE '%best play%';
Result:
- 2009 | best play | neil labute | nominated
Interpretation: One nomination in a category explicitly named “best play” (Tony Award).

2) Check for Drama Desk “Outstanding Play” (a top play category analogous to Best Play)
SQL:
SELECT year, category, nominee, result
FROM reasons_to_be_pretty
WHERE category ILIKE 'outstanding play';
Result:
- 2009 | outstanding play | outstanding play | nominated
Interpretation: One nomination in Drama Desk’s top play category (“Outstanding Play”).

3) Count nominations in top play categories
SQL:
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE category ILIKE '%best play%' AND result ILIKE 'nomin%') AS count_best_play,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE (category ILIKE '%best play%' OR category ILIKE 'outstanding play') AND result ILIKE 'nomin%') AS count_top_play_any
FROM reasons_to_be_pretty;
Result:
- count_best_play = 1
- count_top_play_any = 2

Conclusion
- Literal “Best Play” category: 1 nomination (Tony Award, 2009).
- Including equivalent top play category (“Outstanding Play” at Drama Desk): total of 2 nominations in 2009.

Therefore, the statement that it was nominated for “best play” more than once is supported if “best play” is interpreted broadly to include equivalent top play categories across award bodies; if interpreted strictly as the literal category name “Best Play,” it occurred once.

Assumptions
- “Best Play” may reasonably encompass equivalent top play categories used by different award organizations (e.g., Drama Desk “Outstanding Play”).
- The reasons_to_be_pretty table consolidates this play’s award history for the relevant awards and year(s).
