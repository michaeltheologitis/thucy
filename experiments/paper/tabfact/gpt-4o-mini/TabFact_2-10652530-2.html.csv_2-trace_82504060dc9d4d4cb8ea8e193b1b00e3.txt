Conclusion: The October 17, 2004 game corresponds to Week 6.

Evidence from data (Cleveland Browns 2004 season):
- Result row for Week 6 shows the game date as October 17, 2004.
- Additional details: Opponent = Cincinnati Bengals, Result = W 34-17, Stadium = Cleveland Browns Stadium, Record after game = 3-3, Attendance = 73,263.

Executed SQL (with results):
1) Query
SELECT * FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season WHERE week = 6;
Result
- week: 6
- date: October 17, 2004
- opponent: Cincinnati Bengals
- result: W 34 - 17
- stadium: Cleveland Browns Stadium
- record: 3 - 3
- attendance: 73263

Assumptions and notes:
- The available data source covers the Cleveland Browns’ 2004 season only; conclusions apply to that team’s schedule.
- The user’s phrasing was interpreted as asking which week the October 17, 2004 game was played (Week 6), or conversely, on what date Week 6 was played (October 17, 2004).
