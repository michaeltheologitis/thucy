Claim to verify: “a total of 2 game and 2 leg that have the score of 0 - 0.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single table: t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs)

Relevant schema
- Columns (all text): "team 1", "team 2", "agg", "1st leg", "2nd leg"
- Legs are recorded in "1st leg" and "2nd leg"; aggregate tie result is recorded in "agg".

Evidence and executed SQL
1) How many ties (games as aggregate outcomes) are 0-0?
- Distinct aggregate formats containing zeros and a dash:
  SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT agg FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE agg LIKE '%0%' AND (agg LIKE '%-%' OR agg LIKE '%–%');
  Result: ["0 - 0 (1 - 3)", "4 - 0"]

- Count of rows where aggregate starts with 0-0 (allowing spaces/hyphen and trailing notes):
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS score_count 
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
  WHERE TRIM(REGEXP_REPLACE(agg, '[ -]', '', 'g')) LIKE '00%';
  Result: 1

- The specific tie with 0-0 aggregate:
  SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg" 
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
  WHERE "agg" LIKE '0-0%' OR "agg" LIKE '0 - 0%';
  Result: team 1 = port autonome; team 2 = sporting clube da praia; agg = 0 - 0 (1 - 3)

Conclusion for aggregate “games”: 1 tie with 0-0, not 2.

2) How many individual legs are 0-0?
- Count rows with 0-0 score in the 1st leg:
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_first_leg FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "1st leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0');
  Result: 2

- Count rows with 0-0 score in the 2nd leg:
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_second_leg FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "2nd leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0');
  Result: 1

- Combined total (1st + 2nd leg occurrences):
  SQL:
  SELECT (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "1st leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0')) + (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "2nd leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0')) AS combined_total;
  Result: 3

- Rows where 1st leg is 0-0:
  SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" 
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
  WHERE "1st leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0');
  Results:
  1) port autonome vs sporting clube da praia — 1st leg: 0 - 0; 2nd leg: 0 - 0
  2) tourbillon fc vs forces armées ca — 1st leg: 0 - 0; 2nd leg: 1 - 1

- Row where 2nd leg is 0-0:
  SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "2nd leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0');
  Result:
  port autonome vs sporting clube da praia — 1st leg: 0 - 0; 2nd leg: 0 - 0

- Rows where both legs are 0-0:
  SQL:
  SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg" 
  FROM t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
  WHERE ("1st leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0')) 
  AND ("2nd leg" IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0 : 0'));
  Result: port autonome vs sporting clube da praia — agg: 0 - 0 (1 - 3)

Conclusion for legs: There are 3 legs with a 0-0 score, not 2.

Overall conclusion
- Aggregate 0-0 “games” (ties): 1
- Individual 0-0 legs: 3
- The claim of “2 game and 2 leg that have the score of 0 - 0” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Game” is interpreted as the aggregate tie outcome recorded in the agg column (one fixture spanning two legs). “Leg” is interpreted as an individual match recorded in the 1st leg or 2nd leg columns.
- 0-0 formats considered include '0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', and '0 : 0'; aggregate 0-0 may include trailing notes such as penalties (e.g., '0 - 0 (1 - 3)').
