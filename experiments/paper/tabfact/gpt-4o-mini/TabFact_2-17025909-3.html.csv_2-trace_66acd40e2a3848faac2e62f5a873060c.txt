Summary
- Claim: "the nation of croatia receive less than 2 silver medal with a total medal of only 1"
- Finding: The data shows Croatia earned 2 silver medals and 3 total medals at the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships (columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate Croatia’s row (pattern match to ensure we capture any minor name variations)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE nation ILIKE '%croa%';
- Result:
  Nation: Croatia; Gold: 0; Silver: 2; Bronze: 1; Total: 3

2) Confirm counts and recompute total for Croatia (case-insensitive exact match)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total, (gold + silver + bronze) AS computed_total 
  FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships 
  WHERE LOWER(nation) = LOWER('Croatia');
- Result:
  Nation: Croatia; Gold: 0; Silver: 2; Bronze: 1; Total: 3; Computed Total: 3

Assessment of the claim
- "less than 2 silver medal": False. Croatia has 2 silver medals (not less than 2).
- "total medal of only 1": False. Croatia has 3 total medals.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: Croatia earned 2 silver medals and 3 total medals at the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships.

Assumptions
- Because the only available authoritative dataset concerns the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships, the claim was interpreted as referring to that event’s medal table.
