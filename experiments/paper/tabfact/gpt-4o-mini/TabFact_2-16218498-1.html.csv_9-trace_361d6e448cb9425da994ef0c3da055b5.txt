Summary
- Claim interpreted: There are more than two teams that recorded the same score during the 1st leg.
- Result: Verified. Multiple goal tallies in the 1st leg were shared by more than two teams (e.g., eight teams scored exactly 1 goal).

Data source discovery
- Available database: 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs
- Table: public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
- Columns: "team 1" (text), agg (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Schema detail (tool evidence)
- The table contains first-leg scores in the column "1st leg" formatted as "X - Y" where X is goals by team 1 and Y is goals by team 2.

Evidence and SQL
1) Count of teams sharing the same number of goals in the 1st leg (both teams per match)
- Result: Goals=1 → 8 teams; Goals=0 → 6 teams; Goals=2 → 3 teams; Goals=3 → 3 teams. All exceed 2 teams sharing the same goal tally.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT goals, COUNT(*) AS team_count
FROM (
    SELECT CAST(split_part("1st leg", ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) AS goals
    FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
    UNION ALL
    SELECT CAST(split_part("1st leg", ' - ', 2) AS INTEGER) AS goals
    FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
) AS parsed_scores
GROUP BY goals
HAVING COUNT(*) > 2
ORDER BY team_count DESC, goals ASC;
- Returned counts:
  • Goals: 1 | Count of Teams: 8
  • Goals: 0 | Count of Teams: 6
  • Goals: 2 | Count of Teams: 3
  • Goals: 3 | Count of Teams: 3

2) Example teams that scored exactly 1 goal in the 1st leg (up to 10 sample rows)
- Result (sample):
  • botswana defence force xi | 1 - 1 | team 1
  • lprc oilers | 1 - 0 | team 1
  • asc police | 1 - 1 | team 1
  • saint - louis fc | 1 - 3 | team 1
  • mbabane highlanders | 1 - 1 | team 2
  • as real bamako | 1 - 1 | team 2
  • al ittihad | 2 - 1 | team 2
  • postel sport | 2 - 1 | team 2
- Executed SQL (two parts used to gather examples):
1) Team 1 scoring 1 goal:
SELECT "team 1", "1st leg", 'team 1' AS team_position
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE SPLIT_PART("1st leg", ' - ', 1)::int = 1;
2) Team 2 scoring 1 goal:
SELECT "team 2", "1st leg", 'team 2' AS team_position
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE SPLIT_PART("1st leg", ' - ', 2)::int = 1;

Conclusion
- The data shows several goal tallies in the 1st leg shared by more than two teams (e.g., 1 goal by 8 teams, 0 goals by 6 teams). Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “same score during the 1st leg” to mean “the same number of goals scored by a team in the 1st leg,” not necessarily identical match scorelines across fixtures. The verification remains valid under this interpretation because multiple teams share identical goal totals in that leg.
