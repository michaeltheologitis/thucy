Claim interpreted: “Lauren Gussis is not an episode director for Dexter.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with a single table public.dexter_season_3 containing episode-level metadata for Dexter Season 3 (columns: no in series, no in season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, us viewers (millions)).

Evidence from the data
1) Check whether any Season 3 episode lists Lauren Gussis as a director
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title, "directed by" FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%gussis%';
- Result: 0 rows (no Season 3 episode is directed by a person with surname “Gussis”).

2) List all distinct directors credited in Season 3 (to show who did direct)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count
  FROM public.dexter_season_3
  GROUP BY "directed by"
  ORDER BY "directed by";
- Result summary:
  - ernest dickerson — 1 episode
  - john dahl — 2 episodes
  - keith gordon — 2 episodes
  - marcos siega — 4 episodes
  - steve shill — 1 episode
  (Lauren Gussis does not appear among Season 3 directors.)

3) Check whether Lauren Gussis is credited in Season 3 in another capacity (e.g., writer) for context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title, "written by"
  FROM public.dexter_season_3
  WHERE LOWER("written by") LIKE '%gussis%';
- Results:
  - No in Season: 7 | Title: easy as pie | Written By: lauren gussis
  - No in Season: 11 | Title: i had a dream | Written By: charles h eglee and lauren gussis

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative Season 3 dataset available, Lauren Gussis is not credited as the director of any Dexter Season 3 episode. She is credited as a writer on two Season 3 episodes. The data available does not cover other seasons, so we cannot make a definitive, series-wide determination from this source alone.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The claim appears to apply to the entire Dexter series; however, the only available data source covers Season 3. My verification is therefore limited to that season.
