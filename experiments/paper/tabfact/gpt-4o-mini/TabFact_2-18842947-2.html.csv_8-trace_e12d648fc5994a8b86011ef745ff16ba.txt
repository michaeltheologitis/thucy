Claim: "the most point score by the lion in a single game be 58"

Scope and data sources explored:
- Available data source: Database TabFact, schema public, table t_1976_detroit_lions_season (week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint). This table contains the Detroit Lions’ 1976 NFL season game results with scores embedded in the result column.

Method:
- Interpret the Lions’ points as the first number in the score embedded in the result string (e.g., in "W 41-14", Lions scored 41).
- Compute the maximum of that first number across all 1976 games and list the game(s) where it occurs.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve game results (context check):
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE result ILIKE 'W%' OR result ILIKE 'L%'
ORDER BY date;

2) Compute the maximum points scored by the Lions in a single game in 1976:
SQL:
SELECT MAX(points) AS max_points
FROM (
    SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING(result FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) AS points
    FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
    WHERE result ILIKE 'W%' OR result ILIKE 'L%'
) AS scores;
Result: max_points = 41

3) List the game(s) where this maximum occurred:
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
WHERE result ILIKE 'W%' OR result ILIKE 'L%'
AND CAST(SUBSTRING(result FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) = 41;
Result rows:
- Date: October 24, 1976; Opponent: Seattle Seahawks; Result: W 41-14

Findings:
- Within the 1976 Detroit Lions season data, the most points the Lions scored in a single game was 41 (versus the Seattle Seahawks on October 24, 1976), not 58.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the most points scored by the Lions in a single game is 58 is not supported by the available 1976 season data; the maximum is 41.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity and dataset scope):
- "lion" is interpreted as the Detroit Lions NFL team.
- "most point score" is interpreted as the maximum points scored by the team in a single game.
- Verification is constrained to the available dataset (the 1976 season). No broader franchise-wide or multi-season data were available to check beyond 1976.
