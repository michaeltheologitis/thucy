Claim interpreted: In the 2010 Vuelta a España dataset, Stage 1 is the only stage where the mountains classification was not awarded.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with schema public.
- Identified table: public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a (2010 Vuelta a España stage and jersey data).

Schema evidence
- Executed SQL to list tables:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result: t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
- Executed SQL to list columns for public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a';
  Result columns:
  - stage (bigint)
  - winner (text)
  - general classification (text)
  - points classification (text)
  - mountains classification (text)
  - combination classification (text)
  - team classification (text)

Verification evidence
- Executed SQL to find stages where the mountains classification was not awarded or missing (NULL, empty string, whitespace-only, '-', '—', 'n/a', 'na', 'not awarded'):
  SELECT stage, "mountains classification" 
  FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a 
  WHERE "mountains classification" IS NULL 
     OR TRIM("mountains classification") = '' 
     OR "mountains classification" IN ('-', '—', 'n/a', 'na', 'not awarded');
  Result:
  - Stage 1, Stored Value: 'not awarded'
  No other stages matched these missing/not-awarded criteria in the dataset.

Conclusion
- The data shows Stage 1 is the only stage where the mountains classification was recorded as not awarded. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2010 Vuelta a España (the only available dataset).
- “Wasn't award” is interpreted as the mountains classification field being absent or explicitly marked not awarded in the dataset (values treated as missing: NULL, empty, '-', '—', 'n/a', 'na', 'not awarded').
