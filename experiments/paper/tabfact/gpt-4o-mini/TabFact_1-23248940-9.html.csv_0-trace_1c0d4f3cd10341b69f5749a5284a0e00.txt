Claim to verify: “the lowest attendance figure for a game be 12376.”

Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (Charlotte Bobcats 2009–2010 season). Relevant column: “location attendance” (text) containing venue name followed by the numeric attendance.

Method:
- Parse the attendance as the integer digits within the “location attendance” field and compute the minimum across all games. Then list the game(s) matching that minimum.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Compute minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT MIN(CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS min_attendance
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
Result: 12,376

2) Retrieve the game(s) with the minimum attendance
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance"
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) = 12376;
Result: Game 50 | Date: February 9 | Opponent: Washington | Location Attendance: Time Warner Cable Arena 12,376

Conclusion:
- The lowest attendance in the dataset is 12,376. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Game” refers to games in the available dataset: the Charlotte Bobcats 2009–2010 season table. Attendance is taken as the numeric value embedded in the “location attendance” text field.
