Interpreted claim: The player who moved to Paphos (AEP Paphos) was of Macedonian (MKD) nationality and left by release (mutual consent).

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema
- Table: t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season (columns: nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source)

Evidence 1: Transfers with destination including “Paphos”
- Result: One record found — Player: Nikolovski; Nationality: MKD; Destination: AEP Paphos; Type: Mutual Consent; Transfer Window: Winter; Fee: Free.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee" 
FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
WHERE "moving to" ILIKE '%Paphos%';

Evidence 2: Entries with nationality containing “MKD”
- Result: One matching record — moving to: aep paphos; name: nikolovski; nat: mkd; transfer window: winter; type: mutual consent; fee: free.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season WHERE nat ILIKE '%MKD%'

Analysis:
- The only Paphos-bound record shows the player is of MKD nationality and the departure type is “Mutual Consent,” which is a form of release/contract termination.

Conclusion:
- The data supports that the AEP Paphos-bound player (Nikolovski) is MKD and left by release (mutual consent), during the winter window, on a free.

Assumptions made due to ambiguous phrasing:
- “release” is interpreted as a contract termination by mutual consent.
- “by mkd” is interpreted as the player’s nationality being MKD (North Macedonia), not an entity performing the release.
- “paphos” refers to AEP Paphos, as listed in the dataset.
