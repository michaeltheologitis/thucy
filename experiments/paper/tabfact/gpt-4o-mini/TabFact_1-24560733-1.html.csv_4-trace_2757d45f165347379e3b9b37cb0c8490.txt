Claim interpreted: “The most the Wildcats outscored an opponent was by 36 points.” We verify this against the available data for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team.

Findings:
- The maximum single-game point margin for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats is 36 points.
- This occurred against Evansville on November 15, 1947, in a 36–0 game.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the top point differential and the corresponding game
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, ("wildcats points" - opponents) AS point_differential 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
ORDER BY point_differential DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result summary: Date = November 15, 1947; Opponent = Evansville; Wildcats Points = 36; Opponents Points = 0; point_differential = 36.

2) List any game(s) with a 36-point margin
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE ("wildcats points" - opponents) = 36;
Result summary: Shows the Evansville game on November 15, 1947 (36–0).

3) Compute the maximum margin directly
SQL:
SELECT MAX("wildcats points" - opponents) AS max_point_margin FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team;
Result: max_point_margin = 36.

Conclusion: The data confirms that the largest margin by which the (1947 Kentucky) Wildcats outscored an opponent is 36 points.

Assumptions due to ambiguity:
- “Wildcats” is interpreted as the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team because that is the available data source.
- “Most outscore an opponent” is interpreted as the largest single-game point differential (Wildcats points minus opponents’ points).
