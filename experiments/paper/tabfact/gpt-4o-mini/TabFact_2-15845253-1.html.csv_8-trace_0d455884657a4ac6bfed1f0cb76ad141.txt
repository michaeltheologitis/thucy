Claim to verify: “only 1 of the viral disease be in Baltimore group III.”

Data discovery:
- Available source: one PostgreSQL table public.viral_disease (TabFact database).
- Relevant columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text). No primary keys.

Evidence 1: Count of entries by Baltimore group
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "baltimore group", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "baltimore group";
- Result:
  - group i: 5
  - group ii: 1
  - group iii: 1
  - group iv: 7
  - group v: 7
  - group vi: 1
  - group vii: 1

Evidence 2: Retrieve entries labeled as Group III
- Executed SQL:
SELECT family, "baltimore group", envelopment, "virion shape", "replication site" 
FROM public.viral_disease 
WHERE LOWER("baltimore group") = 'group iii';
- Result (1 row):
  - Family: Reoviridae; Baltimore Group: Group III; Envelopment: Non-enveloped; Virion Shape: Icosahedral; Replication Site: Cytoplasm

Conclusion:
- The data show exactly 1 entry in Baltimore Group III. This supports the claim that only one viral disease entry is in Baltimore Group III in the given dataset.

Assumptions:
- “viral disease” refers to rows in public.viral_disease of the TabFact database.
- “Baltimore group iii” corresponds to the value “Group III” regardless of letter casing.
- “only 1” means the count of rows labeled Group III equals 1.
