Claim interpreted: The episode titled “arienai kisu” was broadcast exactly 14 days after the episode with the earliest broadcast date in the dataset.

Data source exploration
- Available database: tsuki_no_koibito
- Table: tsuki_no_koibito (columns: "episode title", "romanized title", "translation of title", "broadcast date", "ratings").

Key evidence
1) Earliest broadcast date (parsed from text to date)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS earliest_broadcast_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito;
Result: 2010-05-10 (May 10, 2010)

2) Broadcast date of the episode with romanized title 'arienai kisu' (parsed)
SQL:
SELECT TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS broadcast_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE "romanized title" = 'arienai kisu';
Result: 2010-05-17 (May 17, 2010)

3) Day difference between 'arienai kisu' and the earliest broadcast date
SQL:
SELECT (TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') -
        (SELECT MIN(TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'))
         FROM tsuki_no_koibito)) AS day_difference
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
WHERE "romanized title" = 'arienai kisu';
Result: 7 days

4) (Corroboration) Episode with the earliest broadcast date
SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "romanized title", TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC
LIMIT 1;
Result: episode title: おまえが欲しい; romanized title: omae ga hosii; parsed_date: 2010-05-10

Conclusion

- “arienai kisu” aired on May 17, 2010.
