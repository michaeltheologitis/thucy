Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Brandon Backe was the losing pitcher in a game where the winning pitcher was Roy Oswalt.

Data source explored: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season (Texas Rangers 2005 game log). This table includes fields for date, location, winning pitcher, losing pitcher, score, and winning team.

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to confirm relevant fields and see occurrences of Roy Oswalt and Brandon Backe.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 10;
Key returned rows (subset shown by the tool):
- May 20 (Arlington): Losing pitcher = Brandon Backe; Winning pitcher = Kenny Rogers; Winning team = Texas
- May 22 (Arlington): Losing pitcher = Roy Oswalt; Winning pitcher = Chan Ho Park; Winning team = Texas
- June 24 (Houston): Losing pitcher = Ricardo Rodríguez; Winning pitcher = Roy Oswalt; Winning team = Houston
- June 25 (Houston): Losing pitcher = Brandon Backe; Winning pitcher = Chris Young; Winning team = Texas

Step 2: Directly test the claim by searching for games where the winning pitcher is Roy Oswalt and the losing pitcher is Brandon Backe.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, score, "winning team", "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher" 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE lower("winning pitcher") = 'roy oswalt' AND lower("losing pitcher") = 'brandon backe';
Result: No rows returned.

Step 3: Corroborate by listing all instances where Roy Oswalt was the winning pitcher.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, score, "winning team", "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher" 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE lower("winning pitcher") = 'roy oswalt';
Result:
- June 24 (Houston): Winning pitcher = Roy Oswalt; Losing pitcher = Ricardo Rodríguez; Winning team = Houston

Step 4: Corroborate by listing all instances where Brandon Backe was the losing pitcher.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, score, "winning team", "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher" 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE lower("losing pitcher") = 'brandon backe';
Results:
- May 20 (Arlington): Winning pitcher = Kenny Rogers; Losing pitcher = Brandon Backe; Winning team = Texas
- June 25 (Houston): Winning pitcher = Chris Young; Losing pitcher = Brandon Backe; Winning team = Texas

Conclusion:
Within the available authoritative dataset (Texas Rangers 2005 season), there are no games where Roy Oswalt was the winning pitcher and Brandon Backe was the losing pitcher. Instances of each occur separately but never together as win/loss counterparts.

Assumptions made:
- The claim is evaluated against the accessible dataset (public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season). No other data sources were available for cross-season or league-wide verification.
- Name matching is performed case-insensitively on the provided pitcher name fields.
