Claim: “the sweet dream episode happen later in the series than the witchfinder.”

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table merlin_series_2 (BBC Merlin Series 2 episodes).

Schema inspection (public.merlin_series_2):
- Columns: "no overall" (bigint), "no for series" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "uk viewers (million)" (double precision).

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, "no for series", "no overall" FROM public.merlin_series_2 WHERE LOWER(title) IN (LOWER('Sweet Dreams'), LOWER('The Witchfinder'));
- Results:
  • Title: The Witchfinder | No for Series: 7 | No Overall: 20
  • Title: Sweet Dreams | No for Series: 10 | No Overall: 23

Analysis:
- Within Merlin Series 2, “Sweet Dreams” is episode 10 and “The Witchfinder” is episode 7. Therefore, “Sweet Dreams” occurs later in the series than “The Witchfinder.”

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “sweet dream” refers to the Merlin Series 2 episode titled “Sweet Dreams.”
- “witchfinder” refers to the Merlin Series 2 episode titled “The Witchfinder.”
- “later in the series” is interpreted as a higher value of the "no for series" field (episode number within the series).
