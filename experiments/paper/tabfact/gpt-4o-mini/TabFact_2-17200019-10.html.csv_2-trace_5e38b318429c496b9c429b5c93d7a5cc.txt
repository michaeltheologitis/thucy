Claim to verify: “Of the 4 players who play in the Belgian Cup, Jonathan Legear scored more goals than the other players combined.”

Data sources discovered
- A single authoritative PostgreSQL table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season. It contains player-level season totals for R.S.C. Anderlecht (2008–09) with columns: player, league, title playoff, super cup, total.

Schema inspection
- Columns (from schema tool): player (text), league (bigint), title playoff (bigint), super cup (bigint), total (bigint).
- Note: There is no explicit column for Belgian Cup goals or appearances in this table.

What the data shows
1) Sample rows (to understand values and the presence/absence of a Belgian Cup column)
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt includes (player, league, title playoff, super cup, total):
- mbark boussoufa: 11, 0, 0, 11
- tom de sutter: 9, 0, 0, 9
- guillaume gillet: 8, 0, 0, 9
- marcin wasilewski: 8, 0, 0, 8
- jonathan legear: 5, 1, 0, 7
- ...
Observation: No explicit Belgian Cup column is present. The “total” is not always equal to (league + title playoff + super cup), implying there are goals in other competitions not broken out by a dedicated column.

2) Jonathan Legear’s row
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE player = 'jonathan legear';
Result: player=jonathan legear, league=5, title playoff=1, super cup=0, total=7.

3) Proxy calculation for “other_goals” (i.e., goals not in league, title playoff, or super cup)
SQL: SELECT player, (total - league - "title playoff" - "super cup") AS other_goals FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE (total - league - "title playoff" - "super cup") > 0 ORDER BY other_goals DESC;
Result (players with other_goals > 0):
- guillaume gillet: 1
- jonathan legear: 1
- lucas biglia: 1
- jan polák: 1
- matías suárez: 1
- hernán losada: 1
- nemanja rnić: 1

4) Count and sum of these “other_goals”
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE (total - league - "title playoff" - "super cup") > 0;
Result: 7 players
SQL: SELECT SUM(total - league - "title playoff" - "super cup") AS total_other_goals FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;
Result: 7

Assessment against the claim
- The available data does not isolate Belgian Cup statistics. Therefore, the claim cannot be directly verified from a dedicated Belgian Cup column or table.
- Using a reasonable proxy (other_goals = goals not in league, title playoff, or super cup, potentially including Belgian Cup goals), we find:
  - There are 7 players with other_goals > 0, not 4.
  - Jonathan Legear has other_goals = 1.
  - The combined other_goals of all other players is 6 (7 total minus Legear’s 1).
  - Thus, even under this proxy, Legear does not have more goals than the others combined.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. The dataset lacks a Belgian Cup-specific field, and the best available proxy analysis contradicts the statement (both on the count of players and on Legear’s tally vs. the rest combined).

Assumptions (for proxy analysis only)
- Because no Belgian Cup column exists, “other_goals” was treated as goals scored in competitions other than league, title playoff, and super cup; this could include Belgian Cup and possibly other competitions. Even under this assumption, the claim does not hold.
