Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify all World Cup matches in the dataset and order them chronologically
- SQL: SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report 
FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football 
WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result rows (ordered by date):
  - 1998 - 06 - 12 | Stade de la Mosson, Montpellier, France | 0 - 0 | World Cup | report
  - 1998 - 06 - 19 | Stade Geoffroy - Guichard, Saint - Étienne, France | 0 - 0 | World Cup | report

  - 1998 - 06 - 28 | Stade Félix Bollaert, Lens, France | 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet) | World Cup | report

2) Extract the first (earliest) World Cup match in France and verify the score
- SQL: SELECT date, venue, score, comp 
FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football 
WHERE comp ILIKE '%World Cup%' 
ORDER BY date ASC 
LIMIT 1;
- Result: Date: 1998 - 06 - 12; Venue: Stade de la Mosson, Montpellier, France; Score: 0 - 0; Competition: World Cup

Interpretation
- The earliest World Cup match in France present in this dataset (which covers Paraguay’s 1998 football year) is on 1998-06-12 in Montpellier, France, with a score of 0 - 0. Therefore, neither team scored in that first game.

Assumptions
- “First game of the World Cup in France” is interpreted within the scope of the available data source (1998 in Paraguayan football) as Paraguay’s first match of the 1998 FIFA World Cup hosted in France. 
- “Neither team score” is interpreted as a 0 - 0 draw.
