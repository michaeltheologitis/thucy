Summary conclusion
- The claim that the highest scoring game of the season was against the Angels on September 8 with a final score of 12 - 10 is supported in that: (a) there was a Blue Jays game on September 8 vs. the Angels with a final score of 12 - 10, and (b) 12 runs is the maximum number of runs the Blue Jays scored in any single game in the season. However, that maximum (12 runs) was achieved in at least one additional game (September 27 vs. the Red Sox), so the September 8 game was not uniquely the highest scoring by the Blue Jays.

Evidence from data and executed SQL
1) Data source discovery: list of available tables
- Result: The table public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season exists.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT table_catalog, table_schema, table_name, table_type FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog');

2) Table schema (columns and types)
- Result: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 't_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season';

3) Sample rows (to confirm data formatting and presence of Sept 8 vs Angels)
- Result (subset shown in tool output): includes a row for September 8 vs Angels with score 12 - 10.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 10;

4) All games vs Angels (to directly confirm the Sept 8 game and score)
- Result:
  - Date: September 8, Opponent: Angels, Score: 12 - 10
  - Date: September 9, Opponent: Angels, Score: 2 - 0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%angel%'

5) Maximum Blue Jays runs in any game and matching games
- Result: Max Blue Jays runs in a game = 12. Games with 12 runs:
  - September 8 vs Angels, Score: 12 - 10
  - September 27 vs Red Sox, Score: 12 - 5
- Executed SQL (two steps):
1) Get the maximum runs scored by the Blue Jays:
SELECT MAX( CAST(REPLACE(SPLIT_PART(score,'-',1),' ','') AS int) ) AS max_jays_runs FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season;
2) List games where the Blue Jays scored that maximum:
SELECT date, opponent, score FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE CAST(REPLACE(SPLIT_PART(score,'-',1),' ','') AS int) = (SELECT MAX( CAST(REPLACE(SPLIT_PART(score,'-',1),' ','') AS int) ) FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season) ORDER BY date;

Assessment
- The September 8 game vs Angels with final score 12 - 10 is directly confirmed by the dataset.
- The Blue Jays’ highest runs scored in any single game during the season was 12, which occurred on September 8 (vs Angels) and also on September 27 (vs Red Sox). Hence, the September 8 game is a highest-scoring game for the Blue Jays, but it is not the only one.
- Because the claim states “the highest scoring game of the season be against the angel on september 8 final score be 12 - 10” without acknowledging the tie for highest Blue Jays runs, the statement is directionally correct but incomplete about uniqueness.

Assumptions
- “The season” refers to the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season represented in the available table public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season.
- “Highest scoring game” is interpreted as the game(s) in which the Blue Jays scored their maximum runs in a single game, not necessarily the highest combined runs between both teams. (The available evidence confirms the Blue Jays’ maximum at 12 runs; we did not compute the season’s maximum combined runs across all games.)
