Claim to verify: “the party with 21 total member have 18 more member than the party with the fewest total member.”

Summary of findings:
- There exists a party with total = 21: Fianna Fáil.
- The fewest total among actual parties is 3: Clann na Talmhan.
- Difference: 21 − 3 = 18. The claim holds.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the party with total = 21
SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE total = 21;
Result:
- party: Fianna Fáil, total: 21

2) List all parties and totals to show the distribution (and to confirm the presence of 21 and the minimum)
SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad ORDER BY total ASC;
Result (ordered by total):
- Clann na Talmhan — 3
- Labour Party — 8
- Fine Gael — 9
- Independent — 9
- Fianna Fáil — 21
- Total — 60

3) Compute the minimum total among actual parties (excluding the summary row ‘Total’) and list the party with that minimum
SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party != 'Total' ORDER BY total ASC LIMIT 1;
Result:
- party: Clann na Talmhan, total: 3

SQL:
SELECT party FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE total = (SELECT MIN(total) FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party != 'Total');
Result:
- party: Clann na Talmhan

4) Compute the difference between 21 and the minimum total (excluding ‘Total’)
SQL:
SELECT 21 - MIN(total) AS difference FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party != 'Total';
Result:
- difference: 18

Conclusion: The party with 21 total members (Fianna Fáil) has 18 more members than the party with the fewest total members (Clann na Talmhan with 3). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “party with the fewest total member” refers to the party row with the minimum value in the ‘total’ column, excluding the summary row labeled ‘Total’.
- Minor grammatical issues in the claim are interpreted as: “The party with 21 total members has 18 more members than the party with the fewest total members.”
