Summary
- Data source discovered: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games (PostgreSQL), which tracks nation-level medal counts in Wushu at the Asian Games.
- Goal: Verify whether Hong Kong has 4 more bronze medals than Thailand in Wushu.

Schema checked
- Table: wushu_at_the_asian_games
  - Columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence
1) Executed SQL
SELECT nation, bronze FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY nation ASC;

Returned (relevant rows excerpt)
- hong kong (hkg) | 4
- thailand (tha)  | 6
(Note: The full result included multiple other nations and a summary row labeled "total".)

Analysis
- Hong Kong bronze medals: 4
- Thailand bronze medals: 6
- Difference (Hong Kong − Thailand): 4 − 6 = −2
Conclusion: Hong Kong has 2 fewer bronze medals than Thailand (not 4 more) in Wushu at the Asian Games per the table.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. The data indicates the opposite relationship.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to cumulative Wushu medals at the Asian Games (the scope of the available dataset). If the claim intended a different competition (e.g., World Wushu Championships, SEA Games, a specific year), results could differ. We mapped “Hong Kong” to the row labeled “hong kong (hkg)” and “Thailand” to “thailand (tha)”. We ignored the “total” summary row for nation-to-nation comparison.
