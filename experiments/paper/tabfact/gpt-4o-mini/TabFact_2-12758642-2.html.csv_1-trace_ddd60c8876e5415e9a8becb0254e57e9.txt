Summary:
- I explored the available database and found one relevant table: public.katsuya_inoue, which records Katsuya Inoue’s fight history (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location).
- I queried this table for the event “GCM - DOG 4” to verify who the opponent was at that event.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Query
SELECT * FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE LOWER(event) = LOWER('GCM - DOG 4');

Result row
- Result: Win
- Record: 11 - 3
- Opponent: Daisuke Hanazawa
- Method: Decision (Majority)
- Event: gcm - dog 4
- Round: 3
- Time: 5:00
- Location: Tokyo, Japan

Conclusion:
- The data shows that at the event GCM - DOG 4, the opponent was Daisuke Hanazawa. This supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to Katsuya Inoue’s bout at GCM - DOG 4, as the only available dataset pertains to his fight record.
