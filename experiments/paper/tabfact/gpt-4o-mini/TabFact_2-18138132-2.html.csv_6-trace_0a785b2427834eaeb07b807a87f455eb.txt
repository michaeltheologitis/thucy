Claim to verify: "twitter have the version of 1.0.0.3"

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, schema public, with table list_of_zune_applications (Zune applications catalog).
- Table structure (from schema inspection): columns: title (text), developer (text), category (text), release date (text), version (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Exact match for title = 'Twitter' and version = '1.0.0.3'
SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
WHERE title = 'Twitter' AND version = '1.0.0.3';
Result: 0 rows (no matching records).

2) Case-insensitive search for titles containing 'twitter' and version exactly '1.0.0.3' (ignoring leading/trailing spaces)
SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
FROM list_of_zune_applications
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%twitter%'
AND TRIM(version) = '1.0.0.3';
Result: 0 rows (no matching records).

3) List all entries containing 'Twitter' to see available versions
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT title, version, developer, "release date"
FROM list_of_zune_applications
WHERE title ILIKE '%Twitter%';
Result:
- title: twitter; version: 1.6; developer: matchbox; release date: 2010-12-16

Conclusion:
- Within the authoritative Zune applications catalog available to us, there is no record of a Twitter app with version 1.0.0.3. The only Twitter-related entry found has version 1.6. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data we have.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "twitter" as the app title within the Zune applications database (the only available data source).
- Interpreted "version of 1.0.0.3" as the application version string. Other platforms or stores are outside the scope of the accessible dataset.
