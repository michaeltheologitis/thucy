Claim to verify: "217 be the lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville."

Summary conclusion: The data shows the lowest (minimum) "1st lbsc no" for locomotives named "Granville" is 216, not 217. Additionally, the record with "1st lbsc no" = 217 has the LBSC name "northcote", not "granville".

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public
- Table: list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives

Schema used:
- Columns: "1st lbsc no" (bigint), "lbsc name" (text), "built" (bigint), "2nd lbsc no" (text), "1st sr no" (text), "2ns sr no" (text), "withdrawn" (bigint)

Evidence 1: List of entries named Granville (case-insensitive)
Result:
- 1st lbsc no: 216; lbsc name: granville; built: 1883; 2nd lbsc no: -; 1st sr no: -; 2ns sr no: -; withdrawn: 1911
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives WHERE LOWER("lbsc name") = LOWER('Granville')

Evidence 2: Minimum "1st lbsc no" among entries named Granville
Result: 216
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN("1st lbsc no") AS min_lbsc_no
FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives
WHERE LOWER("lbsc name") = LOWER('Granville');

Evidence 3: Cross-check entries with 1st lbsc no 216 and 217
Result:
- 216 -> lbsc name: granville
- 217 -> lbsc name: northcote
Executed SQL:
SELECT "1st lbsc no", "lbsc name" FROM public.list_of_lb_scr_b1_class_locomotives WHERE "1st lbsc no" IN (216, 217);

Assessment:
- The lowest (minimum) 1st LBSC number associated with the LBSC name "Granville" in this dataset is 216. Therefore, the claim that 217 is the lowest is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "lowest 1st lbsc number with a lbsc name of granville" as the minimum value of the column "1st lbsc no" among rows where the column "lbsc name" equals "Granville" (case-insensitive) in the provided dataset.
