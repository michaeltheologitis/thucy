Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: t_1988_winter_olympics (columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total). This table records medal counts by nation for the 1988 Winter Olympics.

Step 1: Check how many nations share the same bronze medal count
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT bronze, COUNT(nation) AS nation_count
  FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics
  GROUP BY bronze
  ORDER BY COUNT(nation) DESC, bronze ASC;
- Result (relevant excerpt):
  - 2 bronze medals: 6 nations
  - 3 bronze medals: 2 nations
  - 5 bronze medals: 1 nation
  - 6 bronze medals: 1 nation
  - 9 bronze medals: 1 nation
- Interpretation: There exists a bronze medal count (2) that is shared by 6 different nations.

Step 2: Identify the nations with exactly 2 bronze medals and confirm the count
- Executed SQL (list nations):
  SELECT nation
  FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics
  WHERE bronze = 2;
- Executed SQL (count them):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS nation_count
  FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics
  WHERE bronze = 2;
- Result: 6 nations with exactly 2 bronze medals: Finland (FIN), Sweden (SWE), Austria (AUT), Netherlands (NED), West Germany (FRG), Italy (ITA).

Conclusion:
- The evidence shows that, in the 1988 Winter Olympics dataset, 6 different countries received the same number of bronze medals (specifically, 2 each). This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1988 Winter Olympics medal data, as this is the available authoritative data source.
