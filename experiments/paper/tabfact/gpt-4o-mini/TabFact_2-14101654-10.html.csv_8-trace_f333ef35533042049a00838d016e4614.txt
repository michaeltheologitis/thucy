Claim evaluated: “2 players were drafted in each of rounds 3 and 9.”

Data source consulted: public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season (player-level records including a draft round field: round, player, position, nationality, college/junior/club team (league)).

Evidence 1 — Count of players by round (3 and 9)
SQL executed:
SELECT round, COUNT(player) AS player_count
FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
WHERE round = 3 OR round = 9
GROUP BY round;

Result:
- Round 3: 1 player
- Round 9: 2 players

Evidence 2 — Exact rows for rounds 3 and 9
SQL executed:
SELECT round, player, position, "college / junior / club team (league)" AS team
FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
WHERE round IN (3, 9)
ORDER BY round, player;

Result rows:
- Round 3: Rob Bellamy — Right Wing — New England Jr Coyotes (EJHL)
- Round 9: John Carter — Center — Brewster Bulldogs (EMJHL)
- Round 9: Triston Grant — Left Wing — Vancouver Giants (WHL)

Conclusion: The data shows 1 player in round 3 and 2 players in round 9. Therefore, the claim that “2 players were drafted in each of rounds 3 and 9” is not supported (true for round 9, false for round 3).

Assumptions made:
- “Players drafted in round X” refers to the entries in the provided table, which appears to record drafted players for the relevant season/draft context of the Philadelphia Flyers.
- The table comprehensively lists players for the rounds it contains.
