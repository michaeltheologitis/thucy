Summary conclusion
- Verified: In the 1927 VFL season data, there is a match where the home team is Carlton, the away team is St Kilda, and the venue is Princes Park. Note: The stadium’s correct name is “Princes Park” (not “Princess Park”). 

Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table: public.t_1927_vfl_season (1927 VFL season matches).
- Relevant columns: "home team", "away team", "venue", "date", "home team score", "away team score", "crowd".

Evidence from executed SQL
- Purpose: Check for any match where home team = Carlton, away team = St Kilda, and venue contains Princes Park.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season WHERE lower("home team") = 'carlton' AND lower("away team") = 'st kilda' AND lower("venue") LIKE '%princes park%'
- Result returned (single row):
  - home team: carlton
  - home team score: 15.16 (106)
  - away team: st kilda
  - away team score: 7.9 (51)
  - venue: princes park
  - crowd: 24000
  - date: 10 september 1927

Assessment of each part of the claim
- Home team Carlton: Supported by the returned row.
- Away team St Kilda: Supported by the returned row.
- Venue at Princes Park: Supported by the returned row (note: spelled “Princes Park” in the dataset).

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the 1927 VFL season data and is accurate within this dataset.

Assumptions
- Scope: The verification is grounded in the available 1927 VFL season dataset. If the claim intended a different season or a general historical statement beyond 1927, this verification only confirms that such a match did occur in 1927.
