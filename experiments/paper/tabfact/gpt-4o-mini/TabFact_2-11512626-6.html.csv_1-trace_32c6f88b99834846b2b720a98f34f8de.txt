Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (1997 Colorado Rockies season game logs).

Schema overview (key fields)
- date (text): date of the game
- attendance (bigint): number of attendees
- Other columns: opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), record (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify all games with attendance < 20000 and list their dates
SQL executed:
SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE attendance < 20000 ORDER BY date;
Results:
- Date: August 4, Attendance: 15,230
- Date: August 5, Attendance: 16,428

2) Count how many such games occurred
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE attendance < 20000;
Result:
- game_count: 2

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly two games with attendance less than 20,000, and they occurred on August 4 and August 5 (in the context of the 1997 season).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1997 Colorado Rockies season dataset represented by public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season.
- Dates shown as “August 4” and “August 5” correspond to those dates within the 1997 season (year not stored in the date text field).
- “Less than 20000” is interpreted as strictly < 20000.
