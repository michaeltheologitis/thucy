Conclusion:
- Within the available dataset (TabFact → public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season), the player with the highest number of total goals is Ian Robins with 27 goals. The claim that it is “ian robin” is essentially correct but has a minor misspelling; the correct surname is “Robins.”

Evidence from data:
- Data source: Database TabFact, schema public, table t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (columns include: name, position, league goals, fa cup goals, league cup goals, total goals, etc.).

Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL used to identify the top total goal scorer by summing goals across competitions:
SELECT name, (COALESCE("league goals", 0) + COALESCE("fa cup goals", 0) + COALESCE("league cup goals", 0)) AS total_goals 
FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season 
ORDER BY total_goals DESC 
LIMIT 1;

Result: name = Ian Robins, total_goals = 27

Assessment of the claim:
- The data shows the top scorer is “Ian Robins,” not “Ian Robin.” This appears to be a minor spelling error. Substantively, the claim correctly identifies the top scorer (subject to spelling).

Assumptions made:
- Scope: Interpreted “the player with the highest number of total goal” as referring to the only available dataset: Huddersfield Town F.C. 1979–80 season in the TabFact database.
- Ties: The query returns the first-ranked player; no tie-handling was explicitly performed, but none was indicated by the returned result.
- Name interpretation: Treated “ian robin” as a misspelling of “Ian Robins.”
