Summary
- Claim assessed: Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points in only 1 game during a specific period of the 2010–2011 season.
- Interpreted period: March 1–March 11, 2011 (games 62–66), as reflected by the contiguous set of rows in the dataset around that timeframe. Within these games, Stuckey appears as the high points leader exactly once.

Data source discovery and structure
- Available table: t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season

Executed SQL to confirm table and schema
1) List tables
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

2) Columns for the table
SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season';

Result (relevant columns): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), "high points" (text), "high rebounds" (text), "high assists" (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text)

Evidence for the interpreted period (March 1–11, 2011)
A) List all games on March 1, March 2, March 6, March 9, and March 11 with high points leaders
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "high points"
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE date IN ('march 1','march 2','march 6','march 9','march 11')
ORDER BY game;

Result snapshot:
- Game 62 | March 1 | Opponent: Milwaukee | Score: L 90 - 92 (OT) | High Points: Rodney Stuckey (25)
- Game 63 | March 2 | Opponent: Minnesota | Score: L 105 - 116 (OT) | High Points: Austin Daye (22)
- Game 64 | March 6 | Opponent: Washington | Score: W 113 - 102 (OT) | High Points: Tayshaun Prince (20)
- Game 65 | March 9 | Opponent: San Antonio | Score: L 104 - 111 (OT) | High Points: Richard Hamilton (20)
- Game 66 | March 11 | Opponent: Oklahoma City | Score: L 94 - 104 (OT) | High Points: Richard Hamilton (20)

B) Count how many of those games list Rodney Stuckey as the high points leader
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE date IN ('march 1','march 2','march 6','march 9','march 11')
AND "high points" ILIKE '%rodney stuckey%';

Result: 1

Conclusion
- Within the period March 1–March 11, 2011 (games 62–66), Rodney Stuckey led the Detroit Pistons in points in exactly 1 game (March 1, Game 62). The data supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions
- "This period" refers to March 1–11, 2011 (games 62–66), inferred from contiguous entries in the available dataset around early March.
- "Lead the Detroit Pistons in point core" is interpreted as "led the team in points scored" based on the "high points" field. If a different period was intended, results may differ.
