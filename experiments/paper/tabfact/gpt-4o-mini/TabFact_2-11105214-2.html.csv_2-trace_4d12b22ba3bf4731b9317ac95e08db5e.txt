Claim to verify: “Galloway & Upper Nithsdale winning party in 2003 is Conservative, while Paisley South’s is Labour.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered a public table: scottish_parliament_general_election_2007. The schema includes a column explicitly labeled “winning party 2003,” which allows verification of 2003 winners by constituency.
- Relevant columns: rank; constituency; "winning party 2003"; "swing to gain"; "snp 's place 2003"; result.

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT constituency, "winning party 2003"
FROM scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
WHERE LOWER(constituency) LIKE '%galloway%' OR LOWER(constituency) LIKE '%paisley%';

- Returned rows:
  • Constituency: Galloway & Upper Nithsdale — Winning Party 2003: Conservative
  • Constituency: Paisley South — Winning Party 2003: Labour

Conclusion:
- The data shows that in 2003, Galloway & Upper Nithsdale’s winning party was Conservative, and Paisley South’s winning party was Labour. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “win party 2003” is interpreted as the constituency-winning party in the 2003 Scottish Parliament election. The constituency names are matched case-insensitively and by substring (handling the ampersand).
