Claim: “All new episodes of Gary Unmarried Season 1 air on Wednesday at 8:30 PM.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.gary_unmarried.
- Schema (from data source):
  - episode (text), air date (text), timeslot (text), 18 - 49 (text), viewers (double precision).

What I checked
- Whether all recorded Season 1 episodes share the same timeslot and day.
- The total episode count and distinct timeslots present in the data.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) List all entries with their timeslot
SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot FROM gary_unmarried;
Result summary: All returned rows show timeslot = "Wednesday 8:30 PM". The rows (20) include:

2) Count total episodes
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM gary_unmarried;
Result: 20 episodes.

3) Distinct timeslots with counts
SQL:
SELECT timeslot, COUNT(episode) AS episode_count FROM gary_unmarried GROUP BY timeslot;
Result: Wednesday 8:30 PM — 20 episodes.

Conclusion
- All 20 recorded Season 1 episodes in the dataset aired in the same timeslot, Wednesday at 8:30 PM. This supports the claim that the “all new” (i.e., first-run) Season 1 episodes aired on Wednesday at 8:30 PM.

Assumptions
- The table gary_unmarried contains the original (first-run) airings for Season 1 and not reruns.
- “All new” refers to first-run broadcasts, which is consistent with how episode airings are typically recorded in such datasets.
