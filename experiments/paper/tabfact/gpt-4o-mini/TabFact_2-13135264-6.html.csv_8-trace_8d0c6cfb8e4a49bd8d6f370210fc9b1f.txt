Claim to verify: “the low attendance rate of 20066 occur multiple time”

What the data shows
- Frequency of attendance 20,066 and dataset size
  • Result: Attendance = 20,066 occurs 7 times; there are 14 games total; 8 distinct attendance figures.
  • SQL (count of games with attendance = 20066):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_with_attendance_20066 
    FROM t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season 
    WHERE attendance = 20066;
  • SQL (total games and distinct attendance values):
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games, COUNT(DISTINCT attendance) AS distinct_attendance_count 
    FROM t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;

- Whether 20,066 is “low” relative to the dataset
  • Result: Minimum attendance = 17,053; Maximum attendance = 20,066; Average attendance = 18,949.
  • Interpretation: 20,066 is the maximum attendance observed in the dataset, not a low value.
  • SQL:
    SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance, MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance, AVG(attendance) AS avg_attendance 
    FROM t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;

- All games with attendance = 20,066
  • Result (ordered by date):
    1) Date: January 3, Visitor: Anaheim, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    2) Date: January 5, Visitor: Nashville, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    3) Date: January 7, Visitor: Boston, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    4) Date: January 14, Visitor: Chicago, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    5) Date: January 16, Visitor: Phoenix, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    6) Date: January 29, Visitor: New Jersey, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
    7) Date: January 31, Visitor: Carolina, Home: Detroit, Attendance: 20066
  • SQL:
    SELECT date, visitor, home, attendance 
    FROM t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season 
    WHERE attendance = 20066 
    ORDER BY date;

Assessment of the claim
- “occur multiple time”: Supported. Attendance 20,066 appears 7 times.
- “low attendance rate”: Not supported. In this dataset, 20,066 is the maximum attendance, not low.

Conclusion: The claim mixes a correct observation (multiple occurrences) with an incorrect characterization (calling 20,066 “low”).

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “attendance rate of 20066” as the raw attendance count value 20,066 in the attendance column of t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season.
- Interpreted “occur multiple time” as appearing in more than one game within this dataset.
- Conclusions are limited to the available data in t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
