Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the Chicago Bears defeated the Detroit Lions in both games they played (implying a season sweep of the head-to-head matchups).

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season containing Detroit Lions’ 1976 game results.
- Retrieved the schema and queried games versus the Chicago Bears.

Evidence from data:
- Query: List 1976 Detroit Lions games against the Chicago Bears.
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result 
FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Bears%'

Query result (verbatim):
- Week 1 | September 12, 1976 | Chicago Bears | L 10 - 3
- Week 11 | November 21, 1976 | Chicago Bears | W 14 - 10

Analysis:
- In 1976, the Lions and Bears split their two games. Detroit lost the first meeting (L 10–3) and won the second (W 14–10). Therefore, the Chicago Bears did not defeat the Lions in both games they played that season.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available authoritative data (1976 season), the claim is contradicted.

Assumptions:
- The only accessible dataset covers the 1976 Detroit Lions season. I interpret the claim in the context of this season due to data availability. If the claim referred to a different season, it cannot be assessed with the provided data sources.
