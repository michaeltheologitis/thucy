Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that, in 2011, the value for the “reader's vote” field is N/A (i.e., not available) in the Ned Kelly Awards data.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: Ned Kelly Awards (public schema)
- Table: ned_kelly_awards
- Relevant column: "reader 's vote"

Evidence retrieved:
- Result: For year 2011, the value in the "reader 's vote" column is "na".
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "reader \'s vote" FROM ned_kelly_awards WHERE year = 2011;

Assessment:
- The dataset records the value as "na" (without the slash), which conveys the same meaning as "n/a" (not available). The core claim that the reader’s vote was not available for 2011 is supported by the data, with only a minor formatting difference.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "n / a" is interpreted as the common abbreviation "n/a" meaning not available.
- The claim refers to the "reader 's vote" column in the Ned Kelly Awards dataset for the year 2011.
