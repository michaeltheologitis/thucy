Objective
Assess the claim: "week 9 be before October 30, 1983" using available, authoritative data.

Data discovery and structure
- Data source discovered: Database TabFact, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Step 1: Inspect date format
Result:
- Week 1: September 4, 1983
- Week 2: September 11, 1983
- Week 3: September 18, 1983
- Week 4: September 25, 1983
- Week 5: October 2, 1983
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season LIMIT 5;

Step 2: Retrieve Week 9 date
Result:
- Week: 9
- Date: October 30, 1983
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE week = 9;

Step 3: Context around Week 9
Result:
- Week 8: October 23, 1983
- Week 9: October 30, 1983
- Week 10: November 7, 1983
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE week BETWEEN 8 AND 10;

Conclusion
- The data shows Week 9 occurred on October 30, 1983, not before that date. Therefore, the claim that "week 9 be before October 30, 1983" is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "Week 9" is interpreted as the 1983 Detroit Lions’ Week 9 (NFL season context) since that is the available authoritative dataset.
- "Before" is interpreted as strictly earlier than October 30, 1983 (not on or after).
