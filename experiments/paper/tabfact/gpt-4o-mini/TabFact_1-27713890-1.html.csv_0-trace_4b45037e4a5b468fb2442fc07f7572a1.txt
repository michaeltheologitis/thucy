Claim: “The One Where Everybody Finds Out” is episode number 111.0.

Data source discovery:
- Available PostgreSQL database with table public.friends_season_5 containing Friends Season 5 episode data. Relevant columns include: "no in series" (overall episode number), "no in season", title, "original air date", "production code", and more.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Locate the episode by title (case-insensitive search):
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title FROM public.friends_season_5 WHERE title ILIKE '%Everybody Finds Out%';
Result:
- no in series: 111
- no in season: 14
- title: the one where everybody finds out

2) Cross-check by overall episode number:
SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title FROM public.friends_season_5 WHERE "no in series" = 111;
Result:
- no in series: 111
- no in season: 14
- title: The One Where Everybody Finds Out

Conclusion:
- The dataset identifies “The One Where Everybody Finds Out” as overall episode number 111. The claim’s “111.0” is numerically equivalent to 111, so the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Episode number” refers to the overall series episode number (column "no in series"), not the season episode number. The table represents authoritative data for Friends Season 5 episodes.
