Summary
- Claim evaluated: “there be a total of 5 country represent by the player.” Interpreted as: The players in the available dataset represent 5 distinct countries.
- Result: The data shows 4 distinct countries represented by the players, not 5.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf (1989 U.S. Open Golf players/results).

Step 1: Inspect table schema
Purpose: Confirm relevant fields (player and country) exist.
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1989_u_s_open_golf' AND table_schema = 'public';
Result (abridged):
- place: text
- player: text
- country: text
- score: text
- to par: text
- money: bigint

Step 2: Count distinct countries and list the breakdown
Purpose: Determine how many unique non-empty countries are represented by players.
Executed SQL (count distinct countries):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT country) AS distinct_country_count
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE country IS NOT NULL AND country <> '';
Executed SQL (breakdown by country):
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS country_count
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE country IS NOT NULL AND country <> ''
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY country;
Results:
- Distinct countries: 4
- Breakdown:
  - Japan: 1
  - Spain: 1
  - United States: 9
  - Wales: 1

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. There are 4 distinct countries represented by the players in the dataset, not 5.

Assumptions
- “Player” refers to entries in the table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf.
- “Country represented by the player” is taken as the country column for each player, counting distinct non-empty values.
- Literal string comparison is used; the dataset’s country names appear consistently formatted, so no normalization was applied.
