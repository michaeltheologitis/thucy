Claim to verify: “during the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision be Backstrom 11 time more than it be Harding.”

Data source explored
- Available table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)
- The decision column contains the goaltender credited with the decision (values observed: “backstrom”, “harding”).

Evidence gathered
1) Distinct decision values and counts
SQL:
SELECT decision, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
GROUP BY decision;

Result:
- backstrom: 11
- harding: 3

2) Total number of rows
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;

Result:
- total_rows: 14

Analysis
- Backstrom decisions: 11
- Harding decisions: 3
- Difference (Backstrom − Harding): 11 − 3 = 8 (not 11)
- Ratio (Backstrom / Harding): 11 / 3 ≈ 3.67 (not 11×)

Therefore, whether the claim is interpreted as “Backstrom had 11 more decisions than Harding” or “Backstrom had 11 times as many decisions as Harding,” the data does not support it. The observed counts show an 8-decision difference and a ~3.67× ratio.

Conclusion
The claim is not supported by the data in the authoritative table for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “decision be Backstrom 11 time more than it be Harding” as either (a) Backstrom had 11 more decisions than Harding, or (b) Backstrom had 11 times as many decisions as Harding. Both interpretations are contradicted by the data.
- Treated the table public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season as a complete and authoritative record for the season per instructions.
