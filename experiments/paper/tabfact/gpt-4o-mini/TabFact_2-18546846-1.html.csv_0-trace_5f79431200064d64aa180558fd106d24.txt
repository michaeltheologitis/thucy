Summary
- Claim interpreted as: The San Francisco 49ers won 8 games in the 1947 season (AAFC).

Data source explored
- Available table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), score (text), record (text)

Evidence
1) Count games by result value
- SQL: SELECT result, COUNT(*) as game_count FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season GROUP BY result ORDER BY game_count DESC;
- Result: wins ("w") = 8, losses ("l") = 4, ties ("t") = 2

2) Directly count wins (case-insensitive check)
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS win_count FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE LOWER(TRIM(result)) = 'w';
- Result: win_count = 8

Conclusion
- The data show the 49ers recorded 8 wins in the 1947 season. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "49ers" refers to the San Francisco 49ers.
- "1947 season" refers to their 1947 AAFC season.
- "win 8 of the game" means the team won 8 games in total for that season.
