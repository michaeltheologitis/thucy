Claim interpreted: “The hometown of the player that attended UCLA is Las Vegas, NV.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table: usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team.

Relevant schema (usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team):
- player (text)
- height (text)
- school (text)
- hometown (text)
- college (text)

Evidence from data:
1) Query to find any player whose college is exactly UCLA (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT player, college, hometown 
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team 
WHERE college ILIKE 'UCLA';
Result:
- Player: Shabazz Muhammad | College: UCLA | Hometown: Las Vegas, NV

2) Broader check to include any college values containing “UCLA” (case-insensitive):
SQL:
SELECT player, college, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE college ILIKE '%UCLA%';
Result:
- Player: Shabazz Muhammad | College: UCLA | Hometown: Las Vegas, NV

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains one player associated with UCLA: Shabazz Muhammad, whose listed hometown is Las Vegas, NV. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “the player that attend ucla” refers to players within the usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team table. 
- The misspelling “las vega , nv” is interpreted as “Las Vegas, NV.”
