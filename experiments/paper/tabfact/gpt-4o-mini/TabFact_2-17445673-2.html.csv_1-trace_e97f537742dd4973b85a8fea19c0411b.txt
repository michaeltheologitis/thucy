Conclusion
Based on the only available dataset (public.tim_lajcik), there are more win results than loss results. The outcome counts are: Wins = 7, Losses = 6, Draws = 1. Therefore, the claim is supported.

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Identify available tables
- SQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: tim_lajcik

2) Preview table structure
- SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'tim_lajcik' AND table_schema = 'public';
- Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text)

3) Count outcomes (wins vs losses vs others)
- SQL: SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS outcome_count FROM public.tim_lajcik GROUP BY res;
- Result: win = 7, loss = 6, draw = 1

Interpretation
- Since 7 (wins) > 6 (losses), there are more win results than loss results in this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the outcomes recorded in the res column of the only available table (public.tim_lajcik), which appears to list fight results for Tim Lajcik.
