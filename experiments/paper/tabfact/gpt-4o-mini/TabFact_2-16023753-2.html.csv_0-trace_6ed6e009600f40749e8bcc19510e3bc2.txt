Claim: “the dolphin finish the regular season with a 12 - 4 record.”

Scope of verification: Based on the available data source, this claim is interpreted as referring to the Miami Dolphins’ 1983 NFL regular season.

What the data shows:
- The 1983 Miami Dolphins played 16 regular-season games.
- Classification of game outcomes from the season table shows 12 wins and 4 losses (0 ties).

Supporting evidence and exact executed SQL:
1) Outcome classification (wins/losses/ties) from the result field
SQL:
SELECT
    CASE
        WHEN LOWER(SUBSTRING(result FROM 1 FOR 1)) = 'w' THEN 'Win'
        WHEN LOWER(SUBSTRING(result FROM 1 FOR 1)) = 'l' THEN 'Loss'
        WHEN LOWER(SUBSTRING(result FROM 1 FOR 1)) = 't' THEN 'Tie'
        ELSE 'Unknown'
    END AS game_outcome,
    COUNT(*) AS total_count
FROM
    public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
GROUP BY
    game_outcome;
Result summary: Win = 12, Loss = 4, Tie = 0

2) Total number of regular-season games
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result: total_rows = 16

3) Cross-check of wins and losses via prefix matching
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 END) AS wins, COUNT(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 END) AS losses FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;
Result: wins = 12, losses = 4

Conclusion: The data supports that the Miami Dolphins finished the 1983 regular season with a 12–4 record.

Assumptions made:
- “the dolphin” refers to the NFL’s Miami Dolphins.
- The claim pertains to the 1983 season because the available authoritative dataset is the table public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season, which contains the 1983 season’s game results.
