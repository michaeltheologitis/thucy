Claim assessed: "brazil have transport / utility and attack type aircraft"

Summary conclusion: The accessible data sources do not contain information about Brazil’s aircraft inventory. Therefore, this claim cannot be verified using the available data.

Data sources discovered
- Available database object: public.uruguayan_air_force (PostgreSQL)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) What tables are available in the public schema?
- SQL executed: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: uruguayan_air_force

2) Are there any tables related to Brazil?
- SQL executed: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name ILIKE '%brazil%';
- Result: No rows returned (no Brazil-related tables)

3) What aircraft types exist in the only available table (Uruguayan Air Force) — for context only, not evidence about Brazil?
- SQL executed: SELECT DISTINCT type, COUNT(*) as count_per_type FROM public.uruguayan_air_force GROUP BY type;
- Result (Uruguay context):
  - transport / utility: 5
  - utility / liaison: 1
  - trainer: 3
  - liaison / transport: 1
  - attack / fighter: 1
  - vip transport: 1
  - transport: 2
  - attack: 1
  - trainer / liaison: 1

Assessment
- The only accessible dataset pertains to the Uruguayan Air Force and confirms the presence of categories like "transport / utility" and "attack" for Uruguay.
- There is no table or record in the accessible data that covers Brazil’s aircraft inventory. Consequently, the claim about Brazil cannot be substantiated from the available evidence.

Conclusion: The claim is unsupported by the accessible data and therefore cannot be verified here.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “Brazil operates (has in service) aircraft categorized as transport/utility and attack types.”
- No external sources beyond the provided database were used; conclusions are strictly based on the accessible data environment.
