Claim to verify: “the average win percentage of a season with a gb of 5 be 0.535.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
- Columns: year (text), record (text), win % (bigint), league (text), division (text), gb (text), post - season record (text), post - season win % (text), mlb affiliate (text)

Step 1: Confirm that seasons with gb = 5 exist and how many
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT gb, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE gb ~ '^\d+\.?\d*$'  -- regex to match numeric gb
GROUP BY gb;

Result (relevant portion): gb = '5' — Count: 1 (i.e., there is exactly one season with gb = 5)

Step 2: Retrieve the season(s) with gb = 5 and their win %
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "win %" FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';

Result: Year = 2010, win % = 535
Interpretation note: The column "win %" is stored as an integer representing thousandths (e.g., 535 corresponds to 0.535).

Step 3: Compute the average win percentage (normalized to decimal) for gb = 5
Executed SQL:
SELECT AVG("win %")/1000.0 AS average_win_percentage
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE gb = '5';

Result: average_win_percentage = 0.535

Conclusion
- The data show exactly one season with gb = 5, with win % recorded as 535, which corresponds to 0.535 in decimal form. Therefore, the average win percentage for seasons with gb = 5 is 0.535.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions made
- “gb” is interpreted as “games behind” in the standings, consistent with the gb column in the available dataset.
- The claim is evaluated against the accessible dataset public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons (Nashville Sounds seasons).
