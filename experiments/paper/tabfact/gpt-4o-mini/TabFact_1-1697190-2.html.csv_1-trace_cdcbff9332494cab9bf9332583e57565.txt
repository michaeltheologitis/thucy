Claim: “casey martin never win a tournament.”

Data sources explored
- Available database sources show a single relevant table: public.casey_martin, which contains yearly statistics for Casey Martin (year, tournaments played, cuts made, wins, best finish, earnings, money list rank).

Evidence from the data
1) Year-by-year wins
- SQL executed:
  SELECT year, wins, "best finish" FROM public.casey_martin ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (year – wins – best finish):
  - 1998 – 0 – t - 23
  - 2000 – 0 – t - 17
  - 2001 – 0 – cut
  - 2002 – 0 – cut
  - 2003 – 0 – cut
  - 2004 – 0 – t - 69
  - 2005 – 0 – t - 65

2) Total wins across all available years in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.casey_martin;
- Result: total_wins = 0

3) Coverage of the dataset (years present)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM public.casey_martin ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result: 1998, 2000, 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005

- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.casey_martin;
- Result: row_count = 7

Assessment
- The available dataset records Casey Martin’s yearly statistics for seven seasons (1998, 2000–2005), showing 0 wins in each of those seasons and 0 wins in total across the dataset. This supports that he did not win a tournament in the seasons covered.
- However, the claim “never win a tournament” is absolute and extends beyond the dataset’s coverage. The database does not include all possible tours or years of his career; therefore, we cannot definitively verify “never” across his entire career solely from this data.

Conclusion
- Based on the dataset, Casey Martin recorded 0 wins in the seasons available (1998, 2000–2005). This partially supports the claim, but the data does not conclusively establish that he never won any tournament outside these seasons.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “tournament” as an official professional tournament as tracked by the available casey_martin yearly statistics table.
- Acknowledged that the dataset may not encompass all tours or all years of Casey Martin’s playing career; conclusions are limited to what is represented in the database.
