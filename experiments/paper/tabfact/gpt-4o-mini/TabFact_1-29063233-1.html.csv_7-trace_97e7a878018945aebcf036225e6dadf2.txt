Conclusion
- The episode “The Lady of the Lake” had 6.30 million UK viewers and is not the least-viewed episode in the Merlin Series 2 dataset. The least-viewed episode is “Beauty and the Beast (Part 1)” with 5.53 million viewers. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Merlin Series 2 episode titled “The Lady of the Lake,” which matches the available dataset. If the claim intended a different series or a different “Lady of the Lake” episode from another show, that data is not present in the accessible sources, and conclusions are limited to Merlin Series 2.
