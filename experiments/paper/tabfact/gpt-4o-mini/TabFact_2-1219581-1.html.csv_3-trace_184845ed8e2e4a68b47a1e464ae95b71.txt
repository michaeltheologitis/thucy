Summary
- Claim: “the zakspeed 861 chassis be make in the year 1986 and 1987.”
- Finding: The available data shows the Zakspeed 861 chassis is listed for both 1986 and 1987, indicating it was part of Zakspeed’s F1 entry in both seasons (with 1987 also listing the newer 871 alongside it).

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a table named zakspeed.

Schema details consulted
- Table: public.zakspeed
  - Columns: year (bigint), chassis (text), engine (s) (text), tyres (text), points (bigint)
  - No primary keys or constraints reported.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify years where the chassis mentions “861”
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT year, chassis FROM public.zakspeed WHERE chassis ILIKE '%861%';
Results:
- 1986 | zakspeed 861
- 1987 | zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871

2) Retrieve full rows for 1986 and 1987 for context
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.zakspeed WHERE year IN (1986, 1987);
Results:
- 1986 | chassis: zakspeed 861 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c | tyres: g | points: 0
- 1987 | chassis: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871 | engine (s): zakspeed s4 t / c | tyres: g | points: 2

Conclusion
- The data explicitly lists “zakspeed 861” in 1986 and again in 1987 (alongside “zakspeed 871” in 1987). This supports the claim that the Zakspeed 861 chassis was present in both 1986 and 1987.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be make” to mean the 861 chassis model was part of Zakspeed’s F1 program/used in competition in those years. The table records usage by year, which is taken as evidence of presence/availability of the chassis in those seasons.
