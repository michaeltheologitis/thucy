Claim: “none of the athlete receive a medal for pommel horse.”

Finding: The data shows at least one athlete associated with a pommel horse medal event, contradicting the claim.

Evidence from the database:
1) Retrieve rows mentioning pommel horse
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists WHERE sport ILIKE '%pommel%' OR "record medal event" ILIKE '%pommel%'
- Result (excerpt):
  • Athlete: Hermann Weingärtner | Date: 9 April 1896 | Medal Count: 4 | Nation: Germany | Sport: Gymnastics | Record Medal Event: Pommel Horse S

2) List all athletes and details where record medal event mentions pommel
- Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, nation, date, "medal count", sport, "record medal event" 
FROM list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists 
WHERE "record medal event" ILIKE '%pommel%' 
ORDER BY date;
- Result:
  • Athlete: Hermann Weingärtner | Nation: Germany | Date: 9 April 1896 | Medal Count: 4 | Sport: Gymnastics | Record Medal Event: Pommel Horse S

WHERE "record medal event" ILIKE '%pommel%';
- Result:

Conclusion: The dataset contains at least one athlete with a pommel horse medal event (“Pommel Horse S”), disproving the claim that no athlete received a pommel horse medal.

Assumptions:
- “record medal event” indicates the event/apparatus linked to an athlete’s medal, and “S” denotes silver.
