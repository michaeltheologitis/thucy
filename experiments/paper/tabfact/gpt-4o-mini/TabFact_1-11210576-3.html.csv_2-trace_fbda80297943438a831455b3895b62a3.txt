Overview:
- Task interpreted as: List all episode codes within the range 02x03 to 03x05 (inclusive) in which Max Martini appears, based on available authoritative data.
- Data source explored: TabFact database, schema public, table list_of_csi_miami_characters.

Data discovery and schema:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_csi_miami_characters
  - Columns: character (text), position (text), actor (text), first episode (text), final episode (text), duration (text), final episode count (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate entries for Max Martini and retrieve appearance span (duration):
SQL:
SELECT actor, character, "first episode", "final episode", duration 
FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters 
WHERE LOWER(actor) LIKE '%martini%';
Result (relevant row):
- Actor: Max Martini
- Character: Bob Keaton
- First Episode: Big Brother
- Final Episode: Vengeance
- Duration: 02x08, 03x20 - 03x22

2) Confirm that Max Martini’s duration includes episode 02x08:
SQL:
SELECT duration FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters 
WHERE actor = 'Max Martini' AND duration LIKE '%02x08%';
Result: Row returned (true) — duration contains 02x08.

3) Confirm there are no appearances for Max Martini between 03x01 and 03x05:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters 
WHERE actor = 'Max Martini' 
  AND (duration LIKE '%03x01%' OR duration LIKE '%03x02%' OR duration LIKE '%03x03%' OR duration LIKE '%03x04%' OR duration LIKE '%03x05%');
Result: 0 (no such episodes present in the duration field).

Conclusion:
- Max Martini’s documented CSI: Miami appearances are: 02x08 and 03x20–03x22.
- Within the requested range 02x03–03x05 (inclusive), the only matching episode is: 02x08.

Answer (list for 02x03–03x05):
- 02x08

Assumptions:
- The query pertains to CSI: Miami (the only available authoritative dataset here), and the ‘duration’ field encodes appearance episodes in the SSxEE format.
- The range 02x03–03x05 is interpreted inclusively.
- The user intent is to list the episodes (not runtime in minutes) in that range for Max Martini based on the ‘duration’ field.
