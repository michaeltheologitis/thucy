Claim interpreted: “Glenferrie Oval venue record [crowd] is 5,000 more than that of Arden Street Oval.” We verify this by comparing the maximum recorded crowds at each venue in the available dataset.

Data source explored
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1961_vfl_season (columns: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date)

Step 1 — Confirm venue names present
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season;
Result excerpt (relevant venues):
- Glenferrie Oval
- Arden Street Oval

Step 2 — Retrieve matches and crowds for Glenferrie Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", crowd 
FROM t_1961_vfl_season 
WHERE LOWER(venue) = LOWER('Glenferrie Oval') 
ORDER BY crowd DESC;
Result (top by crowd):
- Date: 3 June 1961 | Home Team: Hawthorn | Away Team: Richmond | Crowd: 15,000

Step 3 — Retrieve matches and crowds for Arden Street Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", crowd 
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season 
WHERE LOWER(venue) = LOWER('Arden Street Oval') 
ORDER BY crowd DESC;
Result (top by crowd):
- Date: 3 June 1961 | Home Team: North Melbourne | Away Team: St Kilda | Crowd: 13,000

Step 4 — Cross-check venue maximums via aggregation
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
GROUP BY venue;
Relevant results:
- Glenferrie Oval | max_crowd = 15,000
- Arden Street Oval | max_crowd = 13,000

Conclusion based on data
- Glenferrie Oval maximum recorded crowd (in this dataset): 15,000
- Arden Street Oval maximum recorded crowd (in this dataset): 13,000
- Difference (Glenferrie minus Arden Street): 15,000 − 13,000 = 2,000

This difference is not 5,000. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Venue record” is interpreted as the maximum recorded crowd for that venue within the available dataset (the t_1961_vfl_season table), not the all-time historical venue record outside this dataset. No external sources were used.
