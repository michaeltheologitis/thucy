Summary of data sources discovered:
- Accessible database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (columns: rank bigint, rowers text, country text, time text, notes text). No primary keys or constraints.

Schema evidence (tool output):
- Columns in public.my_info_table:
  - rank (bigint)
  - rowers (text)
  - country (text)
  - time (text)
  - notes (text)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Test the exact condition “rank > 4 AND country = 'Japan'” and show rank, rowers, country, time, notes
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, rowers, country, time, notes FROM my_info_table WHERE rank > 4 AND country = 'Japan';
- Result: No rows returned.

2) Repeat condition with case-insensitive country matching
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, rowers, country, time, notes FROM my_info_table WHERE rank > 4 AND LOWER(country) = 'japan';
- Result: No rows returned.

3) Check if any rows exist for country = Japan (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(country) = LOWER('Japan');
- Result: 1 row exists with country = Japan.

4) Retrieve the Japan row(s) to inspect rank and notes
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, rowers, country, time, notes 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(country) = 'japan';
- Result:
  - Rank: 3; Rowers: kazushige ura, daisaku takeda; Country: japan; Time: 6:43.03; Notes: sc / d

Conclusion:
- There are no records where rank > 4 and country = Japan. Therefore, there is no “note show sc / d” under that specific condition.
- There is exactly one Japan row in the table, but its rank is 3 (not > 4), and its notes value is “sc / d”.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “when rank be more than 4 and country be japan for note show sc / d” as a request to find records with rank > 4 and country = Japan and to display the notes field (expected value “sc / d”).
- Country matching treated as case-insensitive.
- Data source for the request is public.my_info_table based on discovered schema.
