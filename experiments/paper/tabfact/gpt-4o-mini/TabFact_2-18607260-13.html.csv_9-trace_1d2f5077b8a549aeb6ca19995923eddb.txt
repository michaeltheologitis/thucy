Claim being checked: “the game on june 18 and 28, both have a score of 2 - 0.”

Summary conclusion: The data contradicts this claim. There is no match on June 18, 1998 in the available dataset, and the June 28, 1998 match does not have a 2-0 score.

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL):

1) Direct check for June 28, 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, report, score, venue, comp FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date = '1998 - 06 - 28'
- Result: One match found with score recorded as “0 - 0 ( 1 - 0 aet )” at Stade Félix Bollaert, Lens, France (World Cup). This is not “2 - 0”.

2) Direct check for June 18, 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, report, score, venue, comp FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date = '1998 - 06 - 18';
- Result: No rows returned. Therefore, there is no recorded game on June 18 in this dataset.

3) Contextual listing of 1998 dates (to show June entries present and that 06 - 18 is absent)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, report, score, venue, comp FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '1998%';
- Relevant rows among the results include:
  - 1998 - 06 - 12: score 0 - 0 (World Cup)
  - 1998 - 06 - 19: score 0 - 0 (World Cup)
  - 1998 - 06 - 24: score 1 - 3 (World Cup)
  - 1998 - 06 - 28: score 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet) (World Cup)
  There is no 1998 - 06 - 18 entry in this list, reinforcing that no June 18 match exists in the table.

Assessment vs. claim:
- June 18: No match recorded, so cannot have a 2 - 0 score.
- June 28: Recorded match is 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet), not 2 - 0.

Therefore, the claim that “the game on june 18 and 28, both have a score of 2 - 0” is not supported by the data and is contradicted by the June 28 entry.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “the game on june 18 and 28” as referring to 1998 dates within the only available dataset, t_1998_in_paraguayan_football.
- Date strings in the table use the format “YYYY - MM - DD” with spaces around dashes, as evidenced by the sample and queried rows.
- The dataset is considered authoritative for the relevant matches in 1998, so absence of an entry implies no recorded match on that date within this scope.
