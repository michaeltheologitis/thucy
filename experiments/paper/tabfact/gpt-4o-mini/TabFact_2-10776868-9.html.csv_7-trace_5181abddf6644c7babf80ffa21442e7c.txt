Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1962_vfl_season
- Relevant columns: "home team" (text), "away team" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence 1: All matches that day ordered by crowd (smallest to largest)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", crowd FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season ORDER BY crowd ASC;

Returned rows:
- 23 June 1962 | North Melbourne vs Hawthorn | crowd = 8470
- 23 June 1962 | South Melbourne vs Richmond | crowd = 17000
- 23 June 1962 | Collingwood vs Fitzroy | crowd = 26488
- 23 June 1962 | Carlton vs Footscray | crowd = 32400
- 23 June 1962 | Essendon vs Geelong | crowd = 35000
- 23 June 1962 | Melbourne vs St Kilda | crowd = 48952

Observation: The smallest crowd is 8,470 for North Melbourne vs Hawthorn. South Melbourne vs Richmond drew 17,000, which is higher than 8,470.

Evidence 2: Match with the smallest crowd per date
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", crowd
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
WHERE (date, crowd) IN (
    SELECT date, MIN(crowd)
    FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season
    GROUP BY date
);

Returned result:
- Date: 23 June 1962 | Home Team: North Melbourne | Away Team: Hawthorn | Crowd: 8,470

Conclusion
- The match between South Melbourne and Richmond did not draw the smallest crowd of the day. The smallest crowd on 23 June 1962 was at North Melbourne vs Hawthorn (8,470). South Melbourne vs Richmond had 17,000 attendees.

Assumptions
- “Of the day” refers to the single date present in the dataset (23 June 1962), which appears to cover one round/day of matches.
- “Draw the smallest crowd” is interpreted as having the minimum value in the "crowd" column among all matches on that date.
