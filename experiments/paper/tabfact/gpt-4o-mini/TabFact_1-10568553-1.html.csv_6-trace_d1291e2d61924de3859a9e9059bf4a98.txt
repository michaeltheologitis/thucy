Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “Hanover in Plymouth County intersects Route 123.” Given the available data source focuses on Massachusetts Route 139, I interpret this as checking whether, within Hanover (Plymouth County), an intersection along Route 139 involves Route 123.

Data sources discovered
- Available database: public schema with table massachusetts_route_139 (columns: county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes).

Evidence collected
1) Entries mentioning Hanover
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Hanover%' OR notes ILIKE '%Hanover%';
- Result (summarized):
  • County: Plymouth; Location: Hanover; Milepost: 17.9; Roads Intersected: route 53; Notes: northern terminus of route 53 / 139 concurrency; Street names: hanover street rockland street columbia road.
- This shows that in Hanover, Route 139 intersects Route 53, not Route 123.

2) Where Route 139 intersects Route 123
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, location FROM massachusetts_route_139 WHERE "roads intersected" LIKE '%123%';
- Result: two entries, both in Plymouth County, Location: Rockland.

- Executed SQL (detail for Rockland occurrences):
  SELECT location, milepost, "roads intersected", notes 
  FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 
  WHERE location ILIKE '%Rockland%' AND "roads intersected" LIKE '%123%';
- Result:
  • Location: Rockland; Milepost: 12.2; Roads Intersected: Route 123; Notes: Western terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency.
  • Location: Rockland; Milepost: 12.8; Roads Intersected: Route 123; Notes: Eastern terminus of route 123 / 139 concurrency.
- Interpretation: Route 123 and Route 139 run concurrently in Rockland (mileposts ~12.2–12.8), not in Hanover.

3) No Route 123 intersection recorded for Hanover
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location = 'Hanover' AND "roads intersected" LIKE '%123%';
- Result: No rows.

4) County verification for Hanover entry
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT county, location FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Hanover%';
- Result: County: Plymouth; Location: Hanover.
- Confirms the Hanover row in this dataset is in Plymouth County.

Conclusion
- The data shows that within Hanover (Plymouth County), the recorded intersection on Route 139 is with Route 53, not Route 123. All intersections between Route 139 and Route 123 in this dataset occur in Rockland. Therefore, the specific claim that Hanover intersects Route 123 is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The only accessible authoritative dataset concerns Massachusetts Route 139. I interpreted “intersects Route 123” to mean an intersection involving Route 123 along Route 139 within the town noted (Hanover). If the intended meaning was that Massachusetts Route 123 passes through Hanover regardless of Route 139, that cannot be directly verified here due to the absence of a Route 123 table or geometry data in the available sources.
