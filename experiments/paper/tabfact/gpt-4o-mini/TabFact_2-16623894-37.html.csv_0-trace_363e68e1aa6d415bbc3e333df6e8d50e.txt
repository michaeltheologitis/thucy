Summary of verification steps:
- Discovered available data: a table for UEFA Europa League 2009–10 ties.
- Identified schema: public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league with columns: "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" (all text).
- Queried for the row where "team 1" contains 'Panathinaikos' and inspected the first leg score.

Evidence from data:
- Retrieved row:
  - team 1: panathinaikos
  - team 2: standard liège
  - 1st leg: 1 - 3
  - 2nd leg: 0 - 1
  - agg: 1 - 4

Executed SQL (as returned by the query tool):
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league 
WHERE LOWER("team 1") LIKE LOWER('%Panathinaikos%');

Conclusion:
- The data shows that for the tie where "team 1" is Panathinaikos, the first leg score is "1 - 3". This matches the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "team 1 of panathinaikos" to mean the row where the column "team 1" equals Panathinaikos in the available 2009–10 UEFA Europa League dataset.
- Interpreted "first leg score be 1 - 3" as matching the textual score value "1 - 3" (spacing preserved) in the "1st leg" column.
