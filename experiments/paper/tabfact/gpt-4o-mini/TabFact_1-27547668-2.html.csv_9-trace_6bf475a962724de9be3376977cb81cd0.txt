Scope and data source
- Explored available sources: a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (one row per episode). Relevant column for directors: "directed by" (text).
- Schema (key columns): title (text), directed by (text), original airdate (text), prod code (bigint).

Key evidence
1) Episode counts by director (case-insensitive substring match on "directed by")
- SQL (Steve Scaini):
  SELECT 'Steve Scaini' AS director_name, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%steve scaini%'
  GROUP BY director_name;
  Result: director_name = Steve Scaini, episode_count = 1

- SQL (Mike Clattenburg):
  SELECT 'Mike Clattenburg' AS director_name, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%mike clattenburg%'
  GROUP BY director_name;
  Result: director_name = Mike Clattenburg, episode_count = 2

- Combined SQL (for convenience):
  (SELECT 'Steve Scaini' AS director_name, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
   FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
   WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%steve scaini%'
   GROUP BY director_name)
  UNION ALL
  (SELECT 'Mike Clattenburg' AS director_name, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
   FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
   WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%mike clattenburg%'
   GROUP BY director_name);
  Combined result: Steve Scaini = 1; Mike Clattenburg = 2

2) Episode titles for each director
- SQL (Steve Scaini):
  SELECT title, "original airdate", "prod code"
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") ILIKE '%steve scaini%';
  Results:
  - Title: A Horse Divided | Original Airdate: March 31, 2010 | Prod Code: 111

- SQL (Mike Clattenburg):
  SELECT title, "original airdate", "prod code"
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") ILIKE '%mike clattenburg%';
  Results:
  - Title: Fathers and Sons | Original Airdate: January 6, 2010 | Prod Code: 101
  - Title: Duchess of George | Original Airdate: January 20, 2010 | Prod Code: 103

3) Check for co-directed overlap (same episode listing both names)
- SQL:
  SELECT title
  FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%steve scaini%'
    AND LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%mike clattenburg%';
  Result: No rows returned (no episode lists both names together).

Conclusion
- Within the Republic of Doyle episodes data, Steve Scaini directed 1 episode and Mike Clattenburg directed 2 episodes. Therefore, Steve Scaini did not direct one more episode than Mike Clattenburg; he directed one fewer.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (Republic of Doyle episodes). Matching is case-insensitive and counts any episode where the director’s name appears anywhere in the "directed by" text. No episodes are co-credited to both individuals in this dataset.
