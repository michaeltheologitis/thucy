Claim: “the opponent be the yankee when the record be 4 - 5.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season (columns: date text, opponent text, score text, loss text, attendance bigint, record text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify that a 4 - 5 record exists
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT record FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season;
- Result includes: 4 - 5 (among other records)

2) Retrieve the game(s) with record exactly 4 - 5 and check opponent
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, record
  FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season
  WHERE record = '4 - 5';
- Result:
  date: April 12; opponent: Yankees; score: 5 - 3; record: 4 - 5

3) Confirm uniqueness (how many times the record equals 4 - 5)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1989_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE record = '4 - 5';
- Result: 1

Conclusion
- The table shows exactly one instance where the team’s record is 4 - 5, and in that instance the opponent is the Yankees. This supports the claim (noting the minor singular/plural wording difference “yankee” vs “Yankees”).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available data source: the 1989 Toronto Blue Jays season table.
- “yankee” refers to the New York Yankees.
- The “record” field represents the team’s season record at that point in time, as stored in the dataset.
