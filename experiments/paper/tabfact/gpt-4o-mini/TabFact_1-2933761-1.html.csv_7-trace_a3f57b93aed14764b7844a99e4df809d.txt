Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: cube_film_series. Relevant columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text).

Evidence collected:
1) List all records with gender and prison connection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, gender, "prison connection" FROM public.cube_film_series;
- Result (relevant rows):
  - joan leaven | female | leavenworth prison (usa)
  - dr helen holloway | female | holloway women’s prison (uk)

2) Count of total female entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_female_entries FROM cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female';
- Result: 2

3) Count of female entries with a UK prison connection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female' AND "prison connection" ILIKE '%UK%';
- Result: 1

Assessment:
- There are two female entries in the dataset. Only one of them (Dr. Helen Holloway) has a prison connection in the UK. The other female entry (Joan Leaven) is connected to Leavenworth Prison in the USA. Therefore, the claim that both female have a prison connection in the UK is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "both female" refers to the two records in the only available dataset where gender = 'female'.
- "prison connection in the UK" is operationalized as the prison connection field containing the substring 'UK'.
