Conclusion:
Based on the available 1996 PGA Championship dataset, Frank Nobilo is the only player from New Zealand represented in this table.

Evidence:
1) Country distribution of players in t_1996_pga_championship
- Result excerpt: New Zealand: 1 player
- Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
GROUP BY country;

2) Full rows (ordered by country, then player)
- Relevant row shows: Frank Nobilo — Country: New Zealand
- The listing shows only one row with Country = New Zealand, and the player is Frank Nobilo.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par", money 
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship 
ORDER BY country, player;

Assumptions:
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the accessible dataset (public.t_1996_pga_championship), which appears to represent the 1996 PGA Championship results included in the database. No broader inference (e.g., across all tournaments or all golfers historically) is made beyond this dataset.
