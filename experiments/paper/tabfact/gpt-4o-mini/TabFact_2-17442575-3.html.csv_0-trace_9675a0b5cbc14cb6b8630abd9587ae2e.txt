Claim to verify: “on april 17 the home team be the chicago black hawk and the record be 2 - 3.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL public schema containing: t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season

Schema details for the relevant table:
- t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season columns:
  - date (text)
  - visitor (text)
  - score (text)
  - home (text)
  - record (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Comprehensive view of the table to identify April entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season;
- Returned data includes the following rows around mid-April:
  - april 17 | detroit red wings | 5 - 3 | chicago black hawks | 2 - 3
  (This row shows the home team as “chicago black hawks” and the record as “2 - 3”.)

2) Targeted lookup for April 17 to confirm home team and record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, home, record FROM t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE date = 'april 17';
- Result:
  - date: april 17
  - home: chicago black hawks
  - record: 2 - 3

Assessment of the claim:
- The data explicitly shows that on “april 17” the home team is “chicago black hawks” and the record is “2 - 3.”
- The claim uses “chicago black hawk” (singular), while the data uses “chicago black hawks” (plural). This is a minor naming/grammatical deviation and does not alter the substance of the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the April 17 entry in the available 1965-66 Chicago Black Hawks season table, as this is the only accessible dataset containing an April 17 record relevant to the Chicago Black Hawks.
- The lowercase date formatting (e.g., “april 17”) and team naming in the dataset are taken as-is and matched literally in queries.
