Summary
Claim: “the original airdate of episode 7 be 19 april 2008.”
Finding: Not supported by the available data. The table contains no record with episode number 7. The date 19 April 2008 exists but corresponds to episode 31 titled “the homecoming.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with one table in public schema: my_info_table.
- Schema (via tool): columns — episode (bigint), series (bigint), episode title (text), original air date (text), production code (bigint).

Executed queries and evidence
1) Check for any row with episode = 7
SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "original air date"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE episode = 7;
Result: No rows returned.

2) Check for rows with original air date equal to '19 april 2008' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "original air date"
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE LOWER("original air date") = '19 april 2008';
Result: 1 row — Episode Title: the homecoming; Original Air Date: 19 April 2008.

3) Retrieve full details for rows with that date
SQL:
SELECT series, episode, "episode title", "original air date"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE LOWER("original air date") = LOWER('19 april 2008');
Result: Series: 5; Episode: 31; Episode Title: the homecoming; Original Air Date: 19 April 2008.

4) Show distinct episode numbers present (to confirm absence of 7)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT episode
FROM my_info_table;
Result (excerpt): 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, …, 51. Note: 7 is not present.

5) Small sample to understand context around dates
SQL:
SELECT series, episode, "episode title", "original air date"
FROM my_info_table
LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt): includes Episode 31 “the homecoming” with Original Air Date “19 April 2008”; no episode 7 entries.

Analysis
- There are no records with episode number 7 in the dataset.
- The date 19 April 2008 is in the dataset but is associated with episode 31 (“the homecoming”), not episode 7.

Conclusion
Based on the data, the claim that “the original airdate of episode 7 be 19 april 2008” is not supported. The dataset shows 19 April 2008 as the airdate for episode 31, not 7, and no entry exists for episode 7.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “episode 7” as the value in the episode column of the available my_info_table. No show title was provided; verification is constrained to the accessible dataset.
