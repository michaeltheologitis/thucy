Claim interpreted: “Michael Phelps has more medals than Larisa Latynina.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table: public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (columns: medal count, date, athlete, nation, sport, record medal event)

Step 1: Confirm athletes appear and see relative standings
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, "medal count", sport, nation
  FROM list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  ORDER BY "medal count" DESC
  LIMIT 25;
- Observed entries (excerpt):
  - michael phelps with medal counts including 22, 21, 20, 19, 18
  - larisa latynina with medal counts including 18, 17, 16, 15, 14, 13
  This indicates multiple rows per athlete and suggests using the maximum recorded medal count per athlete for a fair comparison.

Step 2: Compute maximum medal counts for the two athletes
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, MAX("medal count") AS max_medal_count
  FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
  WHERE LOWER(athlete) IN ('michael phelps', 'larisa latynina')
  GROUP BY athlete;
- Result summary:
  - Michael Phelps: 22 medals (max)
  - Larisa Latynina: 18 medals (max)

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative dataset, Michael Phelps’ maximum recorded medal count (22) exceeds Larisa Latynina’s (18). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Medal count” refers to total Olympic medals and is comparable across athletes.
- Because the table contains multiple records per athlete with varying counts, the maximum recorded medal count per athlete represents their total career medals within this dataset.
- The user’s “larisa latyna” refers to “Larisa Latynina.”
