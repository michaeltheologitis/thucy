Data sources explored:
- Discovered database: contains table t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season (Philadelphia Flyers 2004–05 season).
- Relevant schema fields: player (text), position (text), among others.

Step 1: Confirm how positions are recorded
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT position FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season;
- Result: defense; center; left wing; right wing; goaltender

Step 2: Identify all players with position exactly “left wing” and count them
- Executed SQL (list players):
  SELECT player FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE position = 'left wing';
- Result: Triston Grant

- Executed SQL (count players):
  SELECT COUNT(*) as player_count FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE position = 'left wing';
- Result: 1
