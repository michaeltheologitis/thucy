Claim to verify: “the time for Wallace Spearmon of the United States be more than the time for Rondell Sorillo of Trinidad and Tobago.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public
- Available table: athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres (columns: lane, athlete, nationality, time, react)

Evidence gathered:
1) Full listing of athletes and results in the dataset
- Result excerpt (relevant rows):
  - Wallace Spearmon — United States — Time: 20.39 — Reaction: 0.202
  - Rondell Sorillo — Trinidad and Tobago — Time: 20.63 — Reaction: 0.164
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, nationality, time, react FROM athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres;

Analysis:
- Numeric comparison: 20.39 (Spearmon) vs 20.63 (Sorillo). 20.39 < 20.63.
- Therefore, Spearmon’s time is not more than Sorillo’s time in this dataset; it is less (faster).

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the user’s claim as a direct numeric comparison of the recorded times for Wallace Spearmon and Rondell Sorillo as provided in the accessible 2008 Olympics men’s 200 m dataset. Times are in seconds.
