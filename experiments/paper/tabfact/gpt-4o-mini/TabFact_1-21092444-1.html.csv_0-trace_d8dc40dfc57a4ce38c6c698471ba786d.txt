Claim: "on october 11th, the black knight lose to duke"

What I checked
- Explored available data sources and found a PostgreSQL table for the 1975 Army Cadets (Army Black Knights) football season: public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team.
- Reviewed the table schema to identify date, opponent, and result fields.
- Queried the table for any game on Oct 11 versus Duke.

Evidence from data
1) Full season view to locate the relevant game
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team ORDER BY game ASC;
Result excerpt shows:
- game 5 | date: oct 11 | opponent: duke | result: loss | black knights points: 10 | opponents: 21 | record after game: 2 - 3

2) Targeted lookup for Oct 11 vs Duke
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents 
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team 
WHERE date = 'oct 11' AND opponent = 'duke';
Result:
- Date: oct 11; Opponent: duke; Result: loss; Black Knights Points: 10; Opponent's Points: 21

Conclusion
- The data shows that on Oct 11 (1975 season), Army (Black Knights/Cadets) lost to Duke, 10–21. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions and scope notes
- "Black Knight" is interpreted as the Army Black Knights football team (historically called Army Cadets in 1975). The table name reflects the 1975 season but the points column uses "black knights points."
- The available dataset covers only the 1975 Army football season; verification is within this scope. The claim did not specify the year, but within this data it is true.
