Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that (Mark Brooks) and Kenny Perry tied for the lowest score relative to par (best to-par) in the referenced event. Based on the available data source (1996 PGA Championship table), this means they shared the lowest 72-hole to-par score at the end of regulation.

What the data shows:
- The 1996 PGA Championship leaderboard in public.t_1996_pga_championship contains player finishing positions, scores, and “to par”.
- After normalizing the “to par” text values to integers, the most-under-par (lowest) value is −11, achieved by two players: Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry.

Key evidence and executed SQL:
1) Full ordering by normalized to-par (most negative first)
SQL:
SELECT place, player, score, "to par", 
       CASE 
           WHEN REPLACE("to par", ' ', '') = 'E' THEN '0' 
           ELSE REPLACE(LTRIM(REPLACE("to par", ' ', '')), '+', '') 
       END::integer AS normalized_to_par_int 
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship 
ORDER BY normalized_to_par_int ASC, place;
Result excerpt (top rows):
- place=1, player=mark brooks, score=68 + 70 + 69 + 70 = 277, to par=- 11, normalized_to_par_int=-11
- place=2, player=kenny perry, score=66 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 277, to par=- 11, normalized_to_par_int=-11
- place=t3, player=steve elkington, score=... , to par=- 10, normalized_to_par_int=-10
- place=t3, player=tommy tolles, score=... , to par=- 10, normalized_to_par_int=-10

2) Directly list players with the lowest to-par (−11)
SQL:
SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE (CASE WHEN REPLACE("to par", ' ', '') = 'E' THEN '0' ELSE REPLACE(REPLACE("to par", ' ', ''), '+', '') END)::integer = -11;
Result:
- Place: 1, Player: Mark Brooks, Score: 68 + 70 + 69 + 70 = 277, To Par: -11
- Place: 2, Player: Kenny Perry, Score: 66 + 72 + 71 + 68 = 277, To Par: -11

Conclusion:
- The data confirms that Mark Brooks and Kenny Perry tied for the lowest to-par (−11) at the end of regulation in the 1996 PGA Championship. The claim’s substance is correct. Note: the name should be “Mark Brooks,” not “mark brook.”

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1996 PGA Championship (the only available data source) and to “lowest to par” as the lowest 72-hole score relative to par, excluding any playoff holes.
