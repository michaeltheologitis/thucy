Claim to verify: “saint - louis fc game have the highest combined agg of any of the featured game.”

Interpretation of the claim
- “saint - louis fc game” refers to the two-legged tie in the available dataset involving the team Saint - Louis FC.
- “combined agg” is interpreted as the sum of the two teams’ aggregate goals for the tie (i.e., the two numbers before any penalty-shootout parentheses in the agg field).
- “featured game” is interpreted as any tie listed in the available table public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (the only available dataset).

Data discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs for the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
- Table columns: team 1 (text), agg (text), team 2 (text), 1st leg (text), 2nd leg (text). No keys.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm presence and formatting (shows “saint - louis fc” and its aggregate)
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "agg", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs LIMIT 50;
Key observed row from results:
- team 1: saint - louis fc; agg: 2 - 7; team 2: young africans (1st leg: 1 - 3; 2nd leg: 1 - 4)

2) Compute combined aggregates and view ordering (shows Saint - Louis FC tie at top with total 9)
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg",
       (CAST(SUBSTRING("agg" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) +
        CAST(SUBSTRING("agg" FROM '\s[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS combined_agg
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
ORDER BY combined_agg DESC
LIMIT 20;
Key results excerpt (combined_agg = sum of first two numbers in agg):
- Saint - Louis FC vs Young Africans: agg 2 - 7, combined_agg 9
- CD Elá Nguema vs Primeiro de Agosto: agg 2 - 6, combined_agg 8
- Sahel SC vs Postel Sport: agg 4 - 2, combined_agg 6
- Saint - George SA vs Al Ittihad: agg 2 - 4, combined_agg 6
(others lower)

3) Definitively identify all ties with the maximum combined aggregate
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "agg",
(CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 1) AS INT) + CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 3) AS INT)) AS combined_agg
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE (CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 1) AS INT) + CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 3) AS INT))
= (SELECT MAX(CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 1) AS INT) + CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' ', 3) AS INT))
   FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs)
ORDER BY combined_agg DESC;
Result:
- Team 1: Saint-Louis FC; Team 2: Young Africans; Aggregate: 2 - 7; Combined Aggregate Goals: 9
This query returns only this tie at the maximum combined aggregate of 9.

Conclusion
- The tie involving Saint - Louis FC has the highest combined aggregate (9) among all ties in the featured dataset. The evidence shows no other tie matches or exceeds 9.

Verdict: Verified

Assumptions
- “Featured game” refers to all ties in the table public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs.
- “Combined agg” means A + B from the agg text “A - B …”, ignoring any penalty shootout numbers in parentheses.
