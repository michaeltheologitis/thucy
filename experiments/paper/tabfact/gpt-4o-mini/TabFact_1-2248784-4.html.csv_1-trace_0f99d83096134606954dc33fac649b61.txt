Claim to verify: "iraq have a gdp (ppp) (billions usd) on 127348 in 2011"

Step 1: Discover available data sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table named list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp that contains 2011 GDP (PPP) values in billions of USD for Asian and Pacific countries.

Step 2: Inspect schema
- Table: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
- Columns:
  - rank mideast (bigint)
  - rank asia (bigint)
  - rank world (bigint)
  - country (text)
  - 2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd (double precision)

Step 3: Retrieve evidence
A. Query all countries and their 2011 GDP (PPP) values to confirm Iraq’s entry
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp;
- Key output excerpt (relevant row):
  - Iraq | 127.348
  - Additional context from the same query included neighboring entries (e.g., Iran 930.236; Saudi Arabia 677.663; etc.).

B. Query specifically for Iraq to confirm the exact value and ranks
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE LOWER(country) = LOWER('Iraq')
- Result:
  - Country: Iraq
  - 2011 GDP (PPP) billions of USD: 127.348
  - Rank in Asia: 23
  - Rank in Middle East: 7
  - Rank in World: 60

Assessment
- The authoritative table reports Iraq’s 2011 GDP (PPP) as 127.348 (billions of USD). The claim states “127348 (billions USD).” Interpreted literally as 127,348 billions USD, it would be incorrect; however, given the context and common formatting in such datasets, it appears the decimal point was omitted and the intended value is 127.348 billions USD. The data directly supports this intended value.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data when interpreting “127348” as a formatting variant of 127.348 billions USD for 2011.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the figure “127348” as 127.348 (a missing decimal point) in billions USD, consistent with the table’s unit and typical magnitudes for Iraq’s 2011 GDP (PPP).
