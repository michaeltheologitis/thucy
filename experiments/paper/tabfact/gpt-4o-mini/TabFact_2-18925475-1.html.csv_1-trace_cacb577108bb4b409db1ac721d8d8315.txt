Claim interpreted: “If a computer has the VLAN setting feature for the Intel AMT network interface, then it does not have (or is not supported by) AMT 3.0.”

What the data shows:
- We located a features-by-AMT-version reference table: public.intel_amt_versions.
- The row for “VLAN settings for Intel AMT network interfaces” explicitly shows that AMT 3.0 (desktop) supports this feature (value = yes).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve the VLAN-related feature row and version support values
SQL:
SELECT feature, "amt 1.0 (desktop)", "amt 2.0 / 2.1 (desktop)", "amt 2.5 / 2.6 (mobile)", "amt 3.0 (desktop)", "amt 4.0 (mobile)", "amt 5.0 (desktop)", "6.0 (desktop & mobile)", "7.0 & 8.0 (desktop & mobile)"
FROM intel_amt_versions
WHERE feature ILIKE '%VLAN%';

Result (relevant part):
- Feature: VLAN settings for Intel AMT network interfaces
- amt 3.0 (desktop): yes
- Other versions (for context):
  - amt 1.0 (desktop): no
  - amt 2.0 / 2.1 (desktop): no
  - amt 2.5 / 2.6 (mobile): no
  - amt 4.0 (mobile): no
  - amt 5.0 (desktop): yes
  - 6.0 (desktop & mobile): yes
  - 7.0 & 8.0 (desktop & mobile): yes

2) Confirm only one VLAN-related row exists
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.intel_amt_versions WHERE feature ILIKE '%VLAN%';

Result: 1 row

Assessment of the claim:
- The claim states that having the VLAN setting feature for Intel AMT network interface implies not having AMT 3.0. The data contradicts this: for the VLAN settings feature, the AMT 3.0 (desktop) column is “yes,” indicating support.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “it do not have amt 3.0” is interpreted as “AMT 3.0 does not support this feature.”
- The intel_amt_versions table is treated as authoritative for feature support across AMT versions (desktop/mobile distinctions as labeled in the table).
