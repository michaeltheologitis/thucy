Claim to verify: “2.63 million people in China saw the episode called ‘Kandor.’”

Step 1 — Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database for Smallville Season 9 with one table: public.smallville_season_9. Key fields include episode title, US air date, and “us viewers (million).” There are no fields for China-specific viewership.

Relevant schema details
- Table: public.smallville_season_9
  - title (text)
  - us air date (text)
  - us viewers (million) (double precision)

Step 2 — Evidence from the data
A. Direct lookup for the episode titled “kandor”:
SQL executed:
SELECT title, "us air date", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE title = 'kandor';

Result:
- Title: kandor
- US Air Date: November 6, 2009
- US Viewers (Million): 2.63

B. Cross-check by listing all episodes (confirms the same figure for “kandor”):
SQL executed:
SELECT title, "us air date", "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9;

Excerpt of relevant row from results:
- kandor | November 6, 2009 | 2.63

Assessment
- The database records 2.63 million US viewers for the Smallville S9 episode “kandor.”
- The dataset contains only US viewership; it has no metrics for China. Therefore, the specific claim that 2.63 million people in China saw the episode is not supported by the available data. The 2.63 million figure clearly refers to US viewers, not China, per the evidence above.

Conclusion
- The numerical figure (2.63 million) matches the episode’s US viewership, but attributing that number to China is not supported by the data and is materially incorrect.

Assumptions
- “Episode call kandor” refers to the Smallville Season 9 episode titled “kandor.”
- If China-specific viewership existed in the available authoritative source, it would appear as a distinct field; none is present.
