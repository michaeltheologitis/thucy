Claim interpretation: The statement appears to mean “North Melbourne have the highest single-game score by any away team.” I verify this against the available 1975 VFL season database.

Data sources discovered
- Database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Table: t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL season matches)
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence 1: List the match(es) where the away team achieved the maximum total points (single game)
Executed SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT
    "away team" AS away_team,
    "away team score" AS away_team_score,
    "home team" AS home_team,
    "home team score" AS home_team_score,
    "date",
    "venue",
    CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS int) AS away_points
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
)
SELECT away_team, away_team_score, away_points, home_team, home_team_score, date, venue
FROM parsed
WHERE away_points = (SELECT MAX(away_points) FROM parsed)
ORDER BY away_points DESC;

Result (from the database):
- Away Team: North Melbourne; Away Team Score: 17.19 (121); Away Points: 121; Home Team: St Kilda; Home Team Score: 15.9 (99); Date: 7 June 1975; Venue: Moorabbin Oval

Evidence 2: Confirm the numeric maximum away points value
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS int)) AS max_away_points
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;

Result (from the database):
- max_away_points = 121

Conclusion
- Within the 1975 VFL season dataset, the highest single-game total points by an away team is 121, achieved by North Melbourne (17.19 [121]) at St Kilda on 7 June 1975 at Moorabbin Oval. This supports the claim that North Melbourne have the highest score among all away teams (for that season).

Assumptions made
- “highest score out all the way team” is interpreted as the highest single-game total points by an away team.
- Scope is limited to the available data source (1975 VFL season).
