Claim assessed: “the dolphins' defense record 3 shutout during the 1983 season.”

Evidence gathered from the available data source (treated as authoritative):

1) Full 1983 Miami Dolphins game results
- What I did: Retrieved all rows for the 1983 Miami Dolphins season to inspect each game’s result and identify shutouts (opponent points = 0).
- SQL executed:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week;
- Result (abridged to key fields):
Week 1 vs Buffalo Bills — Result: W 12 - 0
Week 2 vs New England Patriots — Result: W 34 - 24
Week 3 vs Los Angeles Raiders — Result: L 27 - 14
Week 4 vs Kansas City Chiefs — Result: W 14 - 6
Week 5 vs New Orleans Saints — Result: L 17 - 7
Week 6 vs Buffalo Bills — Result: L 38 - 35
Week 7 vs New York Jets — Result: W 32 - 14
Week 8 vs Baltimore Colts — Result: W 21 - 7
Week 9 vs Los Angeles Rams — Result: W 30 - 14
Week 10 vs San Francisco 49ers — Result: W 20 - 17
Week 11 vs New England Patriots — Result: L 17 - 6
Week 12 vs Baltimore Colts — Result: W 37 - 0
Week 13 vs Cincinnati Bengals — Result: W 38 - 14
Week 14 vs Houston Oilers — Result: W 24 - 17
Week 15 vs Atlanta Falcons — Result: W 31 - 24
Week 16 vs New York Jets — Result: W 34 - 14

2) Direct shutout count and details
- What I did: Counted games where the opponent scored 0 and listed those games.
- SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS shutout_count
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE result ~ '\\d+ - 0';
- SQL executed (list):
SELECT week, opponent
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
WHERE result ~ '\\d+ - 0';
- Result: shutout_count = 2
- Games: Week 1 vs Buffalo Bills; Week 12 vs Baltimore Colts

Conclusion
- The data show 2 shutouts (Weeks 1 and 12), not 3. Therefore, the claim that the Dolphins recorded 3 shutouts during the 1983 season is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- “Dolphins” refers to the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- “1983 season” refers to the 1983 regular season games reflected in the provided table.
- “Shutout” means holding the opponent to 0 points in a game.
