Claim to verify: For the 2010–2011 season, the winner was Kanto Gakuin University, attendance was N/A, and the title was 37th.

Data source explored: public.all_japan_university_rugby_championship (authoritative per available data sources).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Locate the 2010–2011 season entry
SQL:
SELECT season, title, winner, attendance 
FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
WHERE season LIKE '2010%'
Result:
- Season: 2010 - 11 details
- Title: 47th
- Winner: Teikyo
- Attendance: 25,458

2) Confirm there are no other 2010 season variants
SQL:
SELECT season, title, winner, attendance FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship WHERE season LIKE '%2010%' ORDER BY title ASC;
Result:
- Season: 2010 - 11 details
- Title: 47th
- Winner: teikyo
- Attendance: 25458

Assessment against the claim:
- Winner: Claimed “Kanto Gakuin University” vs Data “Teikyo” → Mismatch.
- Attendance: Claimed “N/A” vs Data “25,458” → Mismatch.
- Title: Claimed “37th” vs Data “47th” → Mismatch.

Conclusion: All three specified details contradict the authoritative table entry for the 2010–2011 season.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the All Japan University Rugby Championship season details, as this is the only relevant available dataset and contains season, title, winner, and attendance fields that match the claim’s structure.
