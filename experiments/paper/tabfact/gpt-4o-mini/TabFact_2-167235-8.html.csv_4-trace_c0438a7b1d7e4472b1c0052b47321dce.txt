Claim interpreted: “Only one person has been a member of the Party of Labour of Albania and been elected [Prime Minister].” I interpret “be elect” as “served as Prime Minister,” and “member” as reflected by the ‘political party’ field.

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing the table list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania (columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party).

Evidence
1) Identify whether the Party of Labour of Albania appears in the data and how many entries it has
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "political party", COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
GROUP BY "political party";
Result excerpt (relevant row):
- Party of Labour of Albania: 1

2) Count how many distinct prime ministers are associated with the Party of Labour of Albania
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, COUNT(DISTINCT name) AS distinct_names
FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
WHERE lower(trim("political party")) LIKE '%party of labour of albania%';
Result:
- row_count = 1
- distinct_names = 1

3) List the prime minister(s) associated with the Party of Labour of Albania
SQL executed:
SELECT name
FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
WHERE lower(trim("political party")) LIKE '%party of labour of albania%'
ORDER BY name;
Result:
- Fatos Nano (1st time)

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one prime minister associated with the Party of Labour of Albania. Therefore, the claim that “only 1 person … [was in the Party of Labour of Albania] and [was elected/served as PM]” is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “be elect” is taken to mean “served as Prime Minister.”
- “member of the party” is inferred from the ‘political party’ field in the table.
- Verification is limited to the available table; no external data was used.
