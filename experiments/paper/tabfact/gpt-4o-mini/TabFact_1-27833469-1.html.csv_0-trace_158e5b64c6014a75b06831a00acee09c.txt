What I checked
- Available data sources (discovery): A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a table public.will_grace_season_5 containing episode-level fields including season, title, and directed by.

Key evidence from the data
1) Query to find any episode whose title mentions “videotape” and return its season and director:
SQL executed:
SELECT season, title, "directed by" FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE lower(title) LIKE '%videotape%';

Result returned by the database:
- Season: 19
- Title: Sex, Losers, and Videotape
- Directed by: James Burrows

Conclusion
- The dataset shows an episode titled “Sex, Losers, and Videotape” in season 19, directed by James Burrows. This directly supports the claim that James Burrow(s) directed the episode “Sex, Loser(s), and Videotape” for season 19. Minor spelling/capitalization differences (e.g., “Burrow” vs. “Burrows,” “Loser” vs. “Losers”) do not affect the substantive correctness of the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s phrasing “sex , loser , and videotape” as the episode “Sex, Losers, and Videotape.”
- Interpreted “james burrow” as “James Burrows,” the director name returned by the data.
