Claim to verify: “There are zero purses after 2012 that have a winner’s share of less than 15400.”

Summary conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. There is at least one post-2012 tournament (2013) with a winner’s share of 15000, which is less than 15400.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: northeast_delta_dental_international

Step 1: Confirm table columns
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'northeast_delta_dental_international';

Result (abbreviated, order as returned):
1) year
2) purse
3) winner's share
4) country
5) score
6) tournament location
7) dates
8) champion

Step 2: Inspect rows after 2012 and see the winner’s share values
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012;

Result:
- champion: pk kongkraphan
- country: thailand
- dates: jul 19 - 21
- purse: 100000
- score: 207 (9)
- tournament location: beaver meadow golf course
- winner's share: 15000
- year: 2013

Assessment
- The record for 2013 shows a winner’s share of 15000, which is less than 15400. Therefore, there is at least one purse (tournament entry) after 2012 with a winner’s share below 15400.

Final determination: The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions made
- “After 2012” is interpreted as year > 2012.
- “Purse” in the claim refers to a tournament entry/row, not the purse amount field; the condition being checked is on the “winner’s share” field.
