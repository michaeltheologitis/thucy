Claim to verify: “the lowest right ascension (RA) be ngc 2082 with a right ascension of 4 hour 8 minute and 58.1 second.”

Summary of findings:
- The dataset available (public.dorado_group) shows that the object with the lowest RA is ngc 1515 at 04h04 m02.7s (≈ 4.0674 hours), not ngc 2082.
- In this dataset, ngc 2082 has RA 05h41 m51.1s, not 04h08 m58.1s.
- No object in the dataset has an RA exactly equal to 04h08 m58.1s.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Inspecting sample rows to understand RA formatting (shows ngc 2082 RA string):
SQL:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )"
FROM dorado_group
LIMIT 20;
Key result excerpt:
- ngc 2082 | 05h41 m51.1s
- ngc 1515 | 04h04 m02.7s
…

2) Computing decimal RA and listing the 10 lowest RA objects (confirms the minimum RA is ngc 1515, not ngc 2082):
SQL:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )", 
       
       
       ( 
           REPLACE( split_part("ra ( j2000 )", 'h', 1), ' ', '')::float + 
           (REPLACE(split_part(split_part("ra ( j2000 )", 'h', 2), 'm', 1), ' ', '')::float) / 60 + 
           (REPLACE(split_part(split_part("ra ( j2000 )", 'h', 2), 'm', 2), 's', '')::float) / 3600 
       ) AS decimal_ra 
FROM dorado_group 
ORDER BY decimal_ra 
LIMIT 10;
Key result excerpt (name | Original RA | Decimal RA):
- ngc 1515 | 04h04 m02.7s | 4.0674
- ngc 1533 | 04h09 m51.8s | 4.1644
- …
(ngc 2082 does not appear among the lowest; its RA is ≈ 5.6975h based on its RA string, which is larger than the minimum.)

3) Retrieving RA for ngc 2082 (shows it is not 04h08 m58.1s):
SQL:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )" FROM dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 2082';
Result:
- ngc 2082 | 05h41 m51.1s

4) Checking whether any object has RA exactly 04h08 m58.1s:
SQL:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )" 
FROM dorado_group 
WHERE LOWER("ra ( j2000 )") = LOWER('04h08 m58.1s')
Result:
- No rows returned

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the dataset. The lowest RA object in the available data is ngc 1515 at 04h04 m02.7s. ngc 2082 has RA 05h41 m51.1s, and no object has RA 04h08 m58.1s.

Assumptions made:
- “Lowest RA” was interpreted as the smallest right ascension among objects in the available public.dorado_group table (the only accessible dataset). No broader catalog (e.g., entire NGC) was available to this environment, so conclusions are scoped to this dataset.
