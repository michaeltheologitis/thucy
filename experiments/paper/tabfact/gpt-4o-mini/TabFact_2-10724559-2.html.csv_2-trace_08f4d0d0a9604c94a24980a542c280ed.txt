Claim to verify: “diego milito , who score 86 goal , have a debut year of 2008.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.football_records_in_italy.
- Table columns (from schema inspection):
  - rank (bigint)
  - all - time rank (text)
  - name (text)
  - debut year (bigint)
  - current club (text)
  - goals (bigint)
  - apps (bigint)

Evidence from data (executed SQL and results):
1) Initial exact-name lookup (no rows returned):
   SQL: SELECT name, goals, "debut year" FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name = 'Diego Milito';
   Result: 0 rows

2) Case-insensitive search by surname (returned one row matching Diego Milito):
   SQL: SELECT name, goals, "debut year", "current club" 
   FROM football_records_in_italy 
   WHERE name ILIKE '%Milito%';
   Result:
   - name: Diego Milito; goals: 86; debut year: 2008; current club: Inter

Assessment:
- The database record for Diego Milito shows goals = 86 and debut year = 2008. This directly supports the claim as stated.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in public.football_records_in_italy.

Assumptions and interpretation:
- Interpreted “debut year” according to the column "debut year" in the football_records_in_italy table (i.e., as defined by this dataset, likely debut in the Italian context covered by the table).
