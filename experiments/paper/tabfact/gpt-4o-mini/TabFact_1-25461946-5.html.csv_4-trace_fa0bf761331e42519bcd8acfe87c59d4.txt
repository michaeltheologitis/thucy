Claim interpreted: “Only 2 games were played on November 27.” We verify this against the available data for the Temple Owls men’s basketball 2009–2010 season.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Summary: public schema containing a single table: t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team (Temple Owls men’s basketball 2009–2010 season)

Table schema consulted
- Table: public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
- The date column stores game dates as text (e.g., “november 27”).

Evidence
1) Identify November dates used in the data (case-insensitive)
- Result: November dates present include: November 14, November 17, November 21, November 24, November 27.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%november%';

2) Count games on November 27 (case-insensitive) and list matches
- Result: 1 row (one game) on November 27.
  - Game: 5
  - Date: November 27
  - Team: Virginia Tech
  - Score: W 61 - 50
  - Location Attendance: Palestra, Philadelphia, PA (3750)
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE LOWER(date) = LOWER('november 27');
- Executed SQL (list rows):
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE LOWER(date) = LOWER('november 27');

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 1 game on November 27 in this dataset, not 2. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence available.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible data source covers the Temple Owls men’s basketball 2009–2010 season and stores dates without years, the claim was interpreted as referring to the number of Temple Owls games played on “November 27” within that season’s schedule. No broader cross-team or cross-sport data is available in the current environment.
