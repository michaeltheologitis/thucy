Summary of claim interpreted
- Claim appears to assert: “Sidney R. Yates of Illinois’s 10th congressional district was elected as an incumbent from the Republican Party in 1964.”

Data sources discovered
- Available authoritative dataset: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (U.S. House elections, year 1974). No 1964 election table is available in the connected data sources.

What the data shows (1974)
1) Sidney R. Yates in 1974
- Finding: Sidney R. Yates appears associated with Illinois’s 9th district as a Democratic incumbent in 1974.
- Evidence query (executed SQL):
  SELECT district, candidates, party, incumbent 
  FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Yates%' OR candidates ILIKE '%sidney r. yates%';
- Evidence result (summary): District: Illinois 9; Candidate: Sidney R. Yates; Party: Democratic; Incumbent: Yes.

2) Illinois’s 10th district in 1974
- Finding: The 1974 election for Illinois’s 10th district lists Abner J. Mikva (D) as winner; the incumbent was Samuel H. Young (R). No mention of Sidney R. Yates in IL-10.
- Evidence query (executed SQL):
  SELECT * 
  FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
  WHERE district = 'illinois 10';
- Evidence result (summary): District: Illinois 10; Candidates: Abner J. Mikva (D) 50.9%, Samuel H. Young (R) 49.1%; Winner: Abner J. Mikva (D); Incumbent: Samuel H. Young (R).

3) Cross-check for Yates in Illinois’s 10th district
- Finding: No row shows Yates in IL-10 (1974).
- Evidence query (executed SQL):
  SELECT district, candidates, party, incumbent 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
  WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Yates%' AND district = 'Illinois 10';
- Evidence result (summary): No rows returned.

Assessment versus the claim
- Party: Available evidence shows Sidney R. Yates as Democratic (1974), which is inconsistent with the claim’s “Republican” characterization. While the dataset does not include 1964, the available evidence contradicts this aspect of the claim.
- District: Available evidence places Sidney R. Yates in Illinois’s 9th district (1974), not the 10th. No evidence ties Yates to IL-10 in the available data.
- Incumbent status in 1964: The dataset does not cover 1964, so we cannot directly verify whether he was an incumbent in that year.

Conclusion
- Based on the accessible authoritative data (1974), key elements of the claim (Republican affiliation and association with Illinois’s 10th district) are inconsistent with the evidence. However, because no 1964 table is available in the connected data sources, we cannot directly confirm or deny the specific 1964 incumbent/election detail from this dataset alone.

Assumptions made for interpretation
- “Illinois 10” is interpreted as Illinois’s 10th congressional district.
- “be elect as incumbent” is interpreted as “was elected (re-elected) as the incumbent.”
- “1964” refers to the 1964 U.S. House general election.
