Claim interpreted: “Game Alert asked for the least amount of money.” I interpret “Game Alert” as the company or product name within the Dragons’ Den UK dataset, and “least amount of money” as the minimum value in the money requested field.

Data environment explored
- Data source discovery: A single PostgreSQL database with one table (public.dragons_den_uk) related to the UK TV show Dragons’ Den.
- Table schema (public.dragons_den_uk): columns include episode (text), first aired (text), entrepreneur (s) (text), company or product name (text), money requested (bigint), investing dragon (s) (text).

Evidence
1) Check for any pitch named “Game Alert”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "company or product name", "money requested" FROM dragons_den_uk WHERE "company or product name" ILIKE '%Game Alert%';
- Result: No rows returned (no pitch with a company or product name containing “Game Alert”).

2) Determine the least amount of money requested and who asked for it
- Executed SQL (minimum requested amount):
  SELECT MIN("money requested") AS min_money_requested FROM public.dragons_den_uk;
- Result: {"min_money_requested": 35000}

- Executed SQL (pitches at the minimum):
  SELECT "episode", "company or product name", "money requested" FROM public.dragons_den_uk WHERE "money requested" = (SELECT MIN("money requested") FROM public.dragons_den_uk);
- Result: [{"company or product name": "youdoodoll", "episode": "episode 2", "money requested": 35000}]

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no pitch named “Game Alert.”
- The least amount of money requested in the dataset is 35,000, by the pitch “youdoodoll” (episode 2), not “Game Alert.”
- Therefore, the claim that “Game Alert asked for the least amount of money” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Game Alert” refers to the company or product name in the Dragons’ Den UK dataset.
- “Least amount of money” is interpreted as the minimum value of the money requested column in public.dragons_den_uk.
