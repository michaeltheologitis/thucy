Claim to verify: "on august 27 remlinger (6 - 6) take the loss as the rockies go to 64 - 70"

Data sources explored:
- Available source: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (Colorado Rockies 1997 season game log table)
- Relevant columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence from the database:
1) Game details for August 27 (1997):
- Result returned: Opponent = Cincinnati Reds; Score = 7-5; Loss = Remlinger (6 - 6); Record = 64 - 70
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date = 'august 27';

Findings:
- The loss field on that date explicitly shows: "Remlinger (6 - 6)" — supporting the claim that Remlinger took the loss and his record became 6-6.
- The record field shows: "64 - 70" — supporting the claim that the Rockies’ overall record moved to 64-70 following the game.
- Context (from the same query): Opponent was the Cincinnati Reds and the score was 7-5 on that date.

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are directly supported by the queried row in the 1997 Colorado Rockies season data.

Assumptions:
- "August 27" refers to the 1997 season date within the available dataset, as this is the only season present in the data source.
- The column "loss" stores the name and record of the losing pitcher for the game, and "record" reflects the Rockies’ cumulative record immediately after that game.
