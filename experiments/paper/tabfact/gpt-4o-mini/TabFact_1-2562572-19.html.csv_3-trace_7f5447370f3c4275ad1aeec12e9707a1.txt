Data source discovery
- Found a single authoritative table: public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina.

Schema overview
- Columns: settlement (text), cyrillic name (text), type (text), population (2011) (bigint), largest ethnic group (2002) (text), dominant religion (2002) (text)
- Relevant metric: population (2011)

Evidence 1: Identify the smallest 2011 population and the settlement(s) with that value
- Result: Settlement = Lok; Type = Village; Population (2011) = 1,114
- Executed SQL:
SELECT settlement, type, "population (2011)" FROM list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE "population (2011)" = (SELECT MIN("population (2011)") FROM list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina);

Evidence 2: Gardinovci’s 2011 population
- Result: Population (2011) = 1,297; Type = village
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "population (2011)", type 
FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina 
WHERE LOWER(settlement) = LOWER('Gardinovci');

Conclusion
- Gardinovci’s population in 2011 (1,297) is greater than the smallest population recorded in the dataset (Lok with 1,114). Therefore, the claim that Gardinovci have the smallest population in 2011 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to settlements within the Vojvodina dataset represented by public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina.
- “Smallest population in 2011” is interpreted using the column population (2011).
