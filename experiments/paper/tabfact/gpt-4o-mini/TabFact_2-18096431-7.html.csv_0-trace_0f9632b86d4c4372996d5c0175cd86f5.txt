Scope and data source
- Available dataset: public.t_1996_pga_championship (1996 PGA Championship results). Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text), money (bigint).

Evidence
1) Top earners in the dataset
- SQL executed: SELECT player, money FROM t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY money DESC LIMIT 5;
- Result (top 5):
  1. Mark Brooks — 430000
  2. Kenny Perry — 260000
  3. Steve Elkington — 140000
  4. Tommy Tolles — 140000
  5. Justin Leonard — 86667

2) Confirming the maximum prize money and who earned it
- SQL executed: SELECT MAX(money) AS max_money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship;
- Result: 430000
- SQL executed: SELECT player, money, place FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE money = 430000;
- Result: player = mark brooks, money = 430000, place = 1

Conclusion
- The data shows Mark Brooks earned the most prize money in this event ($430,000). The claim uses the name “mark brook,” which appears to be a misspelling of Mark Brooks, but the substantive claim (that he earned the most money) is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to prize money within the 1996 PGA Championship dataset (the only available data source).
- “mark brook” refers to professional golfer Mark Brooks.
