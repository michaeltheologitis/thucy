Scope and data sources explored:
- Discovered 1 accessible data source: PostgreSQL table public.cities_of_the_underworld (a dataset for the TV series “Cities of the Underworld”). No other databases were found.
- Table schema: columns — "production no" (bigint), "episode no" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "episode title" (text), "host" (text).

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Check the record for episode number 213
SQL executed:
SELECT "episode no", "production no", "episode title", "original airdate", "host" 
FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld 
WHERE "episode no" = 213;
Result:
- Episode No: 213
- Production No: 27
- Episode Title: Secret Soviet Bases
- Original Airdate: May 5, 2008
- Host: Don Wildman
Interpretation: In this dataset, episode 213 aired on May 5, 2008, not January 28, 2008.

2) Check for any episode with original airdate January 28, 2008 (various text formats)
SQL executed:
A. Exact matches:
SELECT "episode no", "episode title", "original airdate" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld 
WHERE "original airdate" IN ('January 28, 2008', 'Jan 28, 2008', '2008-01-28');
B. LIKE-based search:
SELECT "episode no", "episode title", "original airdate" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld 
WHERE "original airdate" LIKE '%January 28, 2008%' OR 
      "original airdate" LIKE '%Jan 28, 2008%' OR 
      "original airdate" LIKE '%2008-01-28%';
C. Direct equality ORs:
SELECT "episode no", "episode title", "original airdate" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld 
WHERE "original airdate" = 'January 28, 2008' OR 
      "original airdate" = 'Jan 28, 2008' OR 
      "original airdate" = '2008-01-28';
Results: No records found for January 28, 2008 in any tested format.

Conclusion:
- According to the available authoritative dataset for Cities of the Underworld, episode number 213 did not air on January 28, 2008; it aired on May 5, 2008. No episode in the dataset is listed with an original airdate of January 28, 2008.

Assumptions:
- Because only the Cities of the Underworld dataset is accessible, the claim is interpreted as referring to episode numbering within this series.
