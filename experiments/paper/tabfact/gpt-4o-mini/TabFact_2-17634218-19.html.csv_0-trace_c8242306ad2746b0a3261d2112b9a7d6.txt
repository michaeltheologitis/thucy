Claim interpreted: The table has only two distinct values in the column named "highest rank" (i.e., only two highest-rank categories appear in the table).

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table (public schema): list_of_sumo_record_holders
- Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Count of distinct non-null values in "highest rank"
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "highest rank") AS distinct_count
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE "highest rank" IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- distinct_count = 2

2) Distinct values of "highest rank" with their frequencies
SQL:
SELECT "highest rank", COUNT(*) AS frequency
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE "highest rank" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY "highest rank"
ORDER BY frequency DESC, "highest rank";
Results:
- ōzeki: 6
- sekiwake: 6

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 2 distinct values present in the "highest rank" column of public.list_of_sumo_record_holders. This supports the claim that there are only two "highest rank" entries/categories represented in the table.

Assumptions
- I interpret “there be only 2 highest rank list in the table” to mean there are exactly two distinct values in the column named "highest rank" within the identified table. If the intent was different (e.g., number of rows sharing the maximum of a numeric rank), the current table’s "highest rank" is textual, and the above interpretation is the most reasonable given the schema.
