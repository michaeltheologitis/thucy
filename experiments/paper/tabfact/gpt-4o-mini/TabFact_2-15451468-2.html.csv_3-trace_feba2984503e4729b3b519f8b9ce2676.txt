Summary of data sources explored
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, public schema, table t_1970_new_york_giants_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance). This table contains game-by-game records (including attendance) for the New York Giants’ 1970 season.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Determine the highest attendance recorded in the dataset
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season;
- Result: 69,126

2) Retrieve the game(s) corresponding to the maximum attendance
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance
  FROM t_1970_new_york_giants_season
  WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM t_1970_new_york_giants_season);
- Result:
  Week: 3; Date: 1970-10-04; Opponent: New Orleans Saints; Result: L 14 - 10; Game Site: Tulane Stadium; Attendance: 69,126

3) Check whether an attendance of 62,936 appears and, if so, its context
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season WHERE attendance = 62936;
- Result:
  Week: 1; Date: 1970-09-19; Opponent: Chicago Bears; Game Site: Yankee Stadium; Result: Loss (24 - 16); Attendance: 62,936

Conclusion
- The highest attendance in the available dataset is 69,126 (Week 3 vs. New Orleans Saints at Tulane Stadium). While an attendance of 62,936 does appear (Week 1 vs. Chicago Bears), it is not the maximum.

Assumptions
- “for the whole week” was interpreted as “for the entire season (across all weeks) in the accessible dataset (1970 New York Giants games).” No league-wide attendance data for other teams’ games is available in the connected data source, so verification is constrained to Giants games only.
