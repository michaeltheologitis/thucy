Claim interpreted: “There is a 4‑way tie for the most laps at 75, with a 2‑way tie for the least at 7.” I interpret “most lap” as the maximum number of laps completed by any driver, and “least amount” as the minimum laps completed by any driver in the available race dataset.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (1971 South African Grand Prix)
  - Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence 1: Maximum laps value and how many drivers achieved it
- Result: Max laps = 79; 4 drivers achieved this.
- SQL (max laps): SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- SQL (count at max): SELECT COUNT(driver) AS driver_count FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = (SELECT MAX(laps) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
- SQL (drivers at max):
  SELECT driver, SUM(laps) AS total_laps
  FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
  GROUP BY driver
  HAVING SUM(laps) = (
    SELECT MAX(total_laps)
    FROM (
      SELECT SUM(laps) AS total_laps
      FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
      GROUP BY driver
    ) AS lap_counts
  );
- Drivers with 79 laps: Clay Regazzoni, Jackie Stewart, Mario Andretti, Reine Wisell.

Evidence 2: Check whether “75 laps” is the maximum and its tie count
- Result: 75 laps occurred for 1 driver (not the maximum).
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = 75;
- SQL (who): SELECT driver FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = 75;
- Driver with 75 laps: Andrea de Adamich.

Evidence 3: Minimum laps value and how many drivers had it
- Result: Min laps = 5; 2 drivers had this minimum.
- SQL (min laps): SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
- SQL (drivers at min): SELECT driver, laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = 5;
- Drivers with 5 laps: Jo Bonnier; Alex Soler - Roig.

Evidence 4: Check whether “7 laps” is the least and its tie count
- Result: 7 laps is not the minimum; only 1 driver had 7 laps.
- SQL (count at 7): SELECT COUNT(*) AS driver_count FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = 7;
- SQL (who at 7): SELECT driver FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix WHERE laps = 7;
- Driver with 7 laps: Peter Gethin.

Assessment of the claim:
- “4 way tie for the most lap at 75” — Inaccurate. There is a 4‑way tie, but it is at 79 laps, not 75.
- “2 way tie for the least amount at 7” — Inaccurate. The least is 5 laps (not 7), and there is indeed a 2‑way tie but at 5 laps.

Conclusion: The dataset shows a 4‑way tie at 79 (not 75) and a 2‑way tie at 5 (not 7). Therefore, the claim mixes incorrect lap values with partially correct tie counts.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to laps completed by drivers in the only available dataset: the 1971 South African Grand Prix (public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix).
- “Most lap” means the maximum laps completed by any driver; “least amount” means the minimum laps completed by any driver.
