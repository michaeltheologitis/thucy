- Data source explored: public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season (1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics game-by-game table with fields including date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, and record).

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with one table public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season (Seattle SuperSonics 1991–92 season).

Schema details
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate the row where the team record is 34-27 (ignoring spaces):
SQL:
SELECT date, team, score, "high assists", record FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE REPLACE(record, ' ', '') = '34-27';
Result (as returned by the query tool): On March 7 vs. New Jersey Nets, the Seattle SuperSonics won 109–98; high assists were by N. McMillan with 7; record at that time was 34-27.

2) Confirm the number of rows matching that record:
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE REPLACE(record, ' ', '') = '34-27';
Result: 1 row.

3) Retrieve the full row for completeness:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE REPLACE(record, ' ', '') = '34-27';
Result (summary from tool): Seattle vs. New Jersey Nets on March 7, win 109–98; record 34-27; high assists by N. McMillan was 7.

Conclusion
- The data shows that when the record was 34-27, the high assists leader was N. (Nate) McMillan with 7. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics dataset in the available database and to the single game state where the team’s record stood at 34-27.
- “7 high assist by n mcmillan” is interpreted as the game high assists being 7, recorded by N. McMillan.
