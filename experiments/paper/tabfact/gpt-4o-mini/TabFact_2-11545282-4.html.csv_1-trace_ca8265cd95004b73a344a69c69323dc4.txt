What I checked
- Interpreted claim: The user asserts that Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz seven years before Darryl Dawkins did.
- Approach: Identify authoritative roster records for the Utah Jazz, look up both players, and compare the years listed for each player.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a public table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (owner: guest_user)

Schema details consulted
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), "years for jazz" (text), "school / club team" (text)

Evidence queries and results
1) Find all Jazz roster entries with the surname “Dawkins”
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, "years for jazz" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Dawkins%';

Result rows:
- darryl dawkins | 1987 - 88
- paul dawkins   | 1979 - 80

Analysis
- According to the roster data:
  - Paul Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz in the 1979–80 season.
  - Darryl Dawkins played for the Utah Jazz in the 1987–88 season.
- Time gap interpretations:
  - By start year: 1987 (Darryl) − 1979 (Paul) = 8 years.
  - From Paul’s end season year to Darryl’s start season year: 1987 − 1980 = 7 years.

Conclusion
- The core idea—that Paul Dawkins played for the Jazz before Darryl Dawkins—is supported by the data.
- The exact “7 years” figure depends on how the gap is measured. If comparing season starts, it is 8 years. If comparing Paul’s last season year (1980) to Darryl’s first season year (1987), it is 7 years.

Final assessment
- The statement is directionally correct (Paul played earlier), but the specific “7 years” is only correct under one interpretation of the boundary years and not by the more common start-to-start comparison.

Assumptions made
- “Played … 7 years before” was interpreted as a comparison of their tenures with the Jazz. Because the phrasing is ambiguous, I evaluated both start-to-start and end-to-start gaps.
