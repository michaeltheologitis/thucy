Claim to verify: "the tv series dexter have 11 episode in its third season"

Data source discovery:
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: dexter_season_3 (episodes information for Dexter Season 3).

Schema details (from the database):
- Table: dexter_season_3
  - Columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text)
  - No explicit primary key or constraints.

Evidence gathered:
1) Total number of rows (episodes) in dexter_season_3
- Result: 10
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.dexter_season_3;

2) Count of distinct episode numbers within the season
- Result: 10 distinct values of "no in season"
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "no in season") AS distinct_no_in_season_count FROM public.dexter_season_3;

3) Maximum episode number within the season
- Result: max("no in season") = 11
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX("no in season") AS max_no_in_season FROM public.dexter_season_3;

4) Full listing of episodes by in-season number
- Result (ordered by "no in season"): 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 (10 total; note missing 9)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title FROM dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season" ASC;

Analysis:
- The database lists 10 episodes for Dexter Season 3. While the maximum in-season number present is 11, the set of episode numbers contains only 10 distinct entries (1–8, 10, 11). Therefore, based on the authoritative dataset accessible here, the season does not have 11 episodes recorded; it has 10 entries.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Dexter’s third season has 11 episodes is not supported by the data; the table records 10 episodes.

Assumptions made:
- The table dexter_season_3 is intended to represent the complete list of episodes for Dexter Season 3 within this data environment, and the count of rows corresponds to the number of episodes.
