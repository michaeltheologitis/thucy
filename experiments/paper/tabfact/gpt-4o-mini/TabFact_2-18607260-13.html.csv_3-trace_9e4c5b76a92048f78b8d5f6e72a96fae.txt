Claim interpreted: “Neither team scored for the first 2 game of the World Cup in France.” Given the available data source (1998 in Paraguayan football), I interpret this as referring to Paraguay’s first two matches at the 1998 FIFA World Cup hosted by France. “Neither team scored” is taken to mean the matches ended 0–0.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: a PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football (columns: date, venue, score, comp, report).

Step 1: Identify competitions present
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT comp FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football;
Result (as reported by the tool): World Cup, Kirin Cup, F

Normalization check for comp values
Executed SQL:
SELECT TRIM(comp) AS trimmed_comp, COUNT(*) AS count 
FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football 
GROUP BY trimmed_comp;
Result: world cup (4), kirin cup (2), f (8)

Step 2: Retrieve all World Cup matches and order by date
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, report 
FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football 
WHERE TRIM(LOWER(comp)) = 'world cup' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
Returned rows:
1) 1998 - 06 - 12 | Stade de la Mosson Montpellier, France | 0 - 0 | report
2) 1998 - 06 - 19 | Stade Geoffroy - Guichard Saint - Étienne, France | 0 - 0 | report
3) 1998 - 06 - 24 | Stade de Toulouse Toulouse, France | 1 - 3 | report
4) 1998 - 06 - 28 | Stade Félix Bollaert Lens, France | 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet) | report

Step 3: Explicitly fetch the first two World Cup matches
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE TRIM(LOWER(comp)) = 'world cup' ORDER BY date ASC LIMIT 2;
Results:
- 1998-06-12 | Stade de la Mosson, Montpellier, France | 0 - 0
- 1998-06-19 | Stade Geoffroy-Guichard, Saint-Étienne, France | 0 - 0

Conclusion grounded in data:
- The first two World Cup matches in France (per the Paraguay 1998 dataset) both ended 0–0. Therefore, “neither team scored for the first 2 game” is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “World Cup in France” refers to the 1998 FIFA World Cup hosted by France.
- The claim pertains to Paraguay’s matches (since the only available data source is specific to Paraguayan football in 1998).
- “Neither team scored” means the final scoreline was 0–0 (no goals in regular time).
