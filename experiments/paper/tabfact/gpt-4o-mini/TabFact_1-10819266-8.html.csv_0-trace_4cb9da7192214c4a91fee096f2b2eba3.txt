- Relevant table: csi_franchise (contains season-level details including “season finale” dates)

Evidence
1) Query: Retrieve season and season finale for season 4
SQL executed:
SELECT season, "season finale" FROM csi_franchise WHERE season = 4;
Result (as returned by the tool): The season finale date for season 4 of the CSI franchise is May 21, 2008.

2) Query: Retrieve raw value of the season finale field for season 4

SELECT "season finale" FROM csi_franchise WHERE season = 4;
Result (as returned by the tool): "may 21 , 2008"

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists the season 4 “season finale” as "may 21 , 2008", which matches the claim’s date.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the csi_franchise table of the TabFact database.

Assumptions
