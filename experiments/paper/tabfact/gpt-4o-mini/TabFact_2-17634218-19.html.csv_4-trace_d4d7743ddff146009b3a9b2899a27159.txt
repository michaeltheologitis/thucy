Claim to verify: “the last record for both the highest totalling name and the lowest totalling name be record in the month of september.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Available table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders

Schema inspection
- Table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  - Columns: name (text), total (bigint), first (text), last (text), "highest rank" (text)
  - No date/datetime columns; the fields first and last are textual month-year values (e.g., “september 1999”).

Exploratory sample (to understand typical values)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders LIMIT 20;
- Sample values observed include entries like:
  - kotonishiki | total=34 | last="september 1999"
  - daikirin | total=22 | last="september 1970"
  - tochiazuma ii | total=22 | last="january 2005"
  - kisenosato | total=22 | last="september 2011"

Step 1: Identify the highest and lowest totals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(total) AS min_total FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
  Result: 22

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(total) AS max_total FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
  Result: 34

Step 2: Retrieve names having the min or max total and check if their last field is in September
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, total, last, (last LIKE '%september%') AS is_september
  FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  WHERE total = 22 OR total = 34;

- Results from the above query:
  - Highest total (34):
    - kotonishiki | last = "september 1999" | is_september = true
  - Lowest total (22):
    - daikirin | last = "september 1970" | is_september = true
    - tochiazuma ii | last = "january 2005" | is_september = false
    - kisenosato | last = "september 2011" | is_september = true

Assessment
- The highest totalling name is kotonishiki (total = 34). Its last record is in September ("september 1999"). This supports the claim for the highest totalling name.
- The lowest totalling value is 22, and multiple names share this minimum (daikirin, tochiazuma ii, kisenosato). Among these:
  - daikirin and kisenosato have last records in September.
  - tochiazuma ii has the last record in January, not September.
- Therefore, if we interpret “the lowest totalling name” to include all names tied at the minimum total, the statement is not universally true: at least one lowest-totalling name does not have its last record in September.

Conclusion
- Highest totalling name: last record is in September (true).
- Lowest totalling name(s): not all have last record in September (false for at least one). The overall claim does not fully hold.

Assumptions
- “Totalling name” refers to the name(s) with the maximum/minimum value of the total column.
- “Last record … in the month of September” is interpreted as the last column’s month string containing “september”.
- In case of ties for minimum total, all tied names are considered under “the lowest totalling name.”
