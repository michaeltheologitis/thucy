Summary conclusion
- The data shows that Takamiyama has the longest time span between his first and last record in the available table. The exact span is 12 years and 10 months (approximately 13 years), not a full 13 years.

What data I checked
1) Located the relevant data source and table
- Discovered the available database and table.
  SQL (executed by tool):
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'list_of_sumo_record_holders';

- Result (abridged):
  Columns: total (bigint), name (text), first (text), last (text), highest rank (text)

- Sample rows to confirm content and format:
  SQL (executed by tool):
  SELECT * 
  FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders 
  LIMIT 20;

  Example rows returned:
  - name: takamiyama | first: november 1969 | last: september 1982
  - name: akinoshima | first: november 1988 | last: september 2000
  - name: kotonishiki | first: september 1990 | last: september 1999
  (and others)

2) Computed the time spans and ranked them
- To determine who has the longest span, I ordered all rows by the interval between last and first.
  SQL (executed by tool):
  SELECT name, first, last, 
         AGE(TO_DATE(last, 'Month YYYY'), TO_DATE(first, 'Month YYYY')) AS age 
  FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders 
  ORDER BY age DESC 
  LIMIT 10;

- Top results returned (abridged):
  1) Takamiyama — First: November 1969, Last: September 1982 — Span: 12 years, 10 months (154 months)
  2) Akinoshima — First: November 1988, Last: September 2000 — Span: 11 years, 10 months
  3) Kotonishiki — First: September 1990, Last: September 1999 — Span: 9 years
  (others shorter)

Assessment of the claim
- “Takamiyama have the longest time range between his first and last record”: Supported by the ordered results—Takamiyama appears first when sorting by span descending.
- “13 year”: The computed interval for Takamiyama is 12 years and 10 months. This is approximately 13 years but is not a full 13 years.

Final answer
- Longest holder: Yes, Takamiyama has the longest span.
- Duration: 12 years 10 months (~13 years), not exactly 13 years.

Assumptions
- “Record” refers to entries captured in the table public.list_of_sumo_record_holders, with “first” and “last” being the earliest and latest month-year in which the person held/achieved the relevant record category.
- Month-year strings were parsed as dates on the first day of the month to compute spans.
- The longest span is evaluated within the scope of this table only.
