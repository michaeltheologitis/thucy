Claim to verify: "na win the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998"

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: ned_kelly_awards (columns: year, "best teenage / young adult", "reader's vote", "best non-fiction", "lifetime achievement")

Schema evidence
- Discovered table and columns:
  - ned_kelly_awards: year (bigint), "lifetime achievement" (text), plus other award-category columns.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) List all years with their Lifetime Achievement entries
SQL:
SELECT year, "lifetime achievement" FROM ned_kelly_awards ORDER BY year ASC;
Result (excerpt):
- 1996 | Jon Cleary
- 1997 | Alan Yates (aka Carter Brown)
- 1998 | NA
- 1999 | Peter Corris
- 2000 | NA
- 2001 | Professor Stephen Knight
- 2002 | Patrick Gallagher
- 2003 | Kerry Greenwood
- 2004 | Bob Bottom
- 2005 | Stuart Coupe
- 2006 | Andrew Rule and John Silvester
- 2007 | Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson
- 2008 | Marele Day
- 2009 | Shane Maloney
- 2010 | Peter Doyle
- 2011 | NA

2) Distinct values present in the Lifetime Achievement column
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "lifetime achievement" FROM public.ned_kelly_awards;
Result (includes): NA, Jon Cleary, Alan Yates (aka Carter Brown), Peter Corris, Professor Stephen Knight, Patrick Gallagher, Kerry Greenwood, Bob Bottom, Stuart Coupe, Andrew Rule and John Silvester, Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day, Shane Maloney, Peter Doyle.

Assessment
- The Lifetime Achievement entry is "NA" in multiple years: 1998, 2000, and 2011.
- Because "NA" appears in 1998 (which is not after 1998), the statement that "na win the lifetime achievement only after the year 1998" is false.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows an "NA" entry at 1998 itself, contradicting "only after 1998".

Assumptions
- Interpreted "na" as the literal value "NA" in the Lifetime Achievement column (commonly indicating no award or not available). If instead "na" refers to a person named "Na", there is no such winner listed in the data; thus the claim still does not hold.
