Claim to verify: “Nadia Al‑Moutawaa [was] the first person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games and [she also] won silver another year.”

Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL database with one table: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games (columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze). No related tables or keys.

What the data shows
1) Earliest recorded equestrian gold medalist in the dataset
- Result: The earliest year in the table is 1982, and the gold medalist for that year is Nadia Al‑Moutawaa (location: New Delhi).
- Supporting SQL and results:
  - SQL: SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_year FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
    - Result: 1982
  - SQL: SELECT location, gold FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year = 1982;
    - Result: location = New Delhi, gold = Nadia Al‑Moutawaa

2) Presence of Nadia Al‑Moutawaa (or close variants) in other years, especially as a silver medalist
- Result: The only occurrence of “Nadia” in gold/silver is in 1982 (gold). There are no other years showing Nadia Al‑Moutawaa (or close surname variants) as a silver medalist.
- Supporting SQL and results:
  - SQL: SELECT year, location, gold, silver 
    FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
    WHERE gold ILIKE '%Nadia%' OR silver ILIKE '%Nadia%';
    - Result: 1982 | New Delhi | gold = Nadia Al - Moutawaa | silver = Jamila Al - Moutawaa
  - SQL: SELECT year, location, gold, silver FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games 
    WHERE gold ILIKE '%Moutaw%' OR gold ILIKE '%Mutaw%' OR gold ILIKE '%Motaw%'
       OR silver ILIKE '%Moutaw%' OR silver ILIKE '%Mutaw%' OR silver ILIKE '%Motaw%';
    - Result: 1982 | New Delhi | gold = Nadia Al - Moutawaa | silver = Jamila Al - Moutawaa

3) Full table context (to verify earliest year and scan names)
- Summary of rows returned when sorted by year:
  - 1982 | New Delhi | Gold: Nadia Al‑Moutawaa | Silver: Jamila Al‑Moutawaa | Bronze: Bariaa Salem Al‑Sabbah

- Supporting SQL:
  - SQL: SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;

Assessment of the claim
- “First person to win the gold medal in equestrian at the Asian Games”: Supported within this dataset. The earliest year recorded is 1982, with gold awarded to Nadia Al‑Moutawaa.
- “and win silver another year”: Not supported. No subsequent entry shows Nadia Al‑Moutawaa (or close variants) as a silver medalist in other years.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes one supported element (first recorded gold in this dataset) with an unsupported element (also winning silver another year). Therefore, the overall claim is not fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- The table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games represents the authoritative record of Asian Games equestrian medalists available to us. If multiple equestrian events exist, this table reflects the event(s) intended by the data provider.
- Name matching relied on exact and approximate text searches (e.g., Nadia, Moutaw/Mutaw/Motaw). No additional alias tables were available.
