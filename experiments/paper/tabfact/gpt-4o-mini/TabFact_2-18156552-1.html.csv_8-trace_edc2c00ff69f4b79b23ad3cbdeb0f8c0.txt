Claim to verify: "ngc 2082 have a deeper declination (or dec) of °59′28″, than any other galaxy in the Dorado group."

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with schema public and table dorado_group

Schema examined
- Table: public.dorado_group
  - Columns: name (text), type (text), "ra ( j2000 )" (text), "dec ( j2000 )" (text), "redshift (km / s )" (text), "apparent magnitude" (double precision)

Evidence gathered
1) Quick browse of objects in the Dorado Group
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )", "dec ( j2000 )" FROM public.dorado_group LIMIT 20;
Key returned rows (excerpt):
- ngc 2082 | 05h41 m51.1s | degree18′04″
- ngc 1574 | 04h21 m58.8s | degree58′29″
- ngc 1566 | 04h20 m00.4s | degree56′16″
- ngc 1553 | 04h16 m10.5s | degree46′49″
- ngc 1549 | 04h15 m45.1s | degree35′32″

2) Full row for NGC 2082
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 2082';
Returned:
- Name: ngc 2082; Type: sab (rs + ) c; RA (J2000): 05h41 m51.1s; Dec (J2000): degree18′04″; Redshift (km/s): 1184 ± 6; Apparent Magnitude: 12.6

3) All Declinations in the Dorado Group table
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "dec ( j2000 )" FROM public.dorado_group;
Returned Dec (J2000) values include:
- ngc 2082: degree18′04″
- ngc 1574: degree58′29″
- ngc 1566: degree56′16″
- ngc 1553: degree46′49″
- ngc 1549: degree35′32″
- ngc 1947: degree45′36″
- ngc 1796: degree08′24″
- ngc 1688: degree48′01″
- ngc 1672: degree14′50″
- ic 2056: degree12′25″
- ngc 1559: degree47′01″
- ngc 1543: degree44′17″
- ngc 1533: degree07′06″
- ngc 1617: degree36′08″
- ngc 1515: degree06′00″
- ngc 1705: degree21′40″
- ngc 1596: degree01′40″

Findings
- The database lists NGC 2082 with Dec (J2000) shown as "degree18′04″" (minutes and seconds explicitly shown as 18′04″). There is no entry of 59′28″ for NGC 2082.
- Among objects in the Dorado Group table, several have larger arcminutes than NGC 2082 (e.g., NGC 1574 has 58′29″). Therefore, even considering only the minutes/seconds portion visible in this dataset, NGC 2082 does not have the most extreme ("deepest") declination compared to others.

Conclusion
- The specific value claimed for NGC 2082 (°59′28″) is contradicted by the dataset, which shows 18′04″ (minutes and seconds) for its declination string. Additionally, the claim that it is deeper than any other Dorado Group galaxy is not supported by the data; other galaxies show larger arcminute values.

Assumptions and notes
- "Deeper declination" is interpreted as more southerly (more negative) declination. The declination strings in this dataset appear to omit the degree value and sign, displaying only a literal "degree" followed by arcminutes and arcseconds (e.g., "degree18′04″"). Despite this formatting limitation, the claim’s specific minutes/seconds (59′28″) for NGC 2082 is directly contradicted by the stored value (18′04″), and the comparative superlative is not supported by the available values.
