Summary
The claim states: there are 3,624,000 live births per year in the period where female life expectancy is 73.3. Using the available TabFact database (public.my_info_table), I verified that there is a record for the period 1995 - 2000 with life expectancy (females) = 73.3 and live births per year = 3,624,000, which supports the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with schema public and table my_info_table containing demographic fields including period, live births per year, and life expectancy females.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify records near 73.3 female life expectancy
SQL:
SELECT period, "life expectancy females", "live births per year"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE "life expectancy females" BETWEEN 73.0 AND 74.0;

Result returned by the tool:
- Period: 1995 - 2000; Life Expectancy Females: 73.3; Live Births Per Year: 3,624,000

2) Confirm exact 73.3 female life expectancy and associated live births
SQL:
SELECT period, "life expectancy females", "live births per year"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE "life expectancy females"::double precision = 73.3;

Result returned by the tool:
- Period: 1995 - 2000; Life Expectancy Females: 73.3; Live Births Per Year: 3,624,000

Conclusion
Both queries independently show that during the period 1995 - 2000, the female life expectancy is 73.3 and the live births per year figure is 3,624,000. This directly supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the dataset represented by TabFact.public.my_info_table.
- “Live birth(s) per year” corresponds to the column "live births per year" in that table.
- “Period” corresponds to the text label in the column period (e.g., 1995 - 2000).
