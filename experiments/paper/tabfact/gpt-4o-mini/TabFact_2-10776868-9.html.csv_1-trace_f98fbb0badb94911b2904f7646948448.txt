Summary
- Based on the available 1962 VFL season data (6 matches on 23 June 1962), the Carlton vs Footscray game in this dataset was played at Princes Park.
- Note on spelling: the venue in the data is “Princes Park” (commonly spelled without the second “s”), while the claim says “princess park.”

Evidence from the database
1) Table structure and sample rows
- Columns and data types retrieved via:
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1962_vfl_season';
- First rows (confirms presence of the Carlton vs Footscray match and venue field):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season LIMIT 10;

Excerpt from returned rows included:
| away team | away team score | crowd | date           | home team | home team score | venue         |
| footscray | 9.10 (64)       | 32400 | 23 june 1962   | carlton   | 12.9 (81)       | princes park  |

2) Direct verification of Carlton vs Footscray match and venue
SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue 
FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season 
WHERE ("home team" = 'carlton' AND "away team" = 'footscray') 
   OR ("home team" = 'footscray' AND "away team" = 'carlton');

Result:
- Date: 23 June 1962; Home team: carlton; Away team: footscray; Venue: princes park.

3) Context on dataset coverage (to understand scope)
- Row count and distinct dates show the table contains one round (6 matches) on a single date:
SQL (row count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
SQL (distinct dates):
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Results: 6 rows; distinct date: 23 June 1962.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows the Carlton vs Footscray match in this dataset (23 June 1962) was played at Princes Park. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Carlton–Footscray game represented in the available 1962 dataset (23 June 1962). The dataset contains only that single round; broader historical verification beyond this dataset is out of scope here.
