Claim: "in 1996, the southeast region have a record of 24 - 9"

Data source explored: PostgreSQL database with table public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (columns: year, record, seed, region, results).

Evidence:
- Query 1 (season overview)
  SQL: SELECT year, region, record FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1996;
  Result: year = 1996, region = "Southeast", record = "24 - 9"

- Query 2 (full row confirmation)
  SQL: SELECT * FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1996;
  Result: year = 1996; record = "24 - 9"; seed = 12; region = "Southeast"; results = "Lost 51 - 58."

Assessment:
- The 1996 entry in the dataset has region = Southeast and record = 24 - 9. This directly supports the claim as phrased.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the VCU Rams men’s basketball 1996 season in the available dataset, where "southeast region" corresponds to the "region" field for that season.
