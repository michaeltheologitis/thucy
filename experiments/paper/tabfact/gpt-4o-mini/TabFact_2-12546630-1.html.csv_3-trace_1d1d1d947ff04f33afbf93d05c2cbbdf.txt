Claim to verify: "Ettore Meini won 2 races in a row, on May 24 and 25, during the 1933 Giro d'Italia."

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.t_1933_giro_d_italia
- Columns: date (text), course (text), distance (text), winner (text), race leader (text)

Evidence retrieved
1) Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1933_giro_d_italia;

Observed relevant rows in the result set:
- 24 may | ferrara to udine | - | race leader: alfredo binda ( ita ) | winner: ettore meini ( ita )
- 25 may | udine to bassano del grappa | - | race leader: alfredo binda ( ita ) | winner: ettore meini ( ita )

Additional context from the same query output shows 23 may is a rest day, then 24 may and 25 may are consecutive race stages, both won by Ettore Meini, confirming two consecutive stage wins on those dates within the 1933 Giro d'Italia.

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists Ettore Meini as the winner on 24 May and 25 May, back-to-back.
- Therefore, the claim that he won two races in a row on those dates during the 1933 Giro d'Italia is supported.

Assumptions
- "Race" refers to individual stages of the Giro d'Italia.
- Dates are interpreted as calendar dates in May 1933, matching the table entries (e.g., "24 may", "25 may").
