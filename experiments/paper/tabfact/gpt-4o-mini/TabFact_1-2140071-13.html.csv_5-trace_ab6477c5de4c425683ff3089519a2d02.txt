Claim assessed: “brian patacca be the coach for episode 1 of season 13.”

Data source consulted: TabFact database, public.made_tv_series (authoritative within this environment).

Step 1 — Identify the coach for Season 13, Episode 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT coach, "episode summary", "premier date", "external link" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE season = 13 AND episode = 1;
- Result:
  - Coach: Nikki Deloach
  - Episode Summary: Cara is made into an actress
  - Premier Date: June 18, 2012
  - External Link: Full episode

Finding: Season 13, Episode 1 lists Nikki Deloach—not Brian Patacca—as the coach.

Step 2 — Check whether Brian Patacca appears as a coach elsewhere in Season 13
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, episode, "episode summary" FROM public.made_tv_series WHERE LOWER(coach) = LOWER('Brian Patacca');
- Result:
  - Season: 13
  - Episode: 14
  - Episode Summary: emilly and jeanette are made into actresses

Finding: Brian Patacca is recorded as the coach for Season 13, Episode 14, not Episode 1.
