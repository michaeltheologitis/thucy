Scope and data source discovered:
- Available database: public schema with a single table: t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season (Manchester United 2005–06 season). Columns: date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text).

Step 1: Identify the attendance for the Arsenal match on 9 April 2006
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponents, attendance FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Arsenal%';
- Evidence (results):
  • Date: 3 January 2006 | Opponents: Arsenal | Attendance: 38,313
  • Date: 9 April 2006   | Opponents: Arsenal | Attendance: 70,908
- Conclusion from Step 1: The attendance for the Arsenal match on 9 April 2006 was 70,908.

Step 2: Count matches on or after 13 August 2005 with attendance exactly equal to 70,908
- Executed SQL to find the reference attendance explicitly:
  SELECT attendance FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE date = '9 April 2006' AND opponents = 'Arsenal';
- Executed SQL to list matching matches (inclusive since 13 Aug 2005, parsing text dates):
  SELECT date, opponents, attendance FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') >= '2005-08-13' AND attendance = 70908;
- Executed SQL to count matching matches:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE to_date(date, 'FMDD FMMonth YYYY') >= '2005-08-13' AND attendance = 70908;
- Evidence (results):
  • Matching rows listed: Date: 9 April 2006 | Opponent: Arsenal | Attendance: 70,908
  • Count: 1

Overall conclusion:
- The data shows only 1 match on or after 13 August 2005 with attendance exactly equal to the Arsenal match on 9 April 2006 (and that one match is the Arsenal match itself). This directly contradicts the claim that there have been 19 such games.

Assumptions and interpretation:
- “Games” is interpreted as Manchester United first-team matches in the 2005–06 season, as represented in the only available data table.
- “Since 13 August 2005” is treated as inclusive (on or after 13 August 2005).
- Equality of attendance is exact numeric equality.
- All conclusions are strictly grounded in the available dataset; no external competitions or teams beyond what is recorded in the table are included.
