Claim interpreted: “there be fewer win result than loss result.” I interpret this as: In the available dataset, the count of Win results is less than the count of Loss results.

Data source explored: PostgreSQL database, schema public, table tim_lajcik. Relevant column: res (text) capturing fight result (e.g., Win/Loss/Draw/NC).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Distribution of results
SQL:
SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.tim_lajcik
GROUP BY res
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- Win: 7
- Loss: 6
- Draw: 1

2) Explicit case-insensitive counts for Win vs Loss
SQL (wins):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE LOWER(res) = 'win';
Result: 7

SQL (losses):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE LOWER(res) = 'loss';
Result: 6

Conclusion: The dataset shows more wins (7) than losses (6). Therefore, the claim that there are fewer win results than loss results is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “result” refers to the res column in public.tim_lajcik.
- The comparison is strictly between counts of Win and Loss, ignoring other categories like Draw or NC.
