Summary of finding:
- Based on the available dataset for Galina Voskoboeva, 40% of her matches were played on clay surfaces, not 20%.

Evidence from data:
1) Distinct surface values and counts
- Result:
  - hard (i): 2
  - hard: 1
  - clay: 2
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count FROM galina_voskoboeva GROUP BY surface;

2) Aggregate calculation of clay share (single query)
- Result:
  - total_matches: 5
  - clay_matches: 2
  - clay_percentage: 40.00
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches,
         SUM(CASE WHEN surface ILIKE 'clay%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS clay_matches,
         ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN surface ILIKE 'clay%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) AS clay_percentage
  FROM galina_voskoboeva;

Conclusion:
- The data show 40% of matches on clay, which contradicts the claim of 20%.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “play 20% of her game” as “20% of her matches.”
- Interpreted “clay top tennis court” as the clay surface category.
- Calculations are over all matches present in the galina_voskoboeva table, treated as the authoritative dataset available.
