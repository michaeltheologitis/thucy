Summary of verification
- Interpreted claim in context of the available data source (2010 Vuelta a España table) where “mountains classification” denotes the jersey holder after each stage. The claim states: “besides mickaël delage, there be only 1 other winner in the mountain classification.” That implies only one other distinct name should appear in the “mountains classification” column besides Mickaël Delage.

Evidence collected
1) Distinct names and counts in the mountains classification column
SQL executed:
SELECT "mountains classification", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
GROUP BY "mountains classification";

Result:
- not awarded — 1 time
- mickaël delage — 1 time
- serafín martínez — 6 times
- david moncoutié — 13 times

Interpretation: Excluding “not awarded,” there are two other distinct names (serafín martínez and david moncoutié) besides mickaël delage in the mountains classification column.

2) Stage-by-stage mountains classification holders
SQL executed:
SELECT stage, "mountains classification" FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a ORDER BY stage;

Result (abridged for clarity):
- Stage 1: not awarded
- Stage 2: mickaël delage
- Stages 3–8: serafín martínez
- Stages 9–21: david moncoutié

Conclusion
- The data shows two other mountains classification holders besides Mickaël Delage (Serafín Martínez and David Moncoutié). Therefore, the claim that there is “only 1 other winner” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “winner in the mountain classification” as the jersey holder (leader) of the mountains classification after each stage within the 2010 Vuelta a España, as that is what the available dataset represents.
