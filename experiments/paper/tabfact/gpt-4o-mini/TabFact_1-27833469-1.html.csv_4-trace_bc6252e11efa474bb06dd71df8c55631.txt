Data sources discovered: A PostgreSQL database with a single table public.will_grace_season_5 (Season 5 of Will & Grace). Columns: series (bigint), season (text), title (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (double precision).

Goal interpreted: Verify whether the episode titled "All About Christmas Eve" is episode number 12 (within the season) and, if not, identify its correct episode number and what episode 12’s title is.

Evidence collected
1) Enumerate all episodes with their overall series numbers and titles
SQL executed:
SELECT series, title FROM will_grace_season_5 ORDER BY series ASC;
Result (excerpt around the relevant entries):
- 100 | marry me a little , marry me a little more
- 101 | the honeymoon 's over
- 102 | all about christmas eve
- 103 | field of queens
- 104 | fagmalion part i : gay it forward

2) Compute season-relative episode order (since this table is Season 5 only) and align titles
SQL executed:
SELECT series, title, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY series ASC) AS season_episode_no
FROM will_grace_season_5
ORDER BY series;
Key results:
- Season Episode No 10 | Series 102 | all about christmas eve
- Season Episode No 11 | Series 103 | field of queens
- Season Episode No 12 | Series 104 | fagmalion part i : gay it forward

Findings
- “All About Christmas Eve” appears in Season 5 as the 10th episode (season_episode_no = 10), corresponding to overall series number 102.
- Episode number 12 of Season 5 is titled “Fagmalion Part I: Gay It Forward,” not “All About Christmas Eve.”

Conclusion
Based on the Season 5 dataset for Will & Grace, the statement that “All About Christmas Eve” is the title of episode number 12 is contradicted by the data. It is episode 10 in this season; episode 12 has a different title.

Assumptions made
- The user’s claim refers to Will & Grace Season 5, as that is the only available authoritative dataset. If a different show or season was intended, that context is not present in the accessible data sources.
