Claim interpreted: There are 3 translators with frequencies in the 100s MHz range and 3 translators with frequencies in the 90s MHz range.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: whlp(call sign text, frequency mhz double precision, city of license text, erp w bigint, class text, fcc info text)

Evidence
1) Dataset overview
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.whlp;
- Returned rows:
  - w221by — 92.1 MHz — Elgin, Illinois — 38 W — class d
  - w264bf — 100.7 MHz — Englewood, Illinois — 2 W — class d
  - w240bj — 95.9 MHz — Crown Point, Indiana — 10 W — class d
  - w276bm — 103.1 MHz — Park Forest, Illinois — 19 W — class d
  - w293al — 106.5 MHz — Rochester, Indiana — 80 W — class d
  - w223au — 92.5 MHz — South Bend, Indiana — 10 W — class d

2) Translators in the 100s MHz (>=100 and <110)
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM public.whlp WHERE "frequency mhz" >= 100 AND "frequency mhz" < 110;
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS translator_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "frequency mhz" >= 100 AND "frequency mhz" < 110;
- Results:
  - w264bf — 100.7 MHz
  - w276bm — 103.1 MHz
  - w293al — 106.5 MHz
  - Count: 3

3) Translators in the 90s MHz (>=90 and <100)
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz" FROM whlp WHERE "frequency mhz" >= 90 AND "frequency mhz" < 100;
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM whlp WHERE "frequency mhz" >= 90 AND "frequency mhz" < 100;
- Results:
  - w221by — 92.1 MHz
  - w240bj — 95.9 MHz
  - w223au — 92.5 MHz
  - Count: 3

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 3 translators in the 100s MHz range and 3 translators in the 90s MHz range. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Translator” refers to each row in public.whlp (class d entries typical for FM translators).
- “In the 100s” means frequency >= 100.0 MHz and < 110.0 MHz; “in the 90s” means >= 90.0 MHz and < 100.0 MHz.
