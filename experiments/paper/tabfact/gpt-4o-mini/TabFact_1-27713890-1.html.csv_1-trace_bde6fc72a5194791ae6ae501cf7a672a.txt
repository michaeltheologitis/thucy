Claim to verify: “episode 11, the one with all the resolution, air on the 7th of january, 1999.”

Data sources consulted:
- public.friends_season_5 (PostgreSQL table containing Friends Season 5 episode data)

Evidence and SQL used:
1) Identify Season 5, Episode 11 title and original air date
SQL executed:
SELECT title, "original air date"
FROM friends_season_5
WHERE "no in season" = 11;
Result:
- title: The One with All the Resolutions
- original air date: January 7, 1999

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- “episode 11”: Supported (the row returned corresponds to Season 5, Episode 11).
- “the one with all the resolution”: Slightly inaccurate; the correct title is “The One with All the Resolutions” (plural “Resolutions”).
- “air on the 7th of january, 1999”: Supported. The original air date in the data is January 7, 1999.

Conclusion: The air date and episode position are correct. The episode title is misstated in the singular; the correct title uses the plural “Resolutions.”

Assumptions:
- “episode 11” refers to Friends Season 5, Episode 11, given the phrasing “The One with …” which matches Friends’ episode naming convention and the available Season 5 dataset.
