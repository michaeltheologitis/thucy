Claim to verify: "the black knight score 54 point against lehigh on september 20th raise their record to 2 - 0"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team (1975 Army Cadets/Black Knights football season results).

Relevant schema (abridged):
- date (text): game date
- opponent (text): opposing team
- "black knights points" (bigint): Army’s points
- opponents (bigint): opponent’s points
- result (text): win/loss
- record (text): team record after the game

Evidence from data:
- Target game row for Lehigh:
  - Date: September 20
  - Opponent: Lehigh
  - Black Knights Points: 54
  - Opponent Points: 32
  - Result: Win
  - Record: 2 - 0

Executed SQL queries (supporting evidence):
1) Retrieve the specific Lehigh game row:
SELECT date, opponent, "black knights points", opponents, result, record 
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team 
WHERE opponent ILIKE 'Lehigh';

2) (Context/validation) List season rows to inspect date formatting and sequence:
SELECT date, opponent, "black knights points", opponents, result, record 
FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team;

Assessment of sub-claims:
- "score 54 point" — Supported: black knights points = 54.
- "against lehigh" — Supported: opponent = Lehigh.
- "on september 20th" — Supported: date = September 20.
- "raise their record to 2 - 0" — Supported: record = 2 - 0 for that game.

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are directly supported by the dataset for the 1975 season.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the 1975 Army football season (the available authoritative dataset). The team is historically known as Army Cadets/Black Knights, and the column naming uses "black knights points," which aligns with the claim’s wording.
