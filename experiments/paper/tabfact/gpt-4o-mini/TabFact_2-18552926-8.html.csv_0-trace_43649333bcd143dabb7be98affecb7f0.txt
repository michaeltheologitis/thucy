Claim to verify: “fox mulder win best actor in a leading role in 1996.”

Step 1 – Explore available data sources
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with one table: public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files.
- Table columns (from schema inspection):
  - year (bigint)
  - category (text)
  - recipients and nominees (text)
  - role / episode (text)
  - result (text)

Step 2 – Retrieve evidence from the data
A) Check for 1996 entries with category containing “Best Actor in a Leading Role”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files 
  WHERE year = 1996 
  AND (category ILIKE '%Best Actor in a Leading Role%');
- Result (as reported by the query tool):
  - Category: Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series
  - Recipients and Nominees: David Duchovny
  - Role / Episode: Fox Mulder
  - Result: Won
  - Year: 1996

B) Confirm 1996 entries for David Duchovny
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files 
  WHERE year = 1996 AND "recipients and nominees" ILIKE '%Duchovny%';
- Result:
  - Category: Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series
  - Recipients and Nominees: David Duchovny
  - Role / Episode: Fox Mulder
  - Result: Won
  - Year: 1996

C) Check for 1996 entries mentioning “Fox Mulder” in recipient or role
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files 
  WHERE year = 1996 AND ("recipients and nominees" ILIKE '%Fox Mulder%' OR "role / episode" ILIKE '%Fox Mulder%');
- Result:
  - Category: Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series
  - Recipients and Nominees: David Duchovny
  - Role / Episode: Fox Mulder
  - Result: Won
  - Year: 1996

Assessment
- The dataset shows that in 1996, David Duchovny won an award in the category “Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series” for his role as Fox Mulder.
- Awards are conferred to the actor (David Duchovny), not to the character (Fox Mulder). Thus, phrasing the claim as “Fox Mulder win …” is inaccurate in attribution.
- The claim is also missing the qualifier “- Drama Series,” which is part of the category name in the data.

Conclusion
- Substantive element supported: In 1996, the actor who played Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) won a “Best Actor in a Leading Role - Drama Series” award.
- Substantive element inaccurate: The award did not go to the character “Fox Mulder,” and the precise category includes “- Drama Series.”

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to awards related to The X-Files and its principal actor in 1996, based solely on the available dataset. The specific award body is not identified in the table and thus not asserted here.
