Claim interpreted: The user asserts that in the 2007–2008 season, September 26, 2007 was the season finale.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact. Available table: csi_franchise (seasons, tv season labels, season premiere and finale dates, viewers, etc.).
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - Columns: season (bigint), episodes (bigint), time slot (est) (text), season premiere (text), season finale (text), tv season (text), rank (bigint), viewers (in millions) (double precision).

Evidence
1) Check if any season has a season finale on September 26, 2007
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM csi_franchise WHERE lower("season finale") LIKE '%september 26, 2007%';
- Result: No rows returned. This indicates no season in the dataset lists September 26, 2007 as its season finale.

2) Inspect the 2007–2008 tv season entry to see its premiere and finale dates
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "tv season", "season premiere", "season finale"
  FROM csi_franchise
  WHERE lower("tv season") LIKE '%2007%' OR lower("tv season") LIKE '%07–08%' OR lower("tv season") LIKE '%2007-08%';
- Result rows:
  season=3, tv season=2006 - 2007, season premiere=September 20, 2006, season finale=May 16, 2007
  season=4, tv season=2007 - 2008, season premiere=September 26, 2007, season finale=May 21, 2008
- Interpretation: For the 2007 - 2008 tv season (season 4), September 26, 2007 is the season premiere, not the finale. The finale occurred on May 21, 2008.

Assessment
- True component: There is a tv season labeled 2007 - 2008 in the data.
- False component: September 26, 2007 is not the season finale; it is the season premiere for that season. No season in the dataset has a finale on September 26, 2007.

Conclusion: The central assertion about the finale date is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the available CSI franchise season dataset (csi_franchise), as this is the only accessible authoritative data source.
- Date matching treated as literal text dates in the table (e.g., "September 26, 2007").
