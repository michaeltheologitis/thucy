Summary
- Interpreted claim: “the first record be record after november 1965.” I interpret this as asserting that the earliest ‘first’ date in the available dataset occurs after November 1965 (i.e., December 1965 or later).
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL schema public with table list_of_sumo_record_holders (columns: name, total, first, last, highest rank). The first and last fields are text values that represent month and year (e.g., “november 1965”).

What I checked
1) Inspected sample rows to understand the values in the first column and confirm month-year formatting.
2) Computed the minimum parsed date from the first column.
3) Listed the earliest rows by parsed date to verify boundaries.

Findings
- The minimum first date is November 1965, associated with Hasegawa.
- Therefore, the earliest record is not after November 1965; it is in November 1965.

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Inspect sample values
SQL:
SELECT name, first, last FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders LIMIT 50;

Observed (excerpt): includes rows such as
- hasegawa | november 1965 | september 1974
- daikirin | november 1966 | september 1970
- takamiyama | november 1969 | september 1982

2) Compute the minimum first date
SQL:
SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(first, 'Month YYYY')) AS earliest_date, name, first 
FROM list_of_sumo_record_holders 
GROUP BY name, first 
ORDER BY earliest_date LIMIT 1;

Result:
- earliest_date: 1965-11-01
- name: Hasegawa
- first: November 1965

3) List earliest rows by parsed month-year
SQL:
SELECT name, first, TO_DATE(first, 'Month YYYY') AS first_date 
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders 
ORDER BY first_date ASC 
LIMIT 10;

Result (top of list):
- hasegawa | november 1965 | 1965-11-01
- daikirin | november 1966 | 1966-11-01
- takamiyama | november 1969 | 1969-11-01
...

Conclusion
- The earliest ‘first’ date is November 1965, not strictly after it. The claim that the first record is after November 1965 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “first record” refers to the chronologically earliest value in the first column of the list_of_sumo_record_holders table.
- “after November 1965” is interpreted strictly as later than November 1965 (i.e., December 1965 or later).
- The text in first represents a month-year and is correctly parsed by TO_DATE with the format 'Month YYYY'.
