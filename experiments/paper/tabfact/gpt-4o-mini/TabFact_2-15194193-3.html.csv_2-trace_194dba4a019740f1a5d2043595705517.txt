Claim to verify: “1971 be the only year Alberto Pagani win 2 time in the same year.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.alberto_pagani (columns: year, class, team, points, wins)

Evidence
1) Full record inspection
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.alberto_pagani ORDER BY year, class;
Result (excerpt relevant to wins):
- 1969: wins = 1 (500cc, linto)
- 1971: wins = 0 (125cc, derbi); 0 (250cc, suzuki); 1 (500cc, linto); 1 (500cc, mv agusta) → total 2
- 1972: wins = 1 (500cc, mv agusta)
All other listed years have 0 wins.

2) Per-year totals of wins across all classes
SQL executed:
SELECT year, SUM(wins) AS total_wins 
FROM public.alberto_pagani 
GROUP BY year 
ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 1959: 0
- 1960: 0
- 1961: 0
- 1962: 0
- 1963: 0
- 1964: 0
- 1965: 0
- 1966: 0
- 1967: 0
- 1968: 0
- 1969: 1
- 1970: 0
- 1971: 2
- 1972: 1

3) Identify years with exactly two or more than two wins
SQL executed:
SELECT year, SUM(wins) AS total_wins 
FROM public.alberto_pagani 
GROUP BY year 
HAVING SUM(wins) >= 2 
ORDER BY year;
Result: 1971 (total_wins = 2)

SQL executed:
SELECT year, SUM(wins) AS total_wins 
FROM public.alberto_pagani 
GROUP BY year 
HAVING SUM(wins) > 2 
ORDER BY year;
Result: none

Conclusion
- According to the data, Alberto Pagani’s only year with exactly two wins in the same year is 1971. No other year has two or more wins.
- Therefore, the claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win 2 time in the same year” as the total number of Grand Prix race wins across all classes in a given calendar year equals 2. The table’s wins field per row (year, class, team) was summed per year to determine yearly totals.
- Treated the TabFact database as authoritative for Alberto Pagani’s career results.
