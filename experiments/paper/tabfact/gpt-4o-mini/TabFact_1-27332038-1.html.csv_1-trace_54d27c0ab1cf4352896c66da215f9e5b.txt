Claim to verify: “the episode with the production code of 2arg01 be originally air on october 6 , 2010.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.modern_family_season_2.

Evidence collected
1) Full season listing (shows production codes and original air dates)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title, "production code", "original air date" FROM modern_family_season_2;
- Relevant returned row (excerpt):
  no in season: 3 | title: earthquake | production code: 2arg01 | original air date: october 6 , 2010

2) Targeted lookup by production code (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no in season", title, "original air date"
  FROM modern_family_season_2
  WHERE "production code" ILIKE '2arg01';
- Returned result:
  Title: Earthquake
  No in Season: 3
  Original Air Date: October 6, 2010

Conclusion
- The database shows that production code 2arg01 corresponds to the episode “Earthquake,” which originally aired on October 6, 2010. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to the Modern Family Season 2 dataset available in the connected database and the “original air date” field represents the episode’s first U.S. broadcast date.
