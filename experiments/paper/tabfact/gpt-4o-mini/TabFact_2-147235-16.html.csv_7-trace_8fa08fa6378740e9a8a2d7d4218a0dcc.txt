Claim to verify: “斤 and 担 / 擔 both have the same relative value.”

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
Result: One table found — public.chinese_units_of_measurement.

Step 2 — Inspect schema of the relevant table
Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'chinese_units_of_measurement';
Results show columns: character (text), jyutping (text), portuguese (text), "relative value" (text), "metric value" (text), "imperial value" (text). No constraints found (checked via information_schema.table_constraints and key_column_usage).

Step 3 — Retrieve unit entries and their relative values
Evidence (executed SQL):
SELECT character, jyutping, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement;
Key rows from the result:
- 斤 — jyutping: gan1; portuguese: cate; relative value: 1; metric value: 604.78982 g; imperial value: ~1.3333 lb
- 担 / 擔 — jyutping: daam3; portuguese: pico; relative value: 100; metric value: 60.478982 kg; imperial value: ~133.3333 lb

Assessment
- The data clearly indicates that 斤 has relative value 1, while 担 / 擔 has relative value 100. Therefore, they do not have the same relative value.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Relative value” is interpreted as the standardized scale provided in the public.chinese_units_of_measurement table, where units are expressed relative to 斤 = 1 (catty) and 担/擔 (picul) = 100.
