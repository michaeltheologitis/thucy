Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. In the 1990–91 FA Cup dataset, there are no matches after 30/01/1991 where Liverpool were the home team with a score of 2-3. In fact, Liverpool’s only home match in this dataset occurred on 26/01/1991 and finished 2-2; the 2-3 result on 30/01/1991 had Liverpool as the away team.

Evidence from executed SQL:

1) Find all 2-3 scorelines (normalize spacing and dash) to see who was home/away
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE REPLACE(REPLACE(TRIM(score), ' ', ''), '–', '-') = '2-3';
Result:
- tie no: replay; home team: brighton & hove albion; score: 2 - 3; away team: liverpool; date: 30 / 01 / 1991.
Interpretation: The 2-3 score on 30/01/1991 had Liverpool as the away team, not the home team.

2) List all rows where Liverpool were the home team (case-insensitive) to see what exists in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE LOWER("home team") = 'liverpool'
ORDER BY TO_DATE(TRIM(REPLACE(REPLACE("date", ' ', ''), '/', '-')), 'DD-MM-YYYY') ASC;
Result:
- One row: tie no: 1; date: 26 / 01 / 1991; home team: Liverpool; score: 2 - 2; away team: Brighton & Hove Albion.
Interpretation: Liverpool’s only home match in this dataset is on 26/01/1991 with a 2-2 score, before 30/01/1991.

3) Directly test for Liverpool home matches after 30/01/1991
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE lower("home team") = 'liverpool'
AND REPLACE(REPLACE("date", ' ', ''), '/', '-')::date > '1991-01-30';
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: There are no Liverpool home matches in this dataset after 30/01/1991.

4) Directly test for Liverpool home with a 2-3 final score (any date)
SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team"
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE LOWER("home team") = 'liverpool'
AND REPLACE(REPLACE("score", ' ', ''), '–', '-') = '2-3';
Result: No rows returned.
Interpretation: No evidence of Liverpool losing/winning 2-3 at home in this dataset.

Overall assessment based on the dataset:
- The only 2-3 match in this dataset involving Liverpool is on 30/01/1991, but Liverpool were the away team.
- There are no Liverpool home matches after 30/01/1991, hence the claim that a 2-3 score occurred with Liverpool as home after that date is not supported.

Assumptions:
- The user’s intent was interpreted as: “Verify whether there exists a match after 30/01/1991 in which Liverpool were the home team and the final score was 2-3,” within the available 1990–91 FA Cup dataset (public.t_1990_91_fa_cup).
