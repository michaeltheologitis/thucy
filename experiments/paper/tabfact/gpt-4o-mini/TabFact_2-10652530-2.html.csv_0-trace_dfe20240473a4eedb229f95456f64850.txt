Data source exploration:
- Available database contains a table t_2004_cleveland_browns_season with columns: week, date, opponent, result, stadium, record, attendance.

Evidence from data:
- I queried the 2004 Cleveland Browns season data for any game with attendance exactly 65,677 and retrieved the corresponding stadium.

Executed SQL (supporting evidence):
SELECT week, date, opponent, stadium, attendance 
FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season 
WHERE attendance = 65677;

Result returned by the database:
- Week: 12
- Date: November 28, 2004
- Opponent: Cincinnati Bengals
- Stadium: Paul Brown Stadium
- Attendance: 65,677

Conclusion: The data shows that a game with attendance 65,677 took place at Paul Brown Stadium (Bengals vs. Browns on Nov 28, 2004). This directly supports the claim.
