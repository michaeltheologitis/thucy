Summary conclusion:
- The episode titled "there 's somebody close behind you" from the TV series The Baron was filmed in December 1965, not in July/August 1966. Therefore, the claim that it was being filmed in Jul/Aug 1966 is contradicted by the data.

Evidence from the database:
1) Locate the episode by title (broad search)
- Result:
  • Episode Number: 14
  • Production Number: 111
  • Title: there 's somebody close behind you
  • Original Air Date: 28 December 1966
  • Filmed: December 1965
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, prod, title, originalairdate, filmed FROM the_baron WHERE title ILIKE '%There''s Someone%' OR title ILIKE '%Somebody Close Behind You%';

2) Retrieve the exact row for the episode (precise search)
- Result:
  • Episode: 14
  • Production Number: 111
  • Title: there 's somebody close behind you
  • Directed By: Roy Baker
  • Written By: Terry Nation and Dennis Spooner
  • Original Airdate: 28 December 1966
  • Filmed: Dec 1965
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM the_baron WHERE title ILIKE '%there ''s somebody close behind you%';

Interpretation:
- The database entry explicitly lists the filming period as December 1965. This rules out July/August 1966 as the filming window for this episode.

Assumptions and notes:
- Assumed the claim refers to the The Baron episode titled "there 's somebody close behind you" and that "be film" means "was being filmed."
- The available authoritative dataset for The Baron was used as the source of truth.
