Summary
I verified the claim against the available authoritative dataset (TabFact -> public.t_2008_pga_championship), which appears to contain the 2008 PGA Championship leaderboard. The data shows that Camilo Villegas (Colombia) and David Toms (United States) both finished T9 at +3 to par.

Key Evidence from Data
1) Locate the players (successful query)
SQL:
SELECT player, country, place, "to par"
FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship
WHERE player ILIKE '%Villegas%' OR player ILIKE '%Toms%';

Result excerpt:
- David Toms | United States | T9 | +3
- Camilo Villegas | Colombia | T9 | +3

2) Initial exact-match attempts (no rows returned, shown for completeness)
SQL:
SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player = 'Camilo Villegas';

SQL:
SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player LIKE 'David Tom%';

Conclusion
- Camilo Villegas: Colombia, T9, +3 — matches the claim.
- David Toms: United States, T9, +3 — matches the claim (note: the claim spells the surname as “Tom,” but data confirms “Toms”).

Therefore, the claim that Camilo Villegas (Colombia) and David Toms (United States) tied for 9th place at +3 to par is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 2008 PGA Championship, which is the available dataset. Minor misspellings in the claim ("david tom" vs. David Toms; "united state" vs. United States) are treated as typographical errors.
