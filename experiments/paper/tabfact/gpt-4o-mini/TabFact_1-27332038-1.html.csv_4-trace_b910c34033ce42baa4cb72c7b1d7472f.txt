Claim to verify: “halloween have production code 2arg09 and be number 47 in the series.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: modern_family_season_2 (episodes of Modern Family Season 2)
- Columns: no in series (bigint), no in season (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), original air date (text), production code (text), us viewers (millions) (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Initial exact-title lookup (no rows found)
SQL: SELECT title, "production code", "no in series", "no in season" FROM modern_family_season_2 WHERE title = 'Halloween';
Result: 0 rows

2) Case-insensitive partial-title lookup (found the episode)
SQL: SELECT title, "production code", "no in series", "no in season" FROM modern_family_season_2 WHERE title ILIKE '%Halloween%';
Result: title = halloween; production code = 2arg09; no in series = 30; no in season = 6

Assessment:
- Production code: The episode titled “halloween” has production code 2arg09. Supported.
- Number in the series: The same episode’s “no in series” is 30, not 47. Contradicted by data.

Conclusion: The claim is partly wrong. The production code matches (2arg09), but the series number is 30, not 47.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Modern Family Season 2 episode titled “halloween.”
- “Number in the series” is interpreted as the table’s “no in series” field.
