Claim interpreted: Sweden and Canada are the only countries in the table that did not receive a medal in one of the medal categories (gold, silver, or bronze).

Evidence from the data:
1) Nations with zero in at least one medal category
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze 
  FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics 
  WHERE gold = 0 OR silver = 0 OR bronze = 0 
  ORDER BY nation;
- Result: Canada (CAN): 0 gold, 2 silver, 3 bronze; Sweden (SWE): 4 gold, 0 silver, 2 bronze. No other nations returned.

2) Count of such nations
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS nation_count
  FROM t_1988_winter_olympics
  WHERE gold = 0 OR silver = 0 OR bronze = 0;
- Result: 2 nations.

3) Totals check for context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nation) AS total_nations FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics;
- Result: 11 nations total.

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT nation) AS nations_with_at_least_one_medal_in_each_category FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE gold > 0 AND silver > 0 AND bronze > 0;
- Result: 9 nations have at least one of each medal type. This implies 11 - 9 = 2 nations are missing at least one medal type, matching the two identified (Canada and Sweden).

Conclusion: The data shows only Canada and Sweden have zero in at least one medal category, confirming the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Do not receive a medal in 1 of the category” is interpreted as having zero medals in at least one of the medal types (gold, silver, or bronze).
- “On the table” refers to the dataset public.t_1988_winter_olympics (1988 Winter Olympics nation medal counts).
