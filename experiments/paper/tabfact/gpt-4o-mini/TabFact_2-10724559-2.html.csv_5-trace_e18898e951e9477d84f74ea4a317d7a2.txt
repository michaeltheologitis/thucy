Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret the claim as: “Among players whose current club is Chievo and who debuted after 1999, the number of goals achieved is 96.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data source: TabFact database with a single relevant table: public.football_records_in_italy (rank, all - time rank, name, debut year, current club, goals, apps).
- Schema confirms the table stores player records including debut year, current club, and goals.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify players whose current club is Chievo (case-insensitive)
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "current club", "debut year", goals, apps 
  FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
  WHERE "current club" ILIKE '%Chievo%';
- Result: One player
  - Name: Sergio Pellissier; Current Club: Chievo; Debut Year: 2002; Goals: 86; Apps: 333

2) Apply the “debut after 1999” condition and compute totals
- SQL (rows):
  SELECT * FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
  WHERE "current club" ILIKE '%Chievo%' AND "debut year" > 1999;
- Result: One player
  - Sergio Pellissier; Chievo; Debut Year: 2002; Goals: 86; Apps: 333; Rank: 8; All-Time Rank: 97
- SQL (aggregate):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count, SUM(goals) AS total_goals 
  FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
  WHERE "current club" ILIKE '%Chievo%' AND "debut year" > 1999;
- Result: player_count = 1; total_goals = 86

3) Check if any player in the table has exactly 96 goals (to test the “96 goals” figure directly)
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "current club", "debut year", goals, apps 
  FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
  WHERE goals = 96;
- Result: No rows returned

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that the only player matching “current club is Chievo” and “debut year after 1999” is Sergio Pellissier, with 86 goals. There is no record of 96 goals under these conditions, nor any player with exactly 96 goals in the table. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Debut after 1999” is interpreted as debut year >= 2000.
- “Chievo” refers to any current club string containing “Chievo” (case-insensitive), capturing entries like “Chievo” or “Chievo Verona” if present.
- “96 goal achieve” is interpreted as the total goals for the qualifying player(s) under the stated conditions.
