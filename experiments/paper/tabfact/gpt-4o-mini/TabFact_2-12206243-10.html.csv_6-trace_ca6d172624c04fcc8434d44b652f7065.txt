Claim to verify: “the blue jay fell to 76 - 86 follow their loss to the red sox on september 28.”

Summary of findings:
- The 1997 Toronto Blue Jays did play the Boston Red Sox on September 28, and the team’s record after that game was 76–86. However, the data show that the Blue Jays won that game (3–2), moving their record from 75–86 to 76–86. Therefore, the phrase “following their loss” is incorrect; it was a win, not a loss. Likewise, “fell to 76–86” is misleading—“improved to 76–86” would be accurate.

Key evidence from the database (TabFact):
1) Full September 1997 game log (excerpt includes the final Red Sox series)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season;
- Relevant returned rows (as provided by the tool):
  - september 26 | red sox | 3 - 0  | henry (7 - 3)   | 34155 | 74 - 86
  - september 27 | red sox | 12 - 5 | corsi (5 - 3)   | 37401 | 75 - 86
  - september 28 | red sox | 3 - 2  | gordon (6 - 10) | 40251 | 76 - 86
Interpretation: The record rose from 74–86 to 75–86 to 76–86 over Sept 26–28, which is consistent with three consecutive wins against the Red Sox, not losses.

2) Direct lookup for September 28 vs. Red Sox
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record 
  FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE lower(date) LIKE '%september 28%' AND lower(opponent) = 'red sox';
- Result (as provided by the tool):
  - Date: September 28
  - Opponent: Red Sox
  - Score: 3 - 2
  - Loss: Gordon (6 - 10)
  - Attendance: 40,251
  - Record: 76 - 86
Interpretation: The “Record: 76 - 86” confirms the post-game record; coupled with the previous day’s record of 75–86, this indicates a Blue Jays win on Sept 28.

3) Context from the prior day (to show the record progression)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record 
  FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE date = '1997-09-27';
- Result (as provided by the tool):
  - Date: September 27
  - Opponent: Red Sox
  - Score: 12 - 5
  - Loss: Corsi (5 - 3)
  - Attendance: 37,401
  - Record: 75 - 86
Interpretation: The day before Sept 28, the Blue Jays were 75–86. After Sept 28 they were 76–86, confirming Sept 28 was a win for Toronto.

Conclusion:
- Correct: The Blue Jays’ record was 76–86 on September 28 of the referenced season (1997).
- Incorrect: It was not “following their loss to the Red Sox.” The Blue Jays defeated the Red Sox 3–2 on September 28, raising their record to 76–86.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1997 season (the available authoritative dataset specifically covers the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays and includes a September 28 game vs. the Red Sox showing a 76–86 record after the game).
