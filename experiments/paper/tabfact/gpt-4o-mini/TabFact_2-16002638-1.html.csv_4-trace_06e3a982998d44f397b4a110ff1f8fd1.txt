Claim to verify: “the 2009 hurricane season result in the lowest final position.”

Summary conclusion: Supported by the data for the Dundee Hurricanes; 2009 is the worst (lowest) final league position recorded in the dataset.

Evidence from the database
1) 2009 season details
- Result: Season 2009 final position = 5 / 7; record 2–6–1.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2009;

2) All seasons’ final positions (raw) for context
- Result:
  2003: 4 / 11
  2004: 1 / 3
  2005: 2 / 4
  2006: 2 / 3
  2007: 1 / 6
  2008: 3 / 6
  2009: 5 / 7
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "final position" FROM public.dundee_hurricanes ORDER BY season ASC;

3) Best/worst ordinal positions across all seasons
- Result: Best position = 1 (seasons 2004, 2007). Worst position = 5 (season 2009).
- Executed SQL:
  -- extremes
  SELECT MIN(CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS best_position,
         MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS worst_position
  FROM dundee_hurricanes;

  -- seasons with best position
  SELECT season, "final position"
  FROM dundee_hurricanes
  WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) =
        (SELECT MIN(CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) FROM dundee_hurricanes);

  -- seasons with worst position
  SELECT season, "final position"
  FROM dundee_hurricanes
  WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) =
        (SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("final position" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) FROM dundee_hurricanes);

Assessment
- 2009’s final position is 5th of 7, which is the highest ordinal (worst) finishing place in the dataset. Therefore, interpreting “lowest final position” as “worst league finish,” the claim is verified.

Assumptions
- “Hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes (public.dundee_hurricanes table).
- “Lowest final position” is interpreted as the worst finishing place (i.e., largest ordinal number), not the best (smallest ordinal).
