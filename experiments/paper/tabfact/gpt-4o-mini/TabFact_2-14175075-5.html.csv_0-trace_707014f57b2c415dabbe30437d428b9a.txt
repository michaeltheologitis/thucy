Claim interpreted: "Cedar Rapids is the site with the earliest date" in the available Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series dataset.

Data source explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date [text], site [text], sport [text], winning team [text], series [text]).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Earliest row by chronological date
- Result: Date = September 4, 2007; Site = Cedar Rapids
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, site FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series ORDER BY date::date ASC LIMIT 1;

2) Cross-check using per-site minima and overall minimum
- Finding: The earliest chronological date in the dataset is 2007-09-04, and the site associated with that earliest date is Cedar Rapids.
- Executed SQL (per-site minima):
  SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')) AS earliest_date, site 
  FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
  WHERE date IS NOT NULL 
  GROUP BY site;
- Executed SQL (overall earliest date):
  SELECT MIN(earliest_date) AS overall_earliest_date 
  FROM ( 
      SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')) AS earliest_date, site 
      FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
      WHERE date IS NOT NULL 
      GROUP BY site 
  ) AS subquery;
- Executed SQL (site(s) with overall earliest date):
  SELECT site 
  FROM ( 
      SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')) AS earliest_date, site 
      FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
      WHERE date IS NOT NULL 
      GROUP BY site 
  ) AS subquery 
  WHERE earliest_date = '2007-09-04';

Conclusion:
- The earliest date in the dataset is September 4, 2007, and the associated site is Cedar Rapids. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "cedar rapid" refers to the city/site "Cedar Rapids".
- "earliest date" refers to the earliest chronological event date recorded in the iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series table.
