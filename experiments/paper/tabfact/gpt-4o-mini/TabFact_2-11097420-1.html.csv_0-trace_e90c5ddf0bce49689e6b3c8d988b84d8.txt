Claim assessed: "only 3 of the project have be complete so far"

Data source discovery
- Available database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Table: list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi

Schema snapshot (relevant columns)
- name (text)
- construction completed (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of records (context) and initial populated check
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_superfund_sites FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi;
- Result: 9

- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_construction_completed FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi WHERE "construction completed" IS NOT NULL AND TRIM("construction completed") <> '';
- Result: 9
Note: The above treats '-' as populated text. We therefore refine to count actual completion dates.

2) List sites and their "construction completed" values
- SQL:
  SELECT name, "construction completed" 
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi 
  ORDER BY name;
- Result (abridged):
  american creosote works , inc | -
  chemfax , inc | -
  davis timber company | -
  flowood site | 09 / 17 / 1993
  newsom brothers / old reichhold chemicals , inc | 08 / 08 / 1997
  picayune wood treating | -
  potter co | -
  sonford products | -
  walcotte chemical co warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982

3) Count rows with actual completion dates (exclude '-') and list them
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_completed_dates
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  WHERE "construction completed" <> '-' AND "construction completed" ~ '\d';
- Result: 3

- SQL (list):
  SELECT name, "construction completed"
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  WHERE "construction completed" <> '-' AND "construction completed" ~ '\d';
- Result:
  Flowood Site | 09 / 17 / 1993
  Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc | 08 / 08 / 1997
  Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982

4) Frequency of distinct values in "construction completed"
- SQL:
  SELECT "construction completed", COUNT(*) AS frequency
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  GROUP BY "construction completed";
- Result:
  '-' | 6
  '08 / 08 / 1997' | 1
  '12 / 30 / 1982' | 1
  '09 / 17 / 1993' | 1

Conclusion
- Interpreting “project completed” as sites with an actual date in the "construction completed" field, there are exactly 3 completed projects in the dataset. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Project” refers to Superfund site remediation projects listed in the table list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi.
- “Complete” means the "construction completed" field contains a real completion date; '-' indicates not completed.
- “So far” refers to the current state of the provided dataset.
