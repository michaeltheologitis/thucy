Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted as: “AS Porto-Novo got 3 points (i.e., a win) against Victoria Club Mokanda” or possibly “AS Porto-Novo scored 3 goals against Victoria Club Mokanda.”
- Data source available: a table of ties from the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
- Finding: In the only relevant record, AS Porto-Novo lost to Victoria Club Mokanda 0–3 on aggregate (0–1, 0–2), so AS Porto-Novo neither earned a win nor scored 3 goals.

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: PostgreSQL database with table t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (public schema).

Schema used
- Table: t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), agg (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Evidence query and results
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Porto%' OR "team 1" ILIKE '%Mokanda%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Porto%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Mokanda%';

- Result returned:
  - team 1: as porto novo
  - team 2: victoria club mokanda
  - agg: 0 - 3
  - 1st leg: 0 - 1
  - 2nd leg: 0 - 2

Analysis
- The aggregate score 0–3 indicates Victoria Club Mokanda won both legs and the tie overall.
- AS Porto-Novo did not win (so did not earn “3 points”) and did not score 3 goals; instead, they conceded 3 on aggregate.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available authoritative data for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.

Assumptions
- “Score 3 point” is interpreted as either: (a) earning 3 points by winning a match, or (b) scoring three goals. The dataset reflects a knockout tie context where points are not tallied, but the outcome clearly shows AS Porto-Novo lost both legs and did not score three goals.
