Claim assessed: “the home town of cody zeller be wichita , ks.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table: public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team (columns: player TEXT, height TEXT, school TEXT, hometown TEXT, college TEXT).

Key evidence
1) Cody Zeller entry and recorded hometown
- Result: Player: Cody Zeller | Hometown: Washington, IN | School: Washington High School | College: Indiana
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, hometown, school, college 
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team 
WHERE player ILIKE 'Cody Zeller%';

2) Check for any Cody Zeller with a Wichita hometown
- Result: No rows returned
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, hometown FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Cody Zeller%' AND hometown ILIKE '%Wichita%';

3) Cross-check for any Zeller entries (context)
- Result included Cody Zeller with hometown Washington, IN (confirms #1)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, school, hometown, college 
FROM public.usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team 
WHERE player ILIKE '%Zeller%';

Conclusion
- The database records Cody Zeller’s hometown as Washington, IN, not Wichita, KS. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Home town” refers to the “hometown” field in the USA Today All-USA High School Basketball Team dataset.
- “Cody Zeller” refers to the basketball player listed in this dataset.
