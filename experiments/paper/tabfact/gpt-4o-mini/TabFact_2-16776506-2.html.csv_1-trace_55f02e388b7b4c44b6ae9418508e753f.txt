Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that on 2 May 1999, the recorded playing surface was Hard.

Data source discovery
- We first enumerated available schemas and tables to ground the verification in the actual database contents.
  SQL executed:
  1) List schemas
  SELECT schema_name FROM information_schema.schemata;
  2) List base tables
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';

  Result (excerpt):
  - Schemas include: public
  - Tables include: leanne_baker (among system tables)

Table structure confirmation
- We inspected the structure of public.leanne_baker to understand available columns.
  SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length, numeric_precision, numeric_scale
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_schema = 'public'
  AND table_name = 'leanne_baker';

  Result (columns): outcome (text), date (text), location (text), surface (text), opponent in final (text), score (text)

Direct verification of the date and surface
- We queried the specific date to see the recorded surface.
  SQL executed:
  SELECT date, location, surface, outcome, "opponent in final", score
  FROM public.leanne_baker
  WHERE date ILIKE '2 May 1999';

  Result:
  - Date: 2 may 1999
  - Location: Coatzacoalcos, Mexico
  - Surface: Hard
  - Outcome: Winner
  - Opponent in Final: Candice Jairala
  - Score: 3 - 6, 6 - 3, 7 - 5

Conclusion
- The record for 2 May 1999 in the authoritative dataset shows Surface = Hard. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The terse claim is interpreted as referring to the surface field recorded in the public.leanne_baker dataset for the event on 2 May 1999.
- No broader context (e.g., other sports or events on that date) is implied beyond the data available in this database.
