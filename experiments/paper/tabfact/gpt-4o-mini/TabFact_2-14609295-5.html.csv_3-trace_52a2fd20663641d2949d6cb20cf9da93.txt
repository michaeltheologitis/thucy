Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (VCU Rams men’s basketball data).

Schema summary (relevant columns)
- year (bigint)
- seed (bigint)
- region (text)
- results (text)

Evidence
1) Identify the 1980 entry and its seed/region/results
SQL:
SELECT year, seed, region, results FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year BETWEEN 1979 AND 1981;
Result excerpt:
- Year: 1980; Seed: 12; Region: East; Results: Loss 72 - 86

2) Confirm that 1980 is before 1996
SQL:
SELECT year, (year < 1996) AS is_before_1996 FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1980;
Result excerpt:
- year = 1980; is_before_1996 = true

Assessment of the claim
- “in 1980”: Supported (row exists for 1980).
- “the east region”: Supported (Region = East).
- “result be a loss of 72 - 86”: Supported (Results = Loss 72 - 86).
- “from a seed 12”: Supported (Seed = 12).
- “plus the year be smaller than 1996”: Supported (1980 < 1996 is true).

Conclusion: All elements of the claim are directly supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “from a seed 12” as the team’s NCAA tournament seed being 12.
- Interpreted “result be a loss of 72 - 86” as the final game outcome in the results field being a loss by that score.
