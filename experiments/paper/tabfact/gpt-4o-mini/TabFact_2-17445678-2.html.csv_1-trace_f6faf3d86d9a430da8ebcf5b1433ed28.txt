Claim to verify: “Brian Dunn was the opponent of the match in South Dakota, United States, which had 3 rounds.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public, table: brad_gumm
- Table columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), location (text)

What the data shows
- There is a fight record with opponent Brian Dunn, located in South Dakota, United States.
- The fight’s round value is 2 (indicating the bout ended in Round 2 in this dataset’s convention), not 3.

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Direct check for the full claim (opponent = Brian Dunn, exact location string, and round = 3)
SQL executed:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location 
FROM public.brad_gumm 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) = LOWER('Brian Dunn') 
AND location = 'South Dakota, United States' 
AND round = 3;
Result: No rows returned (no match with round = 3).

2) Broader lookup for any opponent containing “Dunn” to confirm presence and context
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, event, round, location, res, method, record 
FROM public.brad_gumm 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Dunn%';
Result (1 row):
- Opponent: Brian Dunn
- Event: MSF - Total Destruction
- Round: 2
- Location: South Dakota, United States
- Result: Win
- Method: Submission (Rear Naked Choke)
- Record: 5 - 1 - 1

3) Precise match using normalized opponent name
SQL executed:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, location 
FROM public.brad_gumm 
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(opponent)) = 'brian dunn';
Result (1 row):
- res: win
- record: 5 - 1 - 1
- opponent: brian dunn
- method: submission (rear naked choke)
- event: msf - total destruction
- round: 2
- location: south dakota, united states

Assessment of each claim component
- Opponent = Brian Dunn: Supported (see queries 2 and 3).
- Location = South Dakota, United States: Supported (see queries 2 and 3).
- Had 3 rounds: Not supported. The recorded fight ended in Round 2; a search for round = 3 returned no result (query 1).

Conclusion
- The opponent and location are correct, but the statement that the match had 3 rounds is contradicted by the data (the fight ended in Round 2).

Assumptions
- “Match” refers to a fight appearing in the brad_gumm table (i.e., a Brad Gumm bout).
- The column “round” indicates the round in which the bout ended, which is the standard convention in such records.
- Location string comparisons may vary by formatting; case-insensitive and substring checks were used to avoid false negatives.
