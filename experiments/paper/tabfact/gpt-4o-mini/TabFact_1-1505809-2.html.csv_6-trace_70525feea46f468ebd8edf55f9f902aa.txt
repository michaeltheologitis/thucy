Claim interpreted: “alberta be the locale when l be 9” — i.e., in the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier dataset, whenever l (losses) equals 9, the locale is Alberta (or equivalently, there exists a row with l = 9 whose locale is Alberta).

Step 1: Check what loss values exist
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT l FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier ORDER BY l ASC;
- Result: 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8
- Finding: There is no row with l = 9 in this table.

Step 2: Explicitly search for rows where l = 9
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT locale, skip FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE l = 9;
- Result: No rows returned
- Finding: Confirms there are no entries with l = 9 at all.

Step 3: See what locales exist (to confirm Alberta is a valid locale value)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT locale FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier ORDER BY locale ASC;
- Result (alphabetical): alberta; british columbia; manitoba; new brunswick; newfoundland and labrador; northern ontario; nova scotia; ontario; prince edward island; quebec; saskatchewan
- Finding: “alberta” is indeed a locale in the dataset, but this does not change the absence of any l = 9 rows.

Step 4: Check Alberta’s actual record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT skip, w, l, pf, pa, "ends won", "ends lost", "blank ends", "stolen ends", "shot pct" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE locale = 'alberta';
- Result: skip = randy ferbey; w = 9; l = 2; pf = 90; pa = 58; ends won = 48; ends lost = 43; blank ends = 7; stolen ends = 9; shot pct = 86%
- Finding: Alberta’s losses (l) are 2, not 9.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains no entries with l = 9. Therefore, the statement that “Alberta be the locale when l be 9” is not supported. In fact, Alberta’s row shows l = 2.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the phrase as a verification task against the available 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table, where “locale” corresponds to the province/team and “l” corresponds to losses. If a different dataset or meaning (e.g., a personal age or another domain) was intended, it is not represented in the accessible data sources.
