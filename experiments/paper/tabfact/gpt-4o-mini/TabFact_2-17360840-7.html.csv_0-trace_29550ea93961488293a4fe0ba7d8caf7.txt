Claim: “the game against opponent buffalo sabre have an attendance of 10750.”

Findings grounded in data:
- Data source discovered: public.t_2008_09_tampa_bay_lightning_season (Tampa Bay Lightning 2008–09 season game log). Relevant columns include opponent (text) and attendance (bigint).

1) Games vs Buffalo Sabres
- Result: One game found vs Buffalo Sabres with attendance 15,611 (not 10,750).
- Returned row: Game 47 | Date: January 21 | Opponent: Buffalo Sabres | Location: St Pete Times Forum | Score: 5 - 3 | Attendance: 15,611
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, opponent, location, score, attendance 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_tampa_bay_lightning_season 
  WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%buffalo%';

(Alternate check used by the tool produced the same matchup and attendance)
  SELECT game, date, location, score, attendance 
  FROM t_2008_09_tampa_bay_lightning_season 
  WHERE LOWER(opponent) = LOWER('Buffalo Sabres') 
  ORDER BY date;

2) Any game with attendance = 10,750
- Result: A different game matched that attendance: vs Atlanta Thrashers (not Buffalo Sabres).
- Returned row: Game 39 | Date: January 4 | Opponent: Atlanta Thrashers | Location: Philips Arena | Score: 4 - 1 | Attendance: 10,750
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, opponent, location, score, attendance 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_tampa_bay_lightning_season 
  WHERE attendance = 10750;

Conclusion: The only game against the Buffalo Sabres in this dataset had an attendance of 15,611. The attendance figure 10,750 pertains to a different opponent (Atlanta Thrashers). The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “buffalo sabre” was interpreted as the NHL team “Buffalo Sabres.”
- Verification was performed against the available authoritative dataset for the Tampa Bay Lightning’s 2008–09 season, treating it as complete within its scope.
- Case-insensitive matching was used to avoid issues with capitalization or minor naming variations.
