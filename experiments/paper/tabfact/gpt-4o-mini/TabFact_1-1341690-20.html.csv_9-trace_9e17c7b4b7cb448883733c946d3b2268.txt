Findings
- In the 1974 US House elections, the incumbent for Maryland’s 1st congressional district was Robert Bauman (Republican), who was re-elected.
- Thomas J. Hatem appears as the Democratic candidate with 47.0% of the vote, not the incumbent.

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative 1974 election data available, Thomas J. Hatem was not the incumbent candidate for Maryland’s 1st congressional district; he was the challenger. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Maryland district 1” is interpreted as Maryland’s 1st congressional district for the U.S. House of Representatives.
- “Incumbent candidate” is interpreted as the sitting officeholder seeking re-election.
- The available data source covers the 1974 election cycle; conclusions are grounded in that year’s dataset.
