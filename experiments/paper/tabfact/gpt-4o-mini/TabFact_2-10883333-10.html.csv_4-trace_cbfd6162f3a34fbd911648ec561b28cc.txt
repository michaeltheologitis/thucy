Claim to verify: “Kardinia Park have less crowd than Moorabbin Oval.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Table: public.t_1975_vfl_season
  - Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence from the data
1) List all rows (to see venue-level crowds)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT venue, crowd, "home team", "away team", date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
- Relevant results:
  - Venue: Kardinia Park | Crowd: 13328 | Home Team: Geelong | Away Team: Melbourne | Date: 7 June 1975
  - Venue: Moorabbin Oval | Crowd: 17811 | Home Team: St Kilda | Away Team: North Melbourne | Date: 7 June 1975
  - (Other venues also listed but not relevant to this comparison.)

2) Aggregate confirmation: total crowds by venue (including the two venues in question)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT venue, SUM(crowd) AS crowd
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  GROUP BY venue
  ORDER BY venue;
- Relevant aggregated results:
  - Kardinia Park: 13328
  - Moorabbin Oval: 17811
  - Difference (Moorabbin – Kardinia): 4483

3) Direct totals per venue (as separate queries)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd_kardinia FROM t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Kardinia Park%';
  Result: 13328
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd_moorabbin FROM t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue ILIKE '%Moorabbin Oval%';
  Result: 17811

Analysis
- In the available 1975 VFL match data, Kardinia Park’s recorded crowd (13,328) is lower than Moorabbin Oval’s (17,811). The difference is 4,483 spectators. Therefore, within this dataset, the claim is supported.

Conclusion
- The data shows Kardinia Park had fewer spectators than Moorabbin Oval for the recorded matches in this table.

Assumptions made
- “Crowd” is interpreted as the recorded spectator attendance in the table.
- The comparison is made strictly using the available data (1975 VFL entries in public.t_1975_vfl_season), which contains one game per venue on 7 June 1975. No broader historical inference beyond these records is implied.
