Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Daisuke Hanazawa was the opponent at the event “GCM - DOG 4” in Chiba, Japan.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact
- Available schema/table: public.katsuya_inoue — fight/event records for Katsuya Inoue with columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location.

Schema details (as reported by the schema tool)
- Table: public.katsuya_inoue
  - Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text), location (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Exact-match check for the full claim (opponent, event, and location)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent = 'Daisuke Hanazawa' AND event = 'GCM - DOG 4' AND location = 'Chiba, Japan';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Check for the event “DOG 4” regardless of case, to find actual opponent and location
SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, location, res, record, method, round, time FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE '%dog 4%';
Result:
- Opponent: Daisuke Hanazawa; Event: GCM - DOG 4; Location: Tokyo, Japan; Result: Win; Record: 11 - 3; Method: Decision (Majority); Round: 3; Time: 5:00

3) Verify occurrences of the opponent name
SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Hanazawa%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Daisuke%';
Results include:
- Daisuke Hanazawa — Event: Pancrase - Shining 10 — Location: Tokyo, Japan
- Daisuke Hanazawa — Event: GCM - Dog 4 — Location: Tokyo, Japan

4) Check all rows with location containing “Chiba”
SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE LOWER(location) LIKE '%chiba%';
Results:
- Opponent: Kim Haeng Ki — Event: Mars World Grand Prix — Location: Chiba, Japan
- Opponent: Satoru Kitaoka — Event: Pancrase - Brave 10 — Location: Chiba, Japan
(Note: No Daisuke Hanazawa entries in Chiba.)

5) Survey all “GCM” events to confirm consistency
SQL:
SELECT opponent, event, location FROM katsuya_inoue WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE '%gcm%';
Results include:
- Daisuke Hanazawa — gcm - dog 4 — tokyo , japan
- Other GCM events list locations as Tokyo, Saitama, or Japan, not Chiba

Assessment
- True component: Daisuke Hanazawa was indeed the opponent at the event “GCM - DOG 4”.
- False component: The event location in the data is Tokyo, Japan—not Chiba, Japan. No record shows Daisuke Hanazawa’s bout in Chiba.

Conclusion
The claim mixes a correct identification of the opponent/event with an incorrect location.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (public.katsuya_inoue), i.e., events involving Katsuya Inoue. The claim was evaluated against this authoritative table.
