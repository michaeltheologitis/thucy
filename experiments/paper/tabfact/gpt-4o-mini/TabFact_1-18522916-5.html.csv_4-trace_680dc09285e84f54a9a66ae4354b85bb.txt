Claim to verify: “daniel uberti leave fa on 29 december 2008.”

Findings grounded in data:
- Evidence that Daniel Uberti left his post on 29 December 2008
  • Result: The table shows Daniel Uberti as the outgoing manager of Nejapa with a vacancy date of 29 December 2008 (manner of departure: Sacked; replaced by Nelson Ancheta).
  • Executed SQL:
    SELECT team, "outgoing manager", "date of vacancy" 
    FROM primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 
    WHERE "outgoing manager" ILIKE '%Uberti%';
  • Returned row (summary): Team = Nejapa; Outgoing Manager = Daniel Uberti; Date of Vacancy = 29 December 2008.
  • Executed SQL (full-row confirmation):
    SELECT * FROM primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE LOWER(team) LIKE '%nejapa%';
  • Returned rows (summary):
    - Team: Nejapa; Outgoing Manager: Mauricio Cienfuegos; Manner: Mutual consent; Date of Vacancy: 14 August 2008; Replaced By: Daniel Uberti; Date of Appointment: 5 September 2008; Position: 10th.
    - Team: Nejapa; Outgoing Manager: Daniel Uberti; Manner: Sacked; Date of Vacancy: 29 December 2008; Replaced By: Nelson Ancheta; Date of Appointment: 29 December 2008; Position: Post-season (10th).

- Evidence regarding “FA” (interpreted as C.D. FAS)
  • Result: For team FAS, the outgoing manager listed is Nelson Ancheta with a vacancy date of 27 December 2008, not Daniel Uberti and not on 29 December 2008.
  • Executed SQL:
    SELECT * FROM primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE LOWER(team) = LOWER('FAS');
  • Returned row (summary): Team = fas; Outgoing Manager = nelson ancheta; Manner = sacked; Date of Vacancy = 27 December 2008; Replaced By = roberto gamarra; Date of Appointment = 1 January 2009; Position = post - season (semifinals).

Conclusion:
- True: Daniel Uberti left a managerial position on 29 December 2008.
- False/Unsupported: He did not leave FAS (“FA”) on that date according to the available data; he left Nejapa. For FAS, a different manager (Nelson Ancheta) left on 27 December 2008.

Assumptions:
- “fa” was interpreted as C.D. FAS, a prominent Salvadoran club, given the dataset covers the Primera División de Fútbol Profesional Apertura 2008 (El Salvador). If “fa” was intended to mean a different entity, it is not represented in the available authoritative dataset.
