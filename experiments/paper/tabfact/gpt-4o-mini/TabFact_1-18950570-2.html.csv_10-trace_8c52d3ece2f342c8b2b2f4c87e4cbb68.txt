Summary of approach
- I first explored the available data source to identify where TFR (total fertility rate), IMR (infant mortality rate), and period values are stored. The relevant table is public.my_info_table with columns including period (text), tfr (double precision), and imr (bigint).

Evidence collected from the database
1) Rows where imr = 43
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, imr, tfr FROM public.my_info_table WHERE imr = 43;
- Result:
  period: 1990 - 1995; imr: 43; tfr: 2.6

2) Rows where tfr = 2.45
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, imr, tfr FROM public.my_info_table WHERE tfr = 2.45;
- Result:
  period: 1995 - 2000; imr: 34; tfr: 2.45

3) Check if any row has both imr = 43 and tfr = 2.45 simultaneously
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE imr = 43 AND tfr = 2.45);
- Result: false (no such row exists)

Assessment
- In the period where IMR equals 43 (1990 - 1995), the TFR is 2.6, not 2.45.
- There is a period with TFR 2.45 (1995 - 2000), but in that period the IMR is 34, not 43.
- Therefore, the claim that “there be a tfr of 2.45 in the period where the imr be 43” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the claim as referring to exact equality (IMR = 43 and TFR = 2.45) within the records of public.my_info_table.
- No rounding tolerances were applied; values are compared as stored.
