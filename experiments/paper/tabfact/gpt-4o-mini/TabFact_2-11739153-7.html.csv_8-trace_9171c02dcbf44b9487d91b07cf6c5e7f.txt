Claim to verify: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, Minnesota played at home more times than they played away.

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single relevant table: t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season.

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Executed: Describe t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
- Result summary: Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). The home and visitor columns indicate venue for each game.

Evidence from the data
1) Listing the rows (shows Minnesota’s home/away status per game)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, decision, attendance, record
  FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
  LIMIT 20;
- Returned rows (14 total in table; excerpt below includes all rows):
  February 2 | Minnesota @ Columbus (away)
  February 5 | Detroit @ Minnesota (home)
  February 7 | Dallas @ Minnesota (home)
  February 9 | NY Islanders @ Minnesota (home)
  February 10 | Minnesota @ St Louis (away)
  February 12 | Minnesota @ Edmonton (away)
  February 14 | Minnesota @ Vancouver (away)
  February 17 | Nashville @ Minnesota (home)
  February 19 | Vancouver @ Minnesota (home)
  February 20 | Minnesota @ Chicago (away)
  February 24 | Calgary @ Minnesota (home)
  February 26 | Minnesota @ Washington (away)
  February 27 | Minnesota @ Tampa Bay (away)
  February 29 | Minnesota @ Florida (away)

2) Counting games by home and away status via aggregation
- SQL executed (home counts by team):
  SELECT home, COUNT(*) AS games_at_home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season GROUP BY home ORDER BY games_at_home DESC;
- Result excerpt (relevant line):
  Minnesota | 6

- SQL executed (visitor counts by team):
  SELECT visitor, COUNT(*) AS games_as_visitor FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season GROUP BY visitor ORDER BY games_as_visitor DESC;
- Result excerpt (relevant line):
  Minnesota | 8

Findings
- In the available dataset for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season (14 games present), Minnesota is listed as the home team 6 times and as the visiting team 8 times.
- Therefore, within this dataset, Minnesota did not play more home games than away games; they played more away games (8) than home games (6).

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data; it is contradicted by the counts (home 6 vs away 8) in the t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season table.

Assumptions and notes
- The database table labeled t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season contains 14 games; it appears to be a partial subset (likely a February segment) rather than the full 82-game season. I based the verification strictly on the accessible data in this environment. If the intent was to evaluate the complete NHL regular season, additional data beyond this table would be required. Nevertheless, the available data segment contradicts the claim.
