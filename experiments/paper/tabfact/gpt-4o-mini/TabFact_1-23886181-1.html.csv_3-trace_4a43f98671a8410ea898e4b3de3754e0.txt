Claim: “AC Sparta Prague and team Netherlands are both located on the European continent.”

Data source consulted:
- PostgreSQL database containing table: list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, football club, continent, associated football club, seasons, racing drivers)

Evidence 1 — AC Sparta Prague (AC Sparta Praha):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE LOWER("football club") LIKE '%sparta%'
- Result (summarized): The row for AC Sparta (Prague/Praha) shows continent = Europe.

Evidence 2 — team netherlands:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs 
  WHERE LOWER("football club") LIKE '%netherlands%' 
     OR LOWER("football club") LIKE '%holland%' 
     OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%netherlands%' 
     OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%holland%' 
     OR LOWER("football club") LIKE '%ajax%' 
     OR LOWER("football club") LIKE '%psv%' 
     OR LOWER("football club") LIKE '%feyenoord%' 
     OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%ajax%' 
     OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%psv%' 
     OR LOWER("associated football club") LIKE '%feyenoord%';
- Result (returned by query): football club = "team netherlands"; continent = Europe.

Conclusion: Both AC Sparta Prague and team Netherlands are listed with continent = Europe in the available data. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- “AC Sparta Prague” corresponds to the club entry found via the case-insensitive search for “sparta,” which is commonly recorded as “AC Sparta Praha.”
- “team netherlands” refers to the entry returned exactly as "team netherlands" in the table.
