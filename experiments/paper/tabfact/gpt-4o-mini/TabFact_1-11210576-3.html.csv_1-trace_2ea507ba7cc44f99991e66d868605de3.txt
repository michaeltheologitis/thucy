Claim interpreted: “The final episode for the DEA agent is titled ‘Vengeance.’”

Data sources explored
- Connected database: TabFact
- Available table: public.list_of_csi_miami_characters (columns: character, position, actor, first episode, final episode, duration, final episode count)

Evidence from data
1) Identify any DEA agent and check their final episode
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position, "final episode", "final episode count"
FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters
WHERE position ILIKE '%DEA agent%';
- Result:
  - Character: Bob Keaton
  - Position: DEA Agent
  - Final Episode: Vengeance
  - Final Episode Count: 3

2) Cross-check entries with any position containing 'DEA'
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, position
FROM public.list_of_csi_miami_characters
WHERE position ILIKE '%DEA%';
- Result:
  - Character: Bob Keaton | Position: DEA Agent

Conclusion
- The table shows the DEA Agent (Bob Keaton) has final episode titled “Vengeance.” This directly supports the claim.

Notes and assumptions
- Assumption: “DEA agent” refers to the DEA agent listed in the available CSI: Miami characters dataset (Bob Keaton). No other DEA agent roles are present in the provided data.
- Minor tool inconsistency was observed on a name-specific lookup, but the position-based queries consistently returned the DEA agent row with final episode “Vengeance,” which grounds the verification above.
