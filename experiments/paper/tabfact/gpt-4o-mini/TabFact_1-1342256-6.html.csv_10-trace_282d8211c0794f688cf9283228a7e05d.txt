Data sources explored

- Table columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first elected (text), result (text), candidates (text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL)
1) Locate John H. Tolan in the 1942 dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 
WHERE LOWER(incumbent) LIKE '%tolan%' OR LOWER(candidates) LIKE '%tolan%';

Result:
- District: California 7
- Incumbent: John H Tolan
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: 1934
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: John H Tolan (D) unopposed

Assessment of the claim
- "john h tolan be the incumbent" — Supported. The row lists "Incumbent: John H Tolan" for California 7 in 1942.
- "result be new seat" — Refuted. The "Result" field is "Re-elected", not "new seat".
- "republican gain" — Refuted. The party is "Democratic", and the result is "Re-elected (unopposed)", which is not a Republican gain.

Conclusion
The dataset shows John H. Tolan was the Democratic incumbent in California’s 7th district in 1942 and was re-elected unopposed. The claim’s portions asserting "new seat" and "Republican gain" are contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1942 U.S. House elections, using the dataset’s "incumbent" and "result" fields and common result descriptors such as "new seat" and "Republican gain".
