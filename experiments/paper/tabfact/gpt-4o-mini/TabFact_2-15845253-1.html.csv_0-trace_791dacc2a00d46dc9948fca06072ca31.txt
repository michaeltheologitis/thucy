Claim to verify: “9 viral family have a replication site in the nucleus.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Relevant table: public.viral_disease
  - Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Step 1: Confirm possible values for replication site
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "replication site" FROM public.viral_disease;
Result:
- cytoplasm
- nucleus

Step 2: Count distinct families with replication site = 'nucleus'
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_families_count
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
Result: 9 distinct families

Step 3: List the distinct families with replication site = 'nucleus'
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT family
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus';
Result (families):
- Adenoviridae
- Hepadnaviridae
- Herpesviridae
- Orthomyxoviridae
- Papillomaviridae
- Parvoviridae
- Polyomaviridae
- Retroviridae
- Unassigned

Step 4: Cross-check family listings and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT family, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "replication site" = 'nucleus'
GROUP BY family;
Result (family: row_count):
- adenoviridae: 1
- hepadnaviridae: 1
- herpesviridae: 1
- orthomyxoviridae: 1
- papillomaviridae: 1
- parvoviridae: 1
- polyomaviridae: 1
- retroviridae: 1
- unassigned: 1
Aggregate distinct families from this grouping: 9

Conclusion
- The database shows exactly 9 distinct values in the family column for entries where replication site = 'nucleus'.
- These include eight named virus families and one entry labeled “unassigned.”
- Interpreting “viral family” as whatever appears in the family column, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Viral family” is taken to mean distinct values in the table’s family column, including the value “unassigned.” If one required strictly taxonomic family names only, excluding “unassigned” would yield 8.
