Claim to verify: "the new york jet play the miami dolphins before denver bronco during the 1993 season"

What I checked
- Whether, in the 1993 season, the New York Jets played the Miami Dolphins earlier in the season than they played the Denver Broncos.

Key evidence from the data
1) Games vs Miami Dolphins and Denver Broncos with weeks and dates
- Result rows (sorted by week):
  - Week: 1, Date: 1993 - 09 - 05, Opponent: denver broncos
  - Week: 2, Date: 1993 - 09 - 12, Opponent: miami dolphins
  - Week: 10, Date: 1993 - 11 - 07, Opponent: miami dolphins
- Exact SQL executed:
  SELECT week, date, opponent 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE opponent IN ('miami dolphins', 'denver broncos') 
  ORDER BY week ASC;

Interpretation: The Jets played the Denver Broncos in Week 1, and the Miami Dolphins in Weeks 2 and 10. Therefore, the Broncos game occurred before any Dolphins game.

2) Counts of games versus each opponent
- Results:
  - miami dolphins: 2 games
  - denver broncos: 1 game
- Exact SQL executed (run separately for each opponent):
  SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS game_count 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE opponent = 'miami dolphins' 
  GROUP BY opponent;

  SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS game_count 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE opponent = 'denver broncos' 
  GROUP BY opponent;

3) Full schedule context (weeks and opponents)
- Excerpt of relevant weeks:
  - Week 1: Denver Broncos
  - Week 2: Miami Dolphins
  - Week 10: Miami Dolphins
- Exact SQL executed:
  SELECT week, opponent FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season ORDER BY week ASC;

Conclusion
- The data shows the New York Jets played the Denver Broncos first (Week 1), and then the Miami Dolphins (Weeks 2 and 10). Thus, it is not true that they played the Miami Dolphins before the Denver Broncos during the 1993 season.

Assumptions
- "Before" refers to chronological order by regular-season week in 1993.
- Opponent names are matched as stored (lowercase) in the database.
- The provided table contains the complete 1993 regular-season schedule for the New York Jets.
