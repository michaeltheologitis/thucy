Claim to verify: “there be 2 republican imcubents that be first elect in 1974.”

Data source inspected: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 (US House elections, 1994). Relevant columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (bigint), status (text), opponent (text).

Evidence
1) Count of incumbents first elected in 1974 by party
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994
WHERE "first elected" = 1974
GROUP BY party;

Result:
- Democratic: 1
- Republican: 1

2) List of incumbents first elected in 1974
Executed SQL:
SELECT incumbent, district, party FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1994 WHERE "first elected" = 1974;

Result:
- John Murtha — Pennsylvania 12 — Democratic
- William F. Goodling — Pennsylvania 19 — Republican

Conclusion
The data show exactly one Republican incumbent (William F. Goodling) who was first elected in 1974, not two. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “incumbents” refers to the incumbents represented in the 1994 US House elections dataset.
- “first elect in 1974” refers to the year recorded in the "first elected" field of this dataset, which denotes the year the incumbent was first elected to the US House.
