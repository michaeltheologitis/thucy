Scope and data sources explored
- Data source discovered: a PostgreSQL database with a single table public.t_1969_vfl_season covering the 1969 VFL season.
- Table schema (as reported): columns — "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).

Key checks performed
1) Confirm that “Western Oval” exists as a venue in this dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM t_1969_vfl_season;
Result (distinct venues):
- Western Oval
- Moorabbin Oval
- Victoria Park
- Princes Park
- MCG
- Kardinia Park

Interpretation: Western Oval appears as a venue in this dataset.

2) Retrieve the match(es) played at Western Oval, and verify the home team score
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season 
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Western Oval%';

Result:
- Date: 23 August 1969
- Home Team: Footscray
- Home Team Score: 14.10 (94)
- Away Team: Essendon
- Away Team Score: 12.10 (82)
- Venue: Western Oval

Conclusion
- The only match at Western Oval in this dataset shows the home team score as 14.10 (94), not 14.13 (97). Therefore, the claim that the home team score of the match played at Western Oval is 14.13 (97) is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1969 VFL season data represented in the available table t_1969_vfl_season.
- “Home team score” refers to the "home team score" field (formatted as goals.behinds (total points)).
- Venue matching was done case-insensitively to capture any potential casing differences for “Western Oval.”
