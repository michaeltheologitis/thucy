Lowest aggregate total across the season dataset
- Compute the minimum total goals (sum of both sides of agg) and list ties at that minimum.
SQL executed (minimum total):
SELECT MIN((CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' - ', 2) AS INTEGER))) AS min_goals
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE agg ~ '^[0-9]+\s*-\s*[0-9]+$';

SQL executed (ties with the minimum total):
SELECT "team 1", agg, "team 2"
FROM public.t_1992_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE (CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) + CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, ' - ', 2) AS INTEGER)) = 2 
  AND agg ~ '^[0-9]+\s*-\s*[0-9]+$';

Results:
- Minimum total goals = 2
- Ties at that minimum:
  - team 1: tourbillon fc | agg: 1 - 1 | team 2: forces armées ca

Conclusion
- Botswana Defence Force XI’s tie has a total of 3 goals in the aggregate (1 - 2), which is higher than the minimum aggregate total (2) observed in the dataset. Thus, they do not have the lowest aggregate in the season represented by this data.

Assumptions
- “Season” refers to the competition represented by the available dataset: the 1992 African Cup of Champions Clubs.
- “Lowest agg” is interpreted as the lowest total aggregate goals across a two-legged tie (sum of both sides of the “agg” field).
