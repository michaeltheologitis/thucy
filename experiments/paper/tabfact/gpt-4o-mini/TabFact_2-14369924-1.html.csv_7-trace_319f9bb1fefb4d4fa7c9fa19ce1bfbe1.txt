Claim to verify:
- W282AE city of license is Albany, Georgia.
- W290AG city of license is Gadsden, Alabama.

Data source consulted:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: wyfk (columns: call sign, frequency mhz, city of license, erp w, class, fcc info)

Evidence gathered:
1) Table contents (sample of all rows) show the cities of license for relevant call signs:
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk LIMIT 50;
Observed rows among the results:
- W230AV | Gadsden, Alabama
- W269AX | Anniston, Alabama
- W273AE | Albany, Georgia
- W282AE | Macon, Georgia
- W290AG | Griffin, Georgia

2) Direct retrieval for the two specified call signs:
Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" ILIKE 'W282AE' OR "call sign" ILIKE 'W290AG';
Results:
- W282AE | Macon, Georgia
- W290AG | Griffin, Georgia

Assessment of the claim versus evidence:
- W282AE is listed as Macon, Georgia (not Albany, Georgia). The table shows Albany, Georgia corresponds to W273AE, not W282AE.
- W290AG is listed as Griffin, Georgia (not Gadsden, Alabama). The table shows Gadsden, Alabama corresponds to W230AV, not W290AG.

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are contradicted by the database.

Assumptions made:
- “City of license” in public.wyfk represents the authoritative city of license for each call sign.
- Call sign matching is exact as stored in the table (case-insensitive via ILIKE), and call signs are unique identifiers in this context.
