Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. Between May 25 and May 28, 1991, the Toronto Blue Jays lost three consecutive games (May 25, May 26, and May 28). There was no game on May 27 in the dataset.

Key evidence from the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season table (t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season):
- The “loss” column lists the game’s losing pitcher. When the losing pitcher is a Blue Jays pitcher (e.g., Stottlemyre, Wells, Acker), it indicates a Blue Jays loss. The record progression also corroborates wins/losses.

Primary retrieval for the dates in question:
- Results for May 25, May 26, May 27, and May 28:
  • May 25 vs Angels — Score: 5 - 0 — Loss: Stottlemyre (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 18 → Blue Jays lost.
  • May 26 vs Angels — Score: 6 - 2 — Loss: Wells (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 19 → Blue Jays lost.
  • May 27 — No row returned (no game in dataset).
  • May 28 vs Athletics — Score: 8 - 4 — Loss: Acker (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 20 → Blue Jays lost.
  ⇒ Across this window, the Blue Jays lost all three games they played; that is a 3-game losing streak spanning May 25, 26, and 28.

Context rows around the window (to show streak continuity and the off day):
- May 24 vs Angels — Score: 3 - 2 — Loss: Finley (Angels) — Record: 25 - 17 → Blue Jays won.
- May 25 vs Angels — Loss: Stottlemyre (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 18 → Loss.
- May 26 vs Angels — Loss: Wells (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 19 → Loss.
- May 27 — No game in dataset.
- May 28 vs Athletics — Loss: Acker (Blue Jays) — Record: 25 - 20 → Loss.
- May 29 vs Athletics — Loss: Slusarski (Athletics) — Record: 26 - 20 → Blue Jays won, streak ends.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) Direct retrieval for the specific dates:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date IN ('may 25', 'may 26', 'may 27', 'may 28');

2) Extended context (May 24–May 29) to show the streak and off-day:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record 
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE date IN ('may 24', 'may 25', 'may 26', 'may 27', 'may 28', 'may 29') 
ORDER BY 
    CASE date 
        WHEN 'may 24' THEN 1 
        WHEN 'may 25' THEN 2 
        WHEN 'may 26' THEN 3 
        WHEN 'may 27' THEN 4 
        WHEN 'may 28' THEN 5 
        WHEN 'may 29' THEN 6 
    END;

Discovery and schema steps (for completeness):
- Data source discovery indicated a table t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season in the public schema.
- Schema summary: columns are date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text; losing pitcher), attendance (bigint), record (text). No explicit result column; results inferred via losing pitcher and record progression.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “lose 1 consecutive game between the 25th and the 28 May 1991” as either (a) the team had exactly a one-game losing streak during that window, or (b) the team lost exactly one game within that date range. Under both interpretations, the data contradicts the claim: the team lost three consecutive games across those dates.
