Summary
- Claim: “the imperial value for both 厘 and 分 be ~0.2133 dr.”
- Finding: Supported by the imperial value field in the available data source.

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with table public.chinese_units_of_measurement containing unit names and conversion values (metric and imperial).

Schema used
- Table: public.chinese_units_of_measurement
  - Columns: jyutping (text), character (text), portuguese (text), "relative value" (text), "metric value" (text), "imperial value" (text)

Evidence query and results
Executed SQL:
SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');

Returned rows:
- 厘 | lei4 | 1 / 1600 | 37.79931 mg | ~0.2133 dr
- 分 | fan1 | 1 / 1600 | 377.9936375 mg | ~0.2133 dr

Assessment
- The imperial value column lists “~0.2133 dr” for both 厘 and 分. This directly supports the claim as stated.

Note on data anomalies
- While the claim concerns imperial values (and is supported), the metric values differ by a factor of 10 between 厘 (37.79931 mg) and 分 (377.9936375 mg), yet both have the same imperial value string. This internal inconsistency does not affect verification of the claim’s imperial-value wording but is observed in the underlying data.

Assumptions
- “dr” denotes the imperial dram (drachm) unit of mass.
- The imperial value field in the dataset is authoritative for the purpose of this verification.
