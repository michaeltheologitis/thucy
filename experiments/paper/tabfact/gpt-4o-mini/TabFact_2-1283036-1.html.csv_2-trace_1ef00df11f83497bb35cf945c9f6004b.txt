Claim interpreted: “The screening completed on 30 June 2006 started 5 months after the screening that was completed on 4 October 2006.” This implies: Start date of the 30 June 2006 screening = (4 October 2006) + 5 months.

Data sources discovered
- Source: PostgreSQL database
- Discovery query (tool): discover_data_sources
  Result: public.my_info_table (only table available)

Schema examined
- Tool: schema_query
  Summary: Table public.my_info_table with relevant text columns:
  - "screening started" (text)
  - "screening completed" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) What completed dates exist (does 4 October 2006 exist?)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "screening completed" FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY "screening completed" ASC;
- Result (excerpt relevant to 2006): includes 30 june 2006, 29 september 2006, 10 october 2006, 13 october 2006; no 4 october 2006.

2) Directly check for a row with completed = '4 october 2006'
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" = '4 october 2006';
- Result: 0 rows
- Conclusion: There is no screening completed on 4 October 2006 in the data.

3) Retrieve the screening that completed on 30 June 2006
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" = '30 june 2006';
- Result (relevant fields):
  - screening started: 18 may 2006
  - screening completed: 30 june 2006
- Conclusion: The screening completed on 30 June 2006 started on 18 May 2006.

4) Compare that start date to 4 October 2006 to test the “5 months after” assertion
- SQL (using the actual start date from the row and the claimed comparison date):
  SELECT age('2006-10-04', '2006-05-18') AS interval;
- Result: 4 months 17 days
- Interpretation: 18 May 2006 is 4 months and 17 days BEFORE 4 October 2006, not 5 months after.

Conclusion
- The database contains no screening completed on 4 October 2006, so the referenced event does not exist in the available data.
- Independently, the screening that did complete on 30 June 2006 actually started on 18 May 2006, which is 4 months and 17 days before 4 October 2006. Therefore, it is not “5 months after” the (non-existent) 4 October 2006 completion.
- Overall, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- Each row in public.my_info_table represents a single screening with its start and completion dates stored as text in the format 'DD month YYYY' (lowercase), requiring exact-case matching in equality checks.
- The phrase “be start 5 month after the screening that be complete on 4 October 2006” is interpreted as the start date of the 30 June 2006 screening occurring 5 months after 4 October 2006.
