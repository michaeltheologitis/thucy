Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact. Table: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (columns: goalkeeper text, goals bigint, matches bigint, average double precision, team text). This appears to contain goalkeeper performance data (including an average metric) for the 2008–09 Segunda División B season.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the exact team name containing “Ciudad”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(team) LIKE '%ciudad%';
- Result: Atlético Ciudad

2) Compute the highest (maximum) value of the column ‘average’ for Atlético Ciudad
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(average) AS max_average FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE 'Atlético Ciudad' AND average IS NOT NULL;
- Result: max_average = 0.61

3) List all goalkeepers for Atlético Ciudad with their average values (context)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT goalkeeper, average FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE 'Atlético Ciudad' AND goalkeeper IS NOT NULL ORDER BY average DESC;
- Result: Miguel Zapata — average 0.61

Conclusion
- The maximum (highest) ‘average’ recorded for the team Atlético Ciudad in the available dataset is 0.61. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Highest average for Atlético Ciudad” is interpreted as the maximum value in the ‘average’ column for rows where team = ‘Atlético Ciudad’ in the 2008–09 Segunda División B goalkeeper dataset.
