Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and their contents.
- Inspected the schema to identify where player-country information is stored.
- Queried the database for the player “Vijay Singh” to retrieve the associated country.
- Cross-checked how “United States” appears in this dataset for consistency of naming.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL, public schema, table: t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs (2007 FedEx Cup playoffs data).

Schema details (from the data source)
- Table: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
  - Columns: Unnamed: 0 (bigint), player (text), country (text), points (bigint), events (bigint), reset points (bigint)
  - No keys/constraints listed.

Evidence queries and results
1) Attempt to retrieve country via exact equality on player name
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE player = 'Vijay Singh';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Case-insensitive search for names containing Vijay or Singh
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE LOWER(player) LIKE '%vijay%' OR LOWER(player) LIKE '%singh%';
Result:
- Player: Vijay Singh | Country: Fiji

3) Exact case-insensitive match for “Vijay Singh”
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE player ILIKE 'Vijay Singh';
Result:
- Player: Vijay Singh | Country: Fiji

4) How “United States” appears in this dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs WHERE LOWER(country) LIKE '%united%';
Result:
- united states

Conclusion
- The table explicitly lists “Vijay Singh” with country “Fiji.”
- Therefore, the claim that “United States” is the country for Vijay Singh is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “united state” as “United States.”
- Interpreted “the player be vijay singh” as the golfer Vijay Singh referenced in this dataset.
- Assumed the ‘country’ field represents the player’s listed country/affiliation in the 2007 FedEx Cup dataset.
