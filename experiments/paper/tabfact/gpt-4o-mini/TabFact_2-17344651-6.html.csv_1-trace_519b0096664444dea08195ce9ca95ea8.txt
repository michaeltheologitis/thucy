Claim to verify: “the new york knicks do not win a game against the boston celtic in the 1984 - 85 season.”

Summary of findings based on available data:
- In the accessible 1984-85 Boston Celtics season table, there are 2 recorded games versus the New York Knicks, and in both games the Celtics scored more points than the Knicks. Within this dataset, the Knicks have 0 wins against the Celtics.
- However, the table contains only 14 total games from the 1984-85 season, which is not a full season. Therefore, the dataset does not cover all Celtics-Knicks meetings for that season, and we cannot conclude definitively for the entire season from this source alone.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List all games vs. New York Knicks
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, location, opponent, score, record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%New York%';
- Result (subset relevant to Knicks):
  • Date: January 4, 1985 | Location: Boston Garden | Opponent: New York Knicks | Score: 105 - 94 | Record: 28 - 6
  • Date: January 7, 1985 | Location: Madison Square Garden | Opponent: New York Knicks | Score: 108 - 97 | Record: 29 - 6

2) Confirm counts: total games in table and games vs Knicks
- Executed SQL (total games):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: total_games = 14
- Executed SQL (games vs Knicks):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_vs_knicks FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%' OR opponent ILIKE '%New York%';
- Result: games_vs_knicks = 2

3) Show game numbers for Knicks matchups to corroborate context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, location, opponent, score, record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%' OR opponent ILIKE '%New York%' ORDER BY game ASC;
- Result:
  • Game 34 | Date: Fri Jan 4 | Location: Boston Garden | Opponent: New York Knicks | Score: 105 - 94 | Record: 28 - 6
  • Game 35 | Date: Mon Jan 7 | Location: Madison Square Garden | Opponent: New York Knicks | Score: 108 - 97 | Record: 29 - 6

Interpretation:
- In both recorded games, the Celtics’ score exceeds the Knicks’ score (105>94 and 108>97), indicating Celtics wins and, hence, no Knicks wins in the recorded subset.
- The table’s limited coverage (14 games total) means it is not a complete season dataset; thus, while the recorded evidence supports the claim for those games, the data is insufficient to verify the claim for the entire 1984-85 season.

Conclusion:
- Within the available dataset, the Knicks did not win any recorded game against the Celtics. However, because the dataset is incomplete for the full season, the claim cannot be fully verified for the entire 1984-85 season from this source alone.

Assumptions made for interpretation:
- The table t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season represents a subset of the Boston Celtics’ 1984-85 season games (regular season; playoff inclusion unknown).
- The score field is ordered as Celtics score first, opponent score second.
- Opponent matching using ILIKE '%New York%' or '%Knicks%' correctly identifies New York Knicks games.
