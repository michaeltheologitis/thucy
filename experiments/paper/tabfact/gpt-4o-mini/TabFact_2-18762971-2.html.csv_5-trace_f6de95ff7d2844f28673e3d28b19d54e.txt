Claim to verify: “the match on March 7, 2001 [and] February 21, 2001 both have attendance over 25,000.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing: t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (Sheffield Wednesday FC 2000–2001 season). Relevant columns: date (TEXT), opponent (TEXT), venue (TEXT), result (TEXT), attendance (BIGINT).

Evidence
1) Retrieve all 2001 fixtures to inspect dates and attendance
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE date LIKE '%2001%' ORDER BY date ASC;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- 21 February 2001 | Nottingham Forest | a | 1 - 0 | 23,266
- 7 March 2001 | Portsmouth | h | 0 - 0 | 20,503

2) Targeted retrieval for the two specific dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance 
FROM public.t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season 
WHERE date ILIKE '%7 March 2001%' OR date ILIKE '%21 February 2001%';
Returned rows:
- Date: 21 February 2001 | Opponent: Nottingham Forest | Venue: Away | Result: 1 - 0 | Attendance: 23,266
- Date: 7 March 2001 | Opponent: Portsmouth | Venue: Home | Result: 0 - 0 | Attendance: 20,503

Analysis
- Both queried dates are present in the dataset.
- Attendances recorded are 23,266 (21 Feb 2001) and 20,503 (7 Mar 2001), both below 25,000.

Conclusion
- The claim that both matches had attendance over 25,000 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the match” as Sheffield Wednesday FC fixtures recorded in the table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season for the 2000–2001 season.
- Dates are matched using the text format stored in the table (e.g., “7 March 2001”, “21 February 2001”).
