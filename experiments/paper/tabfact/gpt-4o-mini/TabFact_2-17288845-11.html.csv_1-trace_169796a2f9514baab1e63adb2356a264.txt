Claim interpreted: The user asserts that in the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season, Game 4 had the series at 1–4 and occurred on April 25.

Findings from the data:
- Game 4 took place on April 25 against Dallas, and the series standing after that game was 1–3, not 1–4.
- The series reached 1–4 on April 28 (Game 5), not April 25.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Initial scan of the table
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season LIMIT 20;
Results excerpt (relevant rows shown by the tool):
- 1 | april 18 | dallas | L 97 - 105 (OT) | … | series 0 - 1
- 2 | april 20 | dallas | W 105 - 84 (OT) | … | series 1 - 1
- 3 | april 23 | dallas | L 67 - 88 (OT) | … | series 1 - 2
- 4 | april 25 | dallas | L 90 - 99 (OT) | … | series 1 - 3
- 5 | april 28 | dallas | L 93 - 106 (OT) | … | series 1 - 4

2) Verify details for Game 4
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, series FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season WHERE game = 4;
Result:
- Game: 4 | Date: April 25 | Team: Dallas | Series: 1 - 3

3) Find when the series was 1–4
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, series FROM public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season WHERE series = '1 - 4';
Result:
- Game: 5 | Date: April 28 | Team: Dallas | Series: 1 - 4

Conclusion:
- The claim that “game 4.0, series 1–4 be on April 25” is not supported. On April 25 (Game 4), the series was 1–3. The series became 1–4 on April 28 (Game 5).

Assumptions made:
- “game 4.0” refers to Game 4.
- “series 1 - 4” refers to the series standing after that game.
- The claim pertains to the 2008–09 San Antonio Spurs season (the available, authoritative dataset).
