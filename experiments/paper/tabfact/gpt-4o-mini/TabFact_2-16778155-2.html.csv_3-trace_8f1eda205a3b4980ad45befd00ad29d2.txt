Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered database: public schema with table t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season (Cincinnati Bengals 2000 season).
- Table schema (from inspection): week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check if there is a Week 10 game with attendance = 62,170
- Result: No matching row.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 10 AND attendance = 62170;

2) Retrieve the Week 10 game to see actual opponent and attendance
- Result: Week 10 was vs Baltimore Ravens, attendance 54,759.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 10;
- Returned row:
  Week: 10; Date: November 5, 2000; Opponent: Baltimore Ravens; Result: L 27 - 7; Attendance: 54,759

3) Check if any game had attendance = 62,170 and identify the opponent and week
- Result: Yes — Week 11 vs Dallas Cowboys with attendance 62,170.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE attendance = 62170;
- Returned row:
  Week: 11; Date: November 12, 2000; Opponent: Dallas Cowboys; Result: L 23 - 6; Attendance: 62,170

Conclusion
- The claim tying attendance 62,170 and opponent “at Dallas Cowboy” to Week 10 is not supported by the data. In Week 10, the Bengals played the Baltimore Ravens with attendance 54,759. The attendance 62,170 and opponent Dallas Cowboys occurred in Week 11, not Week 10.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “opponent be at dallas cowboy” to mean the opponent was the Dallas Cowboys (location/home/away status is not specified in the dataset).
- The claim is evaluated against the available dataset for the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season.
