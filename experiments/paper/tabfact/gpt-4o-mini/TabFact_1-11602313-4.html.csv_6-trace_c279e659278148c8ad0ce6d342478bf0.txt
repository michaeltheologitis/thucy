Claim to verify: “Pentium Dual-Core T3200 with release date Q2 2008 has frequency 2 GHz and sSpec number SLA4H (M0).”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors

Schema inspection
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 'list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors';
- Columns of interest: "model number" (text), "release date" (text), "frequency" (text), "sspec number" (text)

Evidence 1: Locate Pentium Dual-Core T3200 entry and read its key specs
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "model number", "release date", "frequency", "sspec number" 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
  WHERE LOWER("model number") LIKE '%t3200%' 
     OR "model number" ILIKE '%3200%';
- Result:
  - Model number: pentium dual - core t3200
  - Release date: Q4 2008
  - Frequency: 2 GHz
  - sSpec number: slavg (m0)

Evidence 2: Confirm all sSpec numbers associated with T3200
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "sspec number" 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
  WHERE "model number" LIKE '%t3200%';
- Result: slavg (m0)

Evidence 3: Check if any record uses the sSpec SLA4H
- SQL executed (exact match, case-insensitive):
  SELECT "model number", "release date", "frequency", "sspec number" 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
  WHERE LOWER("sspec number") = LOWER('SLA4H');
- Result: No rows

Evidence 4: Check for any occurrence of SLA4H as part of the sSpec field
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "model number", "sspec number" 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
  WHERE LOWER("sspec number") LIKE '%sla4h%';
- Result:
  - Model number: pentium dual - core t2390
  - sSpec number: sla4h (m0)

Evidence 5: Confirm frequency for T3200
- SQL executed:
  SELECT frequency, COUNT(*) AS frequency_count 
  FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
  WHERE "model number" LIKE '%t3200%' 
  GROUP BY frequency;
- Result: 2 GHz (1 entry)

Assessment of each sub-claim
- Frequency 2 GHz: Supported by data (2 GHz).
- Release date Q2 2008: Contradicted by data (table lists Q4 2008 for T3200).
- sSpec number SLA4H (M0): Contradicted for T3200. The table shows T3200 uses SLAVG (M0). SLA4H (M0) corresponds to the Pentium Dual-Core T2390, not T3200.
- Stepping M0: The T3200’s sSpec in the data is “slavg (m0)”, so the M0 stepping applies to T3200, but with sSpec SLAVG.

Conclusion
- The processor frequency is correct (2 GHz).
- The release date and the sSpec code in the claim do not match the authoritative data for T3200.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Intel Pentium Dual-Core mobile processor T3200.
- Matching used a case-insensitive substring search on "model number" for 't3200'.
- The public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors table is treated as authoritative for these specifications.
