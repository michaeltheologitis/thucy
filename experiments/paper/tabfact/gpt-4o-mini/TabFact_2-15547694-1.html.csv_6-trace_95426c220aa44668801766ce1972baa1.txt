Summary of verification
- Data source: public.members_of_the_5th_seanad (treated as authoritative). It lists parties and their member counts across panels, including a total per party.
- Interpretation: We verify whether the party with 21 total members has 9 more members than the party with the second-most members.

Key findings from the data
1) Parties and totals (initial overview)
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad ORDER BY total DESC;
Result (abridged):
- total: 60  [summary row]
- fianna fáil: 21
- fine gael: 9
- independent: 9
- labour party: 8
- clann na talmhan: 3

2) Top two parties by total members (excluding summary row)
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party != 'total' ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 2;
Result:
- Fianna Fáil: 21
- Fine Gael: 9

Executed SQL to compute difference:
SELECT MAX(total) AS max_total, MIN(total) AS second_max_total FROM (SELECT total FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE party != 'total' ORDER BY total DESC LIMIT 2) AS top_parties;
Result:
- max_total = 21, second_max_total = 9, difference = 12

3) Ranking to confirm ties for second-most
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, total, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY total DESC) AS rank
FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE party IS NOT NULL AND party <> 'total';
Results (relevant rows):
- Fianna Fáil: 21, rank 1
- Fine Gael: 9, rank 2
- Independent: 9, rank 2
- Labour Party: 8, rank 3

Conclusion
- The party with 21 total members is Fianna Fáil.
- The second-highest total is 9 (a tie between Fine Gael and Independent).
- The difference between 21 and the second-highest 9 is 12, not 9.

Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Party with 21 total member” refers to the party row with total = 21 in members_of_the_5th_seanad.
- The ‘total’ summary row (60) is excluded from party comparisons.
- “Second most member” refers to the second-highest total; ties are allowed at that rank.
