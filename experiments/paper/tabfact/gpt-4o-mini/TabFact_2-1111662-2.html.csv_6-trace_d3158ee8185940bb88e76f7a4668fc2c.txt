Claim assessed: "Tatyana Lebedeva be in the long jump event."

Data sources explored
- Available database: TabFact (schema: public)
- Relevant table: public.memorial_van_damme (columns: event, record, athlete, nationality, date)

Method
1) Check whether Tatyana Lebedeva appears in the dataset and, if so, for which event(s).
2) Specifically search for any entry that associates her with the Long Jump event.
3) Confirm that the Long Jump event exists in this dataset and see which athlete is listed for it.

Evidence
1) Rows for athlete = Tatyana Lebedeva
- Executed SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date
FROM public.memorial_van_damme
WHERE LOWER(athlete) = LOWER('Tatyana Lebedeva');
- Result:
  • Event: Triple Jump
  • Record: 15.14 m ( + 0.3 m / s)
  • Athlete: Tatyana Lebedeva
  • Nationality: Russia
  • Date: 5 September 2003

2) Rows where athlete contains 'Lebedeva' and event contains 'Long Jump'
- Executed SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE athlete ILIKE '%Lebedeva%' AND event ILIKE '%Long Jump%';
- Result: No rows returned

3) Verify Long Jump entries in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
SELECT event, record, athlete, nationality, date
FROM public.memorial_van_damme
WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE LOWER('%Long Jump%');
- Result:
  • Event: long jump
  • Record: 7.25 m ( + 1.7 m / s)
  • Athlete: heike drechsler
  • Nationality: germany
  • Date: 13 september 1991

Conclusion
- In this authoritative dataset, Tatyana Lebedeva appears as the athlete for a Triple Jump record and does not appear in any Long Jump entry. Therefore, the claim that she is in the Long Jump event is not supported by the evidence available here.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s claim as asserting that Tatyana Lebedeva is associated with (i.e., competed in or holds a record for) the Long Jump event as represented within the available memorial_van_damme dataset. No external data beyond this source was used.
