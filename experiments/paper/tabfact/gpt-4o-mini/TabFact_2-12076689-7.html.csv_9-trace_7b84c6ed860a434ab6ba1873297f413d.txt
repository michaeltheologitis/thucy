Scope discovery
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season (Texas Rangers 2006 season).

Schema understanding
- Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).
- Score format appears as text like “7 - 2”.

Evidence sampling to confirm score format
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 15;
Key observation: scores are stored as strings with spaces around the dash (e.g., “7 - 2”, “9 - 6”).

Verification of the claim (looking for 9 - 2 scores)
1) Exact match on the stored format
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE score = '9 - 2' ;
Result: 0 games.

2) Normalized match (remove spaces) and both orders (9-2 and 2-9)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE REPLACE(score, ' ', '') IN ('9-2', '2-9');
Result: game_count = 0.

Conclusion
Within the accessible dataset (Texas Rangers 2006 season), there are zero games with a final score of 9–2 (in either order). Therefore, the claim that “in 4 different baseball game the final score be 9 - 2” is not supported by the data available to us.

Assumptions and scope notes
- I interpreted the claim within the scope of the only accessible dataset (Texas Rangers 2006 season). If the intended scope was broader (e.g., all MLB seasons), that data is not available in the connected sources, so I cannot verify beyond this dataset.
