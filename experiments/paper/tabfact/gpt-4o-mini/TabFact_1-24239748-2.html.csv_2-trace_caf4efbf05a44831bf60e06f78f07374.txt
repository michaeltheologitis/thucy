Summary of verification
- Data source explored: TabFact database, table: list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (columns: county, exports (us mil), percent of total exports, imports (us mil), percent of total imports).

What the data shows
1) Pattern search for the claimed figures (6270.2 and 13.8%)
- Evidence result: 
  - county = vest, exports (us mil) = 6270.2, percent of total exports = 15.0 %
  - county = sud - est, exports (us mil) = 5762, percent of total exports = 13.8 %
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, "exports (us mil)", "percent of total exports"
  FROM list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  WHERE "exports (us mil)" LIKE '%6270.2%' OR "percent of total exports" LIKE '%13.8%';

2) Direct lookups for the two relevant entries
- vest:
  - exports (us mil) = 6,270.2
  - percent of total exports = 15.0%
  - imports (us mil) = 6,597.6
  - percent of total imports = 9.9%
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, "exports (us mil)", "percent of total exports", "imports (us mil)", "percent of total imports"
  FROM list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  WHERE county = 'vest';

- sud - est:
  - exports (us mil) = 5,762
  - percent of total exports = 13.8%
  - imports (us mil) = 7,501.9
  - percent of total imports = 11.2%
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT county, "exports (us mil)", "percent of total exports", "imports (us mil)", "percent of total imports"
  FROM list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade
  WHERE county = 'sud - est';

Assessment of the claim
- Claim interpreted: “the export be 6270.2 when the country be vest with a 13.8 percent of total export.”
- Findings:
  - True: For vest, exports are 6,270.2 (US million).
  - False: For vest, the percent of total exports is 15.0%, not 13.8%.
  - The 13.8% share corresponds to sud - est, whose exports are 5,762 (US million), not 6,270.2.

Conclusion
- The claim mixes the export value of vest with the percent share of sud - est. Therefore, it is not fully correct.

Assumptions
- “country” was interpreted as the regional label in the provided table (entries such as “vest” and “sud - est” appear under the column named county).
- Monetary units are taken as million USD, as per the column header “exports (us mil)”.
