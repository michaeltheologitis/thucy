Claim interpreted: “3 home teams have a higher score than the away team they play.” I verified this against the available match data and compared the numeric totals in the score fields.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1938_vfl_season (1938 Victorian Football League data).

Schema overview (relevant fields)
- home team (text): home team name
- home team score (text): score in format like “11.23 (89)” where the number in parentheses is the total points
- away team (text): away team name
- away team score (text): same format as home team score
- date (text): match date

Evidence 1: Inspect sample rows to confirm score format and context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  LIMIT 10;
- Result (abridged): Shows 6 matches dated 18 June 1938 with scores like “11.23 (89)” vs “6.13 (49)”, confirming the total points are the numbers in parentheses and that the table contains that round’s matches.

Evidence 2: Count matches where home total points > away total points (using totals inside parentheses)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_count
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) > CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER);
- Result: 4

Conclusion
- The data show 4 matches in which the home team’s total points exceeded the away team’s, not 3. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “higher score” as the numeric total shown in parentheses in the score fields.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the matches present in the accessible dataset (the round shown in public.t_1938_vfl_season).
