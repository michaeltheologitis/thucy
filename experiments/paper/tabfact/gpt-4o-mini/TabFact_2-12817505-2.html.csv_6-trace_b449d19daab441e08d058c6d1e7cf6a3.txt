Summary conclusion
- Claim: “Manchester United have drawn all matches to Blackburn Rovers (2 out of 2) since 13 August 2005.”
- Finding: Not supported by the data available. In the 2005–06 season data (which covers the period after 13 Aug 2005), Manchester United played Blackburn Rovers twice and lost both matches; there were 0 draws.

Evidence from the database
1) List of matches vs Blackburn Rovers
- Result: Two matches found; both losses (no draws).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "date", "opponents", "h / a", "result f - a" 
FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season 
WHERE "opponents" ILIKE '%Blackburn%';
- Returned rows (as reported by the tool):
  • Date: 24 September 2005 | Opponents: Blackburn Rovers | Home/Away: Home (h) | Result: 1 - 2
  • Date: 1 February 2006 | Opponents: Blackburn Rovers | Home/Away: Away (a) | Result: 3 - 4

2) Count of total matches vs Blackburn Rovers
- Result: 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM public."t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season" 
WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Blackburn%';

3) Count of draws vs Blackburn Rovers
- Result: 0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS draw_count
FROM public."t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season"
WHERE "opponents" ILIKE '%Blackburn%'
AND split_part("result f - a", ' - ', 1) = split_part("result f - a", ' - ', 2);

Assessment
- Within the available season dataset (2005–06, which is after 13 August 2005), Manchester United played Blackburn Rovers twice and did not draw any of those matches. Therefore, the claim that they “drew all matches (2 out of 2)” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and scope
- Available authoritative data covers the 2005–06 Manchester United season only. The phrase “since 13 August 2005” was interpreted within the scope of this dataset. If matches from other seasons after that date were intended, they are outside the provided data source. The matching on opponents used ILIKE '%Blackburn%' to account for potential formatting variations in the opponent name.
