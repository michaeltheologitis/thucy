Claim to verify: “Aldershot Town were the opponent when Bradford City scored their highest point total.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (columns: game, date, opponent, venue, result, attendance). The result field is a scoreline formatted like “X - Y”, where X is Bradford City’s goals and Y is the opponent’s goals.

Method
1) Determine Bradford City’s maximum goals scored in any single match in the available season data.
2) List the match(es) where that maximum occurred and identify the opponent(s).

Findings
- Maximum goals scored by Bradford City in a single match (in this dataset): 5.
- Match where 5 goals were scored:
  - Game 35, Date: 7 March 2009, Opponent: Aldershot Town, Venue: Home, Result: 5 - 0.
- No other matches in the dataset show Bradford City scoring more than 5 goals or equaling 5 goals against any other opponent.

Executed SQL and returned evidence
1) Find the maximum goals scored in a single match:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS max_goals
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season;

Result: max_goals = 5

2) List all matches where Bradford City scored that many goals:
SELECT game, date, opponent, venue, result 
FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season 
WHERE CAST(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1) AS INTEGER) = 5;

Result:
- game: 35 | date: 7 March 2009 | opponent: Aldershot Town | venue: Home | result: 5 - 0

Conclusion
Within the available 2008–09 Bradford City A.F.C. season data, Aldershot Town were indeed the opponent when Bradford City recorded their highest goals scored in a single match (5-0). This supports the essence of the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions and scope
- Interpreted “highest point total” to mean “most goals scored in a single match,” as football points per match are fixed (3/1/0) and the dataset records scorelines, not cumulative league points.
- Verification is limited to the 2008–09 season due to the scope of available data.
