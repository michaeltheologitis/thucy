Claim to verify: “Steve Stricker of United States has the lowest score among all the players.”

Data sources explored
- Available database: public
- Table: t_2006_u_s_open_golf (columns: place, player, country, score, to par)

Key evidence from the data
1) Verify Steve Stricker’s entry
- Result: Found a record for Steve Stricker (United States) with score “70 + 69 = 139” and to par “- 1”.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Stricker%';

2) Determine the lowest total score (parse the trailing total from the score column)
- Step A: Compute the minimum trailing total across all players
  - Result: 139
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(CAST(split_part(score, '=', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS min_total
  FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf;

- Step B: List all players whose trailing total equals the minimum
  - Result: Steve Stricker | United States | place: 1 | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | to par: -1 | parsed_total: 139
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par",
         CAST(split_part(score, '=', 2) AS INTEGER) AS parsed_total
  FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE CAST(split_part(score, '=', 2) AS INTEGER) = (
    SELECT MIN(CAST(split_part(score, '=', 2) AS INTEGER))
    FROM t_2006_u_s_open_golf
  );

3) Cross-check using “to par” (normalize e/E to 0, remove spaces, cast to integer)
- Step A: Find minimum numeric to-par
  - Result: -1
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(TRIM("to par"), ' ', ''), 'e', '0') AS INTEGER)) AS min_numeric_to_par
  FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf;

- Step B: List players with that minimum to-par
  - Result: Steve Stricker | United States | place: 1 | score: 70 + 69 = 139 | original to par: - 1 | parsed numeric_to_par: -1
  - Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par",
         CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(TRIM("to par"), ' ', ''), 'e', '0') AS INTEGER) AS parsed_numeric_to_par
  FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE(TRIM("to par"), ' ', ''), 'e', '0') AS INTEGER) = -1;

Conclusion
- The data shows Steve Stricker (United States) has the lowest total score (139) and the best to-par (-1) in this dataset, and no other player matches these minima. The claim is supported by the evidence in t_2006_u_s_open_golf.

Assumptions
- “Lowest score” refers to the total score represented by the trailing number in the score field (e.g., “= 139”).
- The scope of “among all the players” is the players listed in the t_2006_u_s_open_golf table.
- “United state” in the claim refers to “United States.”
