Summary
- Claim tested: “Each tournament has the same result in the year 1990 and 1999.”
- Data source explored: PostgreSQL database with table public.katrina_adams (tournament rows; year columns including 1990 and 1999).
- Interpretation: For each tournament row, the text value in column "1990" should equal the text value in column "1999". Two NULLs are considered the same; NULL vs non-NULL are different.

Data and Evidence
1) Count total tournaments
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT tournament) AS total_tournaments FROM public.katrina_adams;
Result: 5

2) Count tournaments where 1990 equals 1999 (treating NULLs as equal)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS tournament_count 
FROM katrina_adams 
WHERE COALESCE("1990", 'NULL') = COALESCE("1999", 'NULL');
Result: 1

3) List tournaments where 1990 differs from 1999 (NULL vs non-NULL considered different)
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "1990", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE "1990" IS DISTINCT FROM "1999";
Results:
- Tournament: Australian Open | 1990: 3r | 1999: 1r
- Tournament: French Open     | 1990: 3r | 1999: 1r
- Tournament: Wimbledon       | 1990: 3r | 1999: 1r
- Tournament: US Open         | 1990: 3r | 1999: 1r

Assessment
- Out of 5 tournaments, 4 have different results in 1990 vs 1999, and only 1 has the same result.
- Therefore, it is not true that each tournament has the same result in 1990 and 1999.

Assumptions
- “Result” is the textual entry in the year-specific columns (e.g., 3r, 1r). 
- “Same” means exact string equality, with both NULLs considered equal and NULL vs non-NULL considered different.
- The relevant dataset for “tournaments” is the public.katrina_adams table, which lists tournament rows and year columns for Katrina Adams’ performance.
