Claim to verify: "Windows Live Messenger version 14, made by Microsoft, released on 2010-11-17 under the category of social networking."

Data source consulted: TabFact database, table public.list_of_zune_applications (columns: title, developer, category, "release date", version).

Evidence gathered:
1) Search for any Windows Live/Messenger entries
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE title ILIKE '%Messenger%' OR title ILIKE '%Windows Live%';
- Result:
  Title: windows live messenger
  Developer: microsoft
  Category: social networking
  Release Date: 2010 - 11 - 17
  Version: 1.4

2) Exact title match (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE lower(title)='windows live messenger';
- Result:
  Title: Windows Live Messenger
  Developer: Microsoft
  Category: Social Networking
  Release Date: November 17, 2010
  Version: 1.4

Assessment of each claim component:
- Product: Windows Live Messenger — Supported by data.
- Developer: Microsoft — Supported by data.
- Category: Social Networking — Supported by data.
- Release date: 2010-11-17 — Supported by data (exact match).
- Version: 14 — Not supported; the data shows version 1.4 (with a dot), not 14.

Conclusion: The item exists as a Zune application titled Windows Live Messenger by Microsoft, categorized as Social Networking, released on 2010-11-17, but its version is 1.4, not 14.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Windows Live Messenger entry in the available authoritative dataset (public.list_of_zune_applications). The claim’s spelling (“window live messenger”) was taken to mean “Windows Live Messenger.”
