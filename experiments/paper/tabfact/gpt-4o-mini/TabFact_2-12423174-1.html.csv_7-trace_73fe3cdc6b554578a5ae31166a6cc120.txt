Analysis
- The only matchup recorded between Secteur 6 and Enugu Rangers in the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs shows Enugu Rangers winning 2–1 on aggregate (1–1 first leg, 1–0 second leg). This contradicts the claim that Secteur 6 won.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative dataset for the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs, Secteur 6 did not win against Enugu Rangers; Enugu Rangers won 2–1 on aggregate.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs (the scope of the available dataset). If the claim intended a different year or competition, that is outside the accessible data; conclusions are made strictly within the 1971 dataset.
