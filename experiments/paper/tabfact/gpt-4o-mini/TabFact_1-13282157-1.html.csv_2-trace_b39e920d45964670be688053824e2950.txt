Claim to verify: "99000 be the number of resent point for 23 event".

Interpretation of the claim:
- "resent point" is interpreted as "reset points" (matching a column in the data).
- "23 event" is interpreted as rows where the column "events" equals 23.

Data source discovery:
- Available PostgreSQL tables:
  - public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

Relevant schema:
- Columns in public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs: Unnamed: 0 (bigint), player (text), country (text), points (bigint), events (bigint), reset points (bigint).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 't_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs';

Evidence 1: Check distinct (events, "reset points") pairs
- Result includes: events = 23, reset points = 99000 (count = 1). No other reset-point value appears for events = 23.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "events", "reset points", COUNT(*) as count
  FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
  GROUP BY "events", "reset points"
  ORDER BY "events", "reset points";

Evidence 2: Retrieve the specific row(s) with events = 23
- Row found:
  - Player: Vijay Singh; Country: Fiji; Points: 19129; Events: 23; Reset Points: 99000
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, country, points, events, "reset points" 
  FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs 
  WHERE events = 23;

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows that for the entry with events = 23, the reset points value is 99000. Thus, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- "resent" was a misspelling of "reset".
- "23 event" refers to the events column value of 23, not an event with ID 23 or any other construct.
