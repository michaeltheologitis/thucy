Claim: During the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the matches on February 12 and February 20 both have the same score.

Data sources discovered
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season

Table structure (as available)
- date (text)
- visitor (text)
- score (text)
- home (text)
- decision (text)
- attendance (bigint)
- record (text)

What I checked
- Located the rows corresponding to February 12 and February 20 in the 2007–08 season table and compared the score values.

Findings
- February 12: Minnesota at Edmonton, score 2 - 4
- February 20: Minnesota at Chicago, score 0 - 3
- These scores are not the same.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Targeted retrieval for the two dates
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home 
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season 
WHERE date ILIKE 'February 12%' OR date ILIKE 'February 20%';
Results returned:
- Date: February 12 | Visitor: Minnesota | Score: 2 - 4 | Home: Edmonton
- Date: February 20 | Visitor: Minnesota | Score: 0 - 3 | Home: Chicago

2) Context query used to view February entries (source result excerpted earlier to confirm date formatting in this dataset)
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, decision 
FROM t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
(From the February subset of the returned rows, February 12 shows 2 - 4 and February 20 shows 0 - 3.)

Conclusion
- The scores on February 12 (2 - 4) and February 20 (0 - 3) are different. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Dates “February 12” and “February 20” refer to the 2008 calendar dates within the 2007–08 season. The dataset’s date column is text and lists month-day (and potentially additional text) within this season context.
- “Same score” means an exact match of the score string recorded in the score column (i.e., goals-for – goals-against).
