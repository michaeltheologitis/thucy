Claim to verify: “there be 3 year show when the reader's vote be na and the lifetime achievement be na.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table in the public schema: ned_kelly_awards.
- Table ned_kelly_awards columns:
  - year (bigint)
  - best teenage / young adult (text)
  - reader 's vote (text)
  - best non - fiction (text)
  - lifetime achievement (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count years where both reader's vote and lifetime achievement are the literal string 'na' (case-insensitive, trimmed), and list the years
Result: count = 3; years = [1998, 2000, 2011]
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, ARRAY_AGG("year" ORDER BY "year") AS years
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE LOWER(TRIM("reader 's vote")) = 'na' AND LOWER(TRIM("lifetime achievement")) = 'na';

2) Check if there are years where both fields are NULL (to distinguish literal 'na' from missing values)
Result: count = 0; years = null
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, ARRAY_AGG("year" ORDER BY "year") AS years
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "reader 's vote" IS NULL AND "lifetime achievement" IS NULL;

3) Sensitivity check: treat common missing markers as NA (NULL or one of 'na','n/a','','none','not awarded','-','—')
Result: count = 3; years = [1998, 2000, 2011]
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, ARRAY_AGG("year" ORDER BY "year") AS years
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE ("reader 's vote" IS NULL OR LOWER(TRIM("reader 's vote")) IN ('na','n/a','','none','not awarded','-','—'))
AND ("lifetime achievement" IS NULL OR LOWER(TRIM("lifetime achievement")) IN ('na','n/a','','none','not awarded','-','—'));

4) Reference: observed normalized values frequency in both columns
Summary of relevant findings: 'na' appears 14 times in reader's vote and 3 times in lifetime achievement.
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(TRIM("reader 's vote")) AS normalized_value, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY normalized_value
UNION ALL
SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(TRIM("lifetime achievement")) AS normalized_value, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
GROUP BY normalized_value;

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 3 years (1998, 2000, 2011) where both reader's vote and lifetime achievement are recorded as 'na'. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “na” in the claim as the literal string 'na' (case-insensitive) in the dataset; verification also checked the NULL/missing case, which yielded 0 matching years, confirming that 'na' is used as a value rather than a SQL NULL in these fields.
- Interpreted “year show” as the number of year records (rows) in the ned_kelly_awards table.
