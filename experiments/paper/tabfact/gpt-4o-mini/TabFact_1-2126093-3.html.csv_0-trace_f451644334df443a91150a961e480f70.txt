Claim interpreted: “the winner of the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open ended 2 under par (−2).”

What I checked
- I searched the available TabFact database (public schema) for entries related to the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open in the ai_miyazato table, which records Ai Miyazato’s tournament wins and details, including final score to par.

Evidence from data
1) Query to find relevant tournaments by keyword
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, "winning score", "to par" FROM ai_miyazato WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Miyagi%';

Result rows:
- Date: 28 Sep 2003
  Tournament: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open (as an Amateur)
  Winning Score: 70 + 70 + 71 = 211
  To Par: -5

- Date: 24 Sep 2006
  Tournament: Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open
  Winning Score: 70 + 73 + 71 = 214
  To Par: -2

Assessment
- The statement is true for the 24 Sep 2006 edition, where the winner (Ai Miyazato) finished at −2 to par.
- It is not universally true for all editions found in this dataset: in 2003, the winner (Ai Miyazato, as an amateur) finished at −5.

Conclusion
- The claim is correct for the 2006 Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open, but not for the 2003 edition listed in the data.

Assumptions
- “donlop lady open” is interpreted as “Dunlop Ladies Open.”
- The claim refers to the event tracked in the ai_miyazato table, which lists Ai Miyazato’s wins.
- Because no specific year was provided, I evaluated all occurrences of this tournament in the available data.
