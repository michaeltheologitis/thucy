Claim to verify: No two players attend the same “college / junior / club team (league)”.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season (Philadelphia Flyers 2004–05 season).

Relevant schema (summarized):
- Columns: round (bigint), player (text), position (text), nationality (text), college / junior / club team (league) (text). No primary/foreign keys.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count non-null vs distinct team entries
- Result: total_non_null = 11; distinct_values = 11
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_non_null,
         COUNT(DISTINCT NULLIF(TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)"), '')) AS distinct_values
  FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  WHERE "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL;

2) Attempt to list any repeated team values with associated players (exact-match, trimmed)
- Result: No rows returned (no duplicates)
- SQL:
  SELECT "college / junior / club team (league)", STRING_AGG(player, ', ') AS players, COUNT(*) AS occurrence_count
  FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  WHERE "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL
  GROUP BY "college / junior / club team (league)"
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

3) Sanity check on counts and nulls
- Result: total players = 11; NULLs in the team column = 0; NOT NULL = 11
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_players,
         SUM(CASE WHEN "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS null_count,
         SUM(CASE WHEN "college / junior / club team (league)" IS NOT NULL THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS not_null_count
  FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season;

4) Case-insensitive duplicate check (trimmed)
- Result: distinct_count (case-insensitive) = 11; no duplicate groups found
- SQL (distinct count):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT LOWER(TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)"))) AS distinct_count FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season;
- SQL (groups > 1, case-insensitive):
  SELECT LOWER(TRIM("college / junior / club team (league)")) AS team, COUNT(*) AS player_count
  FROM t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
  GROUP BY team
  HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Conclusion: All 11 players have non-null entries for “college / junior / club team (league)”, and all 11 entries are unique (both exact-match after trimming and case-insensitive). Therefore, no two players share the same entry in that column.

Assumptions:
- “Attend the same” is interpreted as having identical text values in the column “college / junior / club team (league)”, evaluated after trimming whitespace; we also confirmed no duplicates on a case-insensitive basis.
- Verification is scoped to the table t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season, the only available roster dataset in the connected data source.
