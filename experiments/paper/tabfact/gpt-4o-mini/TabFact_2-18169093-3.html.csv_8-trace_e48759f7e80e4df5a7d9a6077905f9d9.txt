Claim to verify:
“In the 1981 Open Championship the winning score was 72, with a 2‑player tie for this score: Isao Aoki and David Graham.”

What the data shows (t_1981_open_championship):
- The table records places (with ties), player names, scores, and to-par values for the 1981 Open Championship.
- The lowest score (place t1) is 70 (E), and the two players tied at that score are Vicente Fernández and Nick Job.
- Isao Aoki and David Graham are both listed at place t3 with scores of 71 (+1).
- Score 72 (+2) corresponds to multiple players at place t9 and does not include Isao Aoki or David Graham.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) Winners (t1) and their scores
SQL:
SELECT player, score, "to par" FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't1'
Result (abridged):
- Vicente Fernández | 70 | E
- Nick Job | 70 | E

2) All rows, ordered by player (to confirm Aoki and Graham)
SQL:
SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM t_1981_open_championship ORDER BY player;
Result excerpt:
- …
- t3 | David Graham | 71 | + 1
- t3 | Isao Aoki | 71 | + 1
- t1 | Nick Job | 70 | e
- t1 | Vicente Fernández | 70 | e
- …

3) All players who scored 72
SQL:
SELECT place, player, "to par" FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE score = 72 ORDER BY player;
Result (abridged):
- t9 | Arnold Palmer | + 2
- t9 | Ben Crenshaw | + 2
- t9 | Bill Rogers | + 2
- t9 | David Jagger | + 2
- t9 | Greg Norman | + 2
- t9 | Howard Clark | + 2
- t9 | Mark James | + 2
- t9 | Sam Torrance | + 2

Conclusion:
- The winning score is 70 (E), tied by Vicente Fernández and Nick Job—not 72.
- Isao Aoki and David Graham are tied at 71 (+1), not at 72, and they are not the winners in this dataset.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions noted:
- Interpretation is based solely on the available table t_1981_open_championship, which uses place codes like t1/t3/t9 and appears to summarize standings for the referenced event. All conclusions are grounded in this dataset’s contents.
