Claim to verify: “Federico Delbonis was the opponent in the final of the 28 July 2013 tournament, which did not have a clay surface.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public and a table named fabio_fognini.
- Examined the table schema to understand available fields relevant to finals, dates, opponents, and surfaces.

Relevant schema (summary)
- Table: public.fabio_fognini
- Columns (text unless noted): outcome, date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", "score in the final"

3) Targeted check for any final vs Federico Delbonis (date and surface)

Assessment
- On 28 July 2013, Fabio Fognini’s final opponent was Tommy Robredo, not Federico Delbonis.
- The 28 July 2013 tournament (ATP Vegeta Croatia Open Umag) was played on clay, not on a non-clay surface.
- Federico Delbonis was Fognini’s opponent one week earlier, on 21 July 2013, at Hamburg (also on clay).

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data: Federico Delbonis was not the opponent on 28 July 2013, and the 28 July 2013 tournament surface was clay, not a non-clay surface.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “the final of the 28 July 2013 tournament” as referring to Fabio Fognini’s ATP final dated 28 July 2013 as recorded in the fabio_fognini table.
- Interpreted “do not have a clay surface” as asserting the tournament surface was not clay.
