Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema.
- Queried the database for evidence of any “Goose River” bridge near McVille and for the status of any relevant structures.

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: my_info_table (columns: name, listed, location, county, type). No keys or status fields were present.

Evidence collected (with executed SQL)
1) Identify any records located in McVille
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE '%McVille%';
- Result:
  Name: nesheim bridge; Listed: 1997 - 02 - 27; Location: mcville; County: nelson; Type: pratt through truss

2) Identify any records mentioning “Goose River”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%Goose River%' OR location ILIKE '%Goose River%';
- Result:
  Name: goose river bridge; Listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25; Location: hillsboro; County: traill; Type: pratt through truss

3) Check whether any McVille record’s name mentions “Goose” or “River”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name FROM my_info_table WHERE location ILIKE '%McVille%' AND (name ILIKE '%Goose%' OR name ILIKE '%River%');
- Result: No rows returned (no mentions of “Goose” or “River” in names for McVille records).

4) Broad search for any occurrence of “goose” in any column
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%goose%' OR listed ILIKE '%goose%' OR location ILIKE '%goose%' OR county ILIKE '%goose%' OR type ILIKE '%goose%';
- Result:
  Name: goose river bridge; Listed: 1997 - 02 - 27 removed 2009 - 3 - 25; Location: hillsboro; County: traill; Type: pratt through truss

Assessment of the claim
- The database shows a bridge in McVille named “Nesheim Bridge” (Nelson County), not “Goose River Bridge.”
- The only record explicitly named “Goose River Bridge” is located in Hillsboro (Traill County), not McVille.
- The table does not contain any status or condition fields indicating a structure is “currently under construction” or has “structural issues.” Therefore, there is no data supporting that the McVille bridge is under construction due to structural problems.

Conclusion
- The claim that McVille has a “Goose River bridge” is not supported by the data; McVille’s listed bridge is “Nesheim Bridge.”
- The assertion that it is “currently under construction due to structural issue” is not supported by any available data in this database.

Assumptions made
- “mcville” refers to McVille, North Dakota (Nelson County).
- “goose river bridge” refers to a structure explicitly named “Goose River Bridge,” rather than any bridge over any branch of the Goose River.
- “currently” refers to the present timeframe, but the database lacks temporal status fields to verify ongoing construction or structural conditions.
