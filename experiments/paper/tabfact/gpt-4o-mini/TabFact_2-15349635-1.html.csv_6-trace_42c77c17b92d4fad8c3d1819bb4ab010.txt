Claim to verify: "the second team have less point than the first and be separate by a 2 goal difference"

Data sources consulted
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1940_in_brazilian_football (columns: position, team, points, played, against, difference)

Decomposition of the claim
1) The second team has fewer points than the first.
2) They are separated by a 2-goal difference.

Evidence
1) Top two teams by position with parsed goal difference
Executed SQL:
SELECT position, team, points, CAST(REPLACE(difference, '+', '') AS INTEGER) AS parsed_goal_difference  
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football  
WHERE position IN (1, 2)  
ORDER BY position;

Result:
- Position: 1, Team: Flamengo, Points: 13, Parsed Goal Difference: 8
- Position: 2, Team: Fluminense, Points: 13, Parsed Goal Difference: 10

2) Comparative check of points and goal-difference gap
Executed SQL:
SELECT  
  (SELECT points FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 2) <  
  (SELECT points FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 1) AS is_position_2_less_than_position_1,  
  ABS(
    (SELECT CAST(REPLACE(difference, '+', '') AS INTEGER) FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 1) -  
    (SELECT CAST(REPLACE(difference, '+', '') AS INTEGER) FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football WHERE position = 2)
  ) AS absolute_goal_difference
;

Result:
- is_position_2_less_than_position_1: false
- absolute_goal_difference: 2

Findings
- Sub-claim 1 (second has fewer points): Not supported. Both first and second have 13 points.
- Sub-claim 2 (separated by 2 goal difference): Supported. The absolute difference in goal difference between positions 1 and 2 is 2 (10 vs 8).

Conclusion
- The claim mixes one false and one true component. Overall, it is not accurate because the core statement about points is wrong.

Assumptions made
- "First" and "second" refer to position = 1 and position = 2 in the table.
- "Goal difference" corresponds to the 'difference' column, parsed as an integer (stripping a leading '+' if present).
- "Separated by a 2 goal difference" is interpreted as the absolute difference between the two teams’ goal-difference values equals 2.
- Verification is based solely on the available 1940 Brazilian football standings data in the provided table.
