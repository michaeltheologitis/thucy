Claim: “the solheim cup be host in the united state 6 time from 1990 - 2013.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.solheim_cup containing Solheim Cup years and venues.

Evidence 1: List all events from 1990–2013 with venues
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, venue FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 ORDER BY year ASC;
- Results:
  - 1990: Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA
  - 1992: Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland
  - 1994: The Greenbrier, West Virginia, USA
  - 1996: St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales
  - 1998: Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA
  - 2000: Loch Lomond Golf Club, Scotland
  - 2002: Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA
  - 2003: Barsebäck Golf & Country Club, Sweden
  - 2005: Crooked Stick Golf Club, Indiana, USA
  - 2007: Halmstad GK, Sweden
  - 2009: Rich Harvest Farms, Illinois, USA
  - 2011: Killeen Castle Golf Resort, Ireland
  - 2013: Colorado Golf Club, Colorado, USA

Evidence 2: Identify and count United States hosts in 1990–2013
- Executed SQL to list US-hosted entries:
  SELECT year, venue FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND (venue ILIKE '%USA%' OR venue ILIKE '%United States%') ORDER BY year;
- Matching years and venues (7 total): 1990 (FL, USA); 1994 (WV, USA); 1998 (OH, USA); 2002 (MN, USA); 2005 (IN, USA); 2009 (IL, USA); 2013 (CO, USA)

- Executed SQL to return only the count:
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM public.solheim_cup 
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 
  AND (venue ILIKE '%USA%' OR venue ILIKE '%United States%') 
  AND venue IS NOT NULL;
- Result: 7

Conclusion:
- From 1990 through 2013 (inclusive), the Solheim Cup was hosted in the United States 7 times, not 6. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “From 1990 - 2013” is interpreted as inclusive of both years.
- A venue string containing “USA” or “United States” indicates hosting in the United States.
