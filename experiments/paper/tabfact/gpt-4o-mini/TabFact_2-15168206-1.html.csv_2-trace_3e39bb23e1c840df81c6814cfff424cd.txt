Claim interpreted: The game “Spy v Spy” (aka “Spy vs Spy”) is listed under the Arcade genre and associated with the Dragon 32 platform in the available dataset.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: beyond_software (columns: title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format)

Evidence 1: Does “Spy vs Spy” exist and what is its genre and platforms?
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format 
FROM public.beyond_software 
WHERE title ILIKE '%Spy vs Spy%' OR title ILIKE '%Spy v Spy%' OR title ILIKE '%Spy Vs. Spy%';

Result:
- title: spy vs spy
- genre: arcade
- c = 64: c64
- zx spectrum: zx spectrum
- others: amstrad cpc
- year: 1984
- format: tape

Finding: “Spy vs Spy” is listed with genre “arcade” and platforms C64, ZX Spectrum, and Amstrad CPC. No Dragon 32 indicated.

Evidence 2: Is Dragon 32 referenced anywhere in the table (to confirm platform encoding)?
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, genre, "c = 64", "zx spectrum", others, year, format 
FROM public.beyond_software 
WHERE title ILIKE '%dragon 32%' 
   OR genre ILIKE '%dragon 32%' 
   OR "c = 64" ILIKE '%dragon 32%' 
   OR "zx spectrum" ILIKE '%dragon 32%' 
   OR others ILIKE '%dragon 32%' 
   OR format ILIKE '%dragon 32%';

Sample results that mention Dragon 32:
- kriegspiel — others: dragon 32
- up periscope — others: dragon 32

Finding: The dataset encodes Dragon 32 under the “others” column for certain titles, confirming how the platform would appear if applicable. “Spy vs Spy” does not list Dragon 32.

Conclusion:
- True: “Spy vs Spy” is listed under the Arcade genre.
- False: It is not listed with the Dragon 32 platform (platforms shown: C64, ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC).

Assumptions:
- “Spy v Spy” refers to “Spy vs Spy.”
- Verification is constrained to the TabFact.public.beyond_software dataset described above.
