Claim to verify: "mark cockerell finish with a worse score than partice macrez"

Data source discovery:
- Available database contains a single table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships (1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships results).

Schema details for public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships:
- Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), "sp + fs" (bigint), points (double precision), places (double precision)

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation, "sp + fs", points, places 
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Cockerell%' OR name ILIKE '%Macrez%' 
ORDER BY rank ASC;

- Returned rows:
  - Rank: 1 | Name: Mark Cockerell | Nation: United States | sp + fs: 1 | Points: 172.42 | Places: 11
  - Rank: 7 | Name: Patrice Macrez | Nation: France | sp + fs: 6 | Points: 151.76 | Places: 71

Assessment:
- Higher points and lower places indicate a better performance. Mark Cockerell has more points (172.42 vs 151.76) and a better rank (1 vs 7) than Patrice Macrez. Therefore, Mark Cockerell did not finish with a worse score; he finished better.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "partice macrez" refers to Patrice Macrez.
- "finish" and "score" are interpreted within the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships dataset, with "score" corresponding to the points column.
