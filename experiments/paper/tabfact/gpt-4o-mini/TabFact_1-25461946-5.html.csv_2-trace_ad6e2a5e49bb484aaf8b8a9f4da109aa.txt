Claim checked: “only 1 game be play on november 27.” Interpreted within the available data source (Temple Owls men’s basketball 2009–10 season), this means: There was exactly one Temple game on November 27 during that season.

Data source: PostgreSQL table t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team (columns include: game, date, team, score, etc.). Dates are stored as text like “November 27”.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Inspect sample rows to confirm date format and presence of November entries
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score FROM t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team LIMIT 20;
Result (excerpt): shows “Game 5 | Date: November 27 | Team: Virginia Tech | Score: W 61 - 50”.

2) Count games on November 27 (case-insensitive, to avoid potential text nuances)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%november 27%';
Result: row_count = 1.

3) List the game(s) on November 27 for confirmation
SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score FROM t_2009_10_temple_owls_men_s_basketball_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%november 27%';
Result: Game 5, Date: November 27, Opponent: Virginia Tech, Score: W 61 - 50.

Conclusion: The dataset shows exactly one game on November 27.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Temple Owls 2009–10 men’s basketball season (the only available data source).
- “November 27” refers to the month-day within that season’s schedule; the table stores dates without year.
