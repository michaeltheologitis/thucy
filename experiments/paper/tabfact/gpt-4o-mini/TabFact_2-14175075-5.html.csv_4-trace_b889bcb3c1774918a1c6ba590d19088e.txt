Claim interpreted: In the 2007 entries of the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series dataset, wrestling is the sport that occurs on the latest (most recent) calendar date.

Evidence from the data
1) Inspect 2007 entries (sample) to understand date formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, sport 
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
WHERE date LIKE '%2007%' 
ORDER BY date ASC 
LIMIT 50;
Returned sample rows include (abridged):
- december 5 , 2007 | w basketball
- december 7 , 2007 | w swimming
- december 8 , 2007 | m basketball
- december 9 , 2007 | wrestling
- november 10 , 2007 | w cross country
- november 10 , 2007 | m cross country
- september 15 , 2007 | football
- september 4 , 2007 | m golf
- september 8 , 2007 | volleyball
- september 9 , 2007 | w soccer

2) Find the latest calendar date in 2007 by parsing the text dates and aggregating sports on that date
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')) AS latest_date, ARRAY_AGG(sport) AS sports
FROM iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY') BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2007-12-31'
GROUP BY TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')
ORDER BY latest_date DESC
LIMIT 1;
Result: latest_date = 2007-12-09; sports = {wrestling}

3) List all rows on the latest 2007 date to confirm the sport(s)
Executed SQL (step 1):
SELECT MAX(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY')) AS max_date
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY') >= '2007-01-01' AND TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY') <= '2007-12-31';
Result: 2007-12-09

Executed SQL (step 2):
SELECT date, sport
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD , YYYY') = '2007-12-09';
Result: Date = December 9, 2007; Sport = Wrestling

Conclusion
- The latest calendar date in 2007 in the dataset is December 9, 2007, and the corresponding sport on that date is Wrestling. No other sport appears on that date. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Iowa Corn Cy-Hawk Series dataset available here.
- “Latest date in 2007” means the most recent calendar date within the year 2007 among all records in the dataset.
- The date parsing uses the format 'Month DD , YYYY' to convert the text 'date' column into a date value for comparison.
