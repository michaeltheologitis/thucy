Evidence
1) Presence and team for Ricky Rudd in pocono_400
- Result: Ricky Rudd appears in 2001 with team Robert Yates Racing; no entries show Ricky Rudd with Joe Gibbs Racing.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, driver, team, manufacturer, laps FROM pocono_400 WHERE LOWER(driver) LIKE '%rudd%'
- Returned rows:
  | Year | Driver     | Team                 | Manufacturer | Laps |
  | 2001 | Ricky Rudd | Robert Yates Racing  | Ford         | 200  |

SELECT year, driver, team FROM pocono_400 WHERE LOWER(driver) = 'ricky rudd' ORDER BY year;
- Returned rows:
  Year: 2001 | Driver: Ricky Rudd | Team: Robert Yates Racing

- Executed SQL:

- Returned rows: none

2) How “Joe Gibbs Racing” appears in this dataset (sanity check)
- Result: Joe Gibbs Racing entries exist for other drivers, confirming the team name is represented in this table when applicable.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT driver, year FROM pocono_400 WHERE LOWER(team) = LOWER('Joe Gibbs Racing')
- Returned rows (distinct):
  - Bobby Labonte — 1999
  - Tony Stewart — 2003
  - Denny Hamlin — 2006
  - Denny Hamlin — 2010

Conclusion
- In the authoritative dataset available, Ricky Rudd’s recorded team at the Pocono 400 is Robert Yates Racing (2001). There are no occurrences linking Ricky Rudd to Joe Gibbs Racing in this dataset, while Joe Gibbs Racing is correctly associated with other drivers. Therefore, the claim that Ricky Rudd’s team is Joe Gibbs Racing is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- The user’s statement is interpreted as asserting that Ricky Rudd’s team (in NASCAR Cup competition) is/was Joe Gibbs Racing. Verification is performed against the available Pocono 400 dataset, which we treat as authoritative within its scope.
