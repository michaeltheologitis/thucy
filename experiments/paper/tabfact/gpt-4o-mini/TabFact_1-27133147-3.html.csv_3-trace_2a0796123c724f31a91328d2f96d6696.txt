Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and examined its schema to locate fields relevant to coach changes (vacancy dates and incoming head coaches).
- Queried the table for the record where the incoming head coach is Carlos Azenha and examined the “date of vacancy”.
- Compared the recorded date against the claim.

Data source and schema
- Database: Primeira Liga 2010-2011 (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2010_11_primeira_liga
- Columns: team (text), outgoing head coach (text), manner of departure (text), date of vacancy (text), position in table (text), incoming head coach (text), date of appointment (text)

Evidence
1) Executed SQL:
SELECT team, "outgoing head coach", "date of vacancy", "incoming head coach", "date of appointment" 
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga 
WHERE "incoming head coach" IS NOT NULL;

Result snippet relevant to Carlos Azenha (summarized by the tool):
- Team: Portimonense
- Outgoing Head Coach: Litos
- Date of Vacancy: 28 December 2011
- Incoming Head Coach: Carlos Azenha
- Date of Appointment: 29 December 2010

2) Executed SQL (targeted):
SELECT team, "outgoing head coach", "manner of departure", "date of vacancy", "incoming head coach", "date of appointment" 
FROM t_2010_11_primeira_liga 
WHERE LOWER("incoming head coach") = LOWER('Carlos Azenha');

Returned row:
- Team: Portimonense
- Outgoing Head Coach: Litos
- Manner of Departure: Sacked
- Date of Vacancy: 28 December 2011
- Incoming Head Coach: Carlos Azenha
- Date of Appointment: 29 December 2010

Assessment against the claim
- Claim: “the date of vacancy be after 28 december 2011 with the incoming head coach, carlos azenha.”
- Data shows the date of vacancy for the record with incoming head coach Carlos Azenha is exactly 28 December 2011.
- Interpreting “after 28 December 2011” as strictly later than that date (i.e., > 2011-12-28), the recorded date (equal to 2011-12-28) does not satisfy “after”.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data: the vacancy date is on 28 December 2011, not after it.

Assumptions
- “After” is interpreted as strictly later than the stated date (not inclusive).
- The “Carlos Azenha” referenced is the manager listed in the Primeira Liga 2010-2011 dataset for Portimonense.
