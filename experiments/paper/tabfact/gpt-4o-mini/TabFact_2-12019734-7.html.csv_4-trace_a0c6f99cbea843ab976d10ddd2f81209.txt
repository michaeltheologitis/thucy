Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single relevant table containing game matchups.
- Inspected schema to understand columns and their meanings.
- Queried for rows where the home team contains "Chicago" and the visiting team contains "New Jersey".

Relevant schema:
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text)

Evidence found (games where Chicago is home and New Jersey is visitor):
- Date: February 9 | Home: Chicago | Visitor: New Jersey | Score: 4 - 5 | Record: 11 - 34 - 12

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT date, home, visitor, score, record FROM my_info_table WHERE home ILIKE '%Chicago%' AND visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' ORDER BY date ASC;

Conclusion:
- In the available dataset, there is one game where Chicago was the home team and New Jersey was the visiting team, on February 9 (year not specified in the data).

Assumptions:
- Interpreted your request as: “List the games/dates when Chicago is the home team and New Jersey is the visitor.”
- Treated the available dataset as authoritative and complete within its scope.
- Used case-insensitive matching for team names (e.g., any team name containing “Chicago” and “New Jersey”).
- No sport or league disambiguation was performed beyond the text fields present in the table.
