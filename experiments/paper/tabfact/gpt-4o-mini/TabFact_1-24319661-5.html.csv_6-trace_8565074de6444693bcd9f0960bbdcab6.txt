Claim to verify: "episode number 10 of the season have bcw410 as a production code and an air date of september 11, 2012"

Summary of findings based on the available data source (White Collar episodes):
- The dataset contains a single relevant table: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes.
- For the episode where "no in season" = 10, the record shows:
  - Title: Vested Interest
  - Production code: bcw410
  - Original air date: September 18, 2012
- Therefore, the production code matches the claim (bcw410), but the air date does not (the data shows September 18, 2012, not September 11, 2012).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify table structure to identify relevant columns
- Result: Table includes columns "no in season", "production code", and "original air date" among others.
- Executed SQL to list columns:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'list_of_white_collar_episodes';

2) Retrieve the episode with episode number 10 in the season
- Result:
  - No in Series: 56
  - No in Season: 10
  - Title: Vested Interest
  - Production Code: bcw410
  - Original Air Date: September 18, 2012
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "production code", "original air date" FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes WHERE "no in season" = 10;

Conclusion
- Production code: supported (bcw410)
- Air date: contradicted by the data (should be September 18, 2012, not September 11, 2012)

Assumptions
- "episode number 10 of the season" refers to the episode with "no in season" = 10 in the available White Collar episodes dataset. The dataset appears to include (at least) the season containing the episode titled "Vested Interest" (Season 4), and the "original air date" is treated as the U.S. original air date, consistent with the presence of the "us viewers (million)" column.
