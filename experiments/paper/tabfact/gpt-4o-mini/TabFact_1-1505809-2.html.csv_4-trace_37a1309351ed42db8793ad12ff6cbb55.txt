Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as a data statement about the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier table: “pf equals 67 when ends lost equals 40.” Here, pf = Points For and ends lost = Ends Lost.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
- Relevant columns: pf (bigint), ends lost (bigint) among others (locale, skip, w, l, pa, ends won, blank ends, stolen ends, shot pct).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve rows where ends lost = 40
SQL:
SELECT locale, skip, pf
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "ends lost" = 40;
Result:
- locale: Quebec; skip: Jean - Michel Mãnard; pf: 77

2) Count rows with ends lost = 40 and check any row with pf = 67
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "ends lost" = 40;
Result: 1
SQL (pf = 67):
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE pf = 67;
Result:
- locale: Prince Edward Island; skip: Rod MacDonald; w: 4; l: 7; pf: 67; pa: 85; ends won: 41; ends lost: 51; blank ends: 12; stolen ends: 5; shot pct: 79%

3) Full row for ends lost = 40 (to confirm pf)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "ends lost" = 40;
Result:
- locale: quebec; skip: jean - michel mãnard; w: 7; l: 4; pf: 77; pa: 69; ends won: 54; ends lost: 40; blank ends: 8; stolen ends: 15; shot pct: 80%

Assessment
- The only row with ends lost = 40 has pf = 77, not 67.
- A row with pf = 67 exists, but its ends lost = 51, not 40.

Conclusion
- The claim “67 be the pf when end lost be 40” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "pf" means Points For and "end lost" means Ends Lost in the t_2005_tim_hortons_brier table.
- The claim refers to a factual relationship within this table. Minor variations in name capitalization/diacritics are not material to the numeric verification.
