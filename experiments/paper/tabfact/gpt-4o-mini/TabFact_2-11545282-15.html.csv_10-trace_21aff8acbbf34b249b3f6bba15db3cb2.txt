Summary
- I surveyed the available data sources and found a single authoritative table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster, which lists Utah Jazz players along with nationality, position, years for Jazz, and their school/club team.
- I searched for any player whose school/club team is Efes Pilsen (Turkey) and checked the recorded position.

Findings
- The only matching entry is Mehmet Okur, whose position is recorded as "Forward - Center" and whose school/club team is "Efes Pilsen (Turkey)". This means his position includes Center but is not solely Center.

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) Query targeting Efes Pilsen explicitly:
SELECT player, position, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Efes Pilsen%';

Result:
- Player: Mehmet Okur | Position: Forward - Center | Nationality: Turkey | Years for Jazz: 2004 - 2011 | School / Club Team: Efes Pilsen (Turkey)

2) Broader check for any 'Efes' mentions:
SELECT player, position, nationality, "school / club team" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Efes%';

Result:
- Player: Mehmet Okur | Position: Forward - Center | Nationality: Turkey | School / Club Team: Efes Pilsen (Turkey)

Conclusion
- If the claim is that the player associated with Efes Pilsen (Turkey) has the position Center, the data shows the position is recorded as "Forward - Center"—which includes Center but is not exclusively Center.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Utah Jazz player whose school/club team is Efes Pilsen (Turkey) in the available roster table.
- Interpreted “the position be center” as asserting the player’s listed position is Center exclusively.
