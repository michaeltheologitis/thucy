Claim interpreted: After 2005, the only people to win the Lifetime Achievement award (in years when Best Non-Fiction and Reader’s Vote were “na”) were Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day.

Data discovery: A Ned Kelly Awards database is available with a single table containing award results by year and category.

Schema overview (as reported by the data source):
- Table: public.ned_kelly_awards
- Columns:
  - year (bigint)
  - best teenage / young adult (text)
  - reader 's vote (text)
  - best non - fiction (text)
  - lifetime achievement (text)

Evidence 1: Post-2005 results (years ≥ 2006)
SQL:
SELECT "year", "best non - fiction", "reader 's vote", "lifetime achievement"
FROM public.ned_kelly_awards
WHERE "year" >= 2006
ORDER BY "year";

Result returned by the data source:
- 2006 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: Andrew Rule and John Silvester
- 2007 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson
- 2008 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: Marele Day
- 2009 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: Shane Maloney
- 2010 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: Peter Doyle
- 2011 | best non - fiction: na | reader's vote: na | lifetime achievement: na

Evidence 2: Full table (context and earlier years)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.ned_kelly_awards;

Selected relevant rows from the result (focusing on Lifetime Achievement for context):
- 1996: jon cleary
- 1997: alan yates (aka carter brown)
- 1999: peter corris
- 2001: professor stephen knight
- 2002: patrick gallagher
- 2003: kerry greenwood
- 2004: bob bottom
- 2005: stuart coupe
- 2006: andrew rule and john silvester
- 2007: sandra harvey and lindsay simpson
- 2008: marele day
- 2009: shane maloney
- 2010: peter doyle
- 2011: na

Findings:
- After 2005 (i.e., 2006–2010), Best Non-Fiction and Reader’s Vote are recorded as “na” in every year returned.
- In those same years, Lifetime Achievement recipients were: 2006 Andrew Rule and John Silvester; 2007 Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson; 2008 Marele Day; 2009 Shane Maloney; 2010 Peter Doyle.
- The claim lists Andrew Rule, John Silvester, Sandra Harvey, Lindsay Simpson, and Marele Day, but omits two additional recipients from this period with the same conditions (Shane Maloney in 2009 and Peter Doyle in 2010).

Conclusion: The set of Lifetime Achievement winners after 2005 in years when Best Non-Fiction and Reader’s Vote are “na” is larger than stated. Therefore, the “only” part of the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “after the year 2005” interpreted as years 2006 and later.
- “na” is interpreted as no award/winner recorded for that category.
- Name spellings are matched to the data source (e.g., John Silvester).
