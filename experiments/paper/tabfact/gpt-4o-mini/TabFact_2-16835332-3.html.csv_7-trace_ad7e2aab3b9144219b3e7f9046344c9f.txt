Summary of claim
Claim interpreted: “The total of rebound average for records with more than 124 games and a rank of 10 is 6.2.”

Data discovery
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with schema public.
- Single table: public.my_info_table (relevant to basketball rebound stats).

Schema inspection (from schema tool)
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Rank: bigint
  - Player: text
  - Years: text
  - Games: bigint
  - Rebound Average: double precision
  - Total Rebounds: bigint

Verification steps and evidence
Step 1: Retrieve rows with Games > 124 and Rank = 10 and inspect rebound averages.
- Executed SQL (as run by the query tool):
  SELECT "player", "years", "games", "rank", "reb avg", "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "games" > 124 AND "rank" = 10;
- Result: Empty result set (no rows matched).

Step 2: Compute the sum of Rebound Average for the same filter.
- Executed SQL (as run by the query tool):
  SELECT SUM("reb avg") AS total_rebound_average, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "games" > 124 AND "rank" = 10;
- Result: total_rebound_average = null, row_count = 0.

Findings
- There are no records where Games > 124 and Rank = 10 in the dataset. Therefore, the sum (total) of Rebound Average under this filter is null (effectively zero rows), not 6.2.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. No rows meet the specified criteria, so the total of rebound average cannot be 6.2.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “total of rebound average with more than 124 game and a rank of 10” as: filter records where Games > 124 and Rank = 10, then take the SUM of the Rebound Average column. If the intent was instead to assert a single player’s Rebound Average equals 6.2 under those constraints, the conclusion remains the same because no such record exists.
