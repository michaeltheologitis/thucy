Claim to verify: “herb estes have 708 rebound.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema
- Table: my_info_table
- Columns: rank (bigint), player (text), years (text), games (bigint), reb avg (double precision), total rebounds (bigint)

Evidence
1) Exact name match (case-insensitive) for Herb Estes
SQL executed:
SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Herb Estes');
Result:
- player: herb estes
- years: 1973 - 1976
- games: 80
- reb avg: 9.2
- total rebounds: 734

2) Name contains “estes” (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
FROM my_info_table
WHERE LOWER(player) LIKE '%estes%';
Result:
- player: Herb Estes
- years: 1973 - 1976
- games: 80
- reb avg: 9.2
- total rebounds: 734

Assessment
- The authoritative table shows Herb Estes with 734 total rebounds, not 708.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Herb Estes’ total rebounds are 734 per the available data source.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the same “Herb Estes” present in the data and to his total career rebounds across the listed years (1973–1976). If a different context (e.g., a single season or different league) was intended, that is not represented in the available dataset.
