Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that 4 of the competitions in the dataset are Senior World Championships (i.e., World Championships at senior level, not junior or age-group meets).

Data source and structure inspected
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a single table: public.luk_melich.
- Schema details (via schema inspection):
  - Table: luk_melich(year bigint, competition text, venue text, position text, notes text)

Evidence gathered
1) Distinct competition names present
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT competition FROM public.luk_melich;
- Result (summarized): World Championships; Olympic Games; Universiade; European Championships; European Junior Championships; European U23 Championships; World Junior Championships.

2) All rows containing World and Champ in competition (to capture both senior and junior world championships)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes 
  FROM public.luk_melich 
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%World%Champ%' 
  ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  - 1998 — World Junior Championships — Annecy, France — 10th — 61.51 m
  - 2005 — World Championships — Helsinki, Finland — 14th — 74.53 m
  - 2009 — World Championships — Berlin, Germany — 14th — 74.47 m
  - 2013 — World Championships — Moscow, Russia — 3rd — 79.36 m

3) Count occurrences of each world-championship-type competition (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT competition, LENGTH(competition) AS len, COUNT(*) AS cnt 
  FROM public.luk_melich 
  WHERE competition ILIKE '%World%Champ%' 
  GROUP BY competition 
  ORDER BY cnt DESC;
- Result:
  - world championships — count: 3
  - world junior championships — count: 1

4) Full table listing for context
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes FROM public.luk_melich ORDER BY year;
- Result confirms that the dataset contains three entries labeled World Championships (senior) in 2005, 2009, and 2013, plus one World Junior Championships in 1998.

Conclusion
- Senior World Championships (competition labeled “World Championships”): 3 entries.
- The claim that 4 of the competitions are Senior World Championships is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Senior World Championship” is interpreted as entries where competition equals the senior-level World Championships (i.e., competition labeled “World Championships”), excluding “World Junior Championships” and other age-category events. Case-insensitive matching was applied to account for casing differences in stored values.
