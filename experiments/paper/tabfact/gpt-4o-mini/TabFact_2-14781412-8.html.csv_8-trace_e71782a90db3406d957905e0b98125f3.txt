Claim to verify: “the gold medalist for equestrian at the asian game have be different in every year they have occur except 1994 and 1998.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Table: public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games (columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Full table review to see all gold medalists by year
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (abridged to golds by year):
  - 1982: Nadia Al-Moutawaa
  - 1986: Takashi Tomura
  - 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara
  - 1998: Jin Kanno
  - 2002: Mikaela María Jaworski
  - 2006: Ali Yousuf Al-Rumaihi
  - 2010: Ramzy Al Duhami

2) Direct check for 1994 and 1998 gold medalists
- SQL: SELECT year, gold FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE year IN (1994, 1998) ORDER BY year;
- Result:
  - 1994: Konoshin Kuwahara
  - 1998: Jin Kanno
- Observation: 1994 and 1998 have different gold medalists.

3) Check if any gold medalist repeats across all available years
- SQL (total rows): SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
  - Result: 7
- SQL (distinct golds): SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT gold) AS distinct_gold_medals FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games;
  - Result: 7
- Interpretation: Number of distinct gold medalist names equals the total number of rows; thus, no gold medalist appears more than once in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The data show that every listed year has a different gold medalist, including 1994 and 1998. Therefore, the specific exception claimed (that 1994 and 1998 had the same gold medalist) is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions and scope
- Interpreted “equestrian at the Asian Games” as represented by the table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games and its “gold” column (the gold medalist for the equestrian event recorded per listed year).
- Verification is within the scope of the years present in the dataset (1982, 1986, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010), which we treat as authoritative for this task.
