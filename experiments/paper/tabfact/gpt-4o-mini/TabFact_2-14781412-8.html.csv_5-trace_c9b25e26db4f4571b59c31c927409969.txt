Conclusion: The claim is not supported. Equestrian at the Asian Games did not occur strictly every 4 years from 1982 to 2010; the year 1990 is missing in the authoritative dataset.

Data source explored:
- Database: public schema
- Table: equestrian_at_the_asian_games (columns: year, location, gold, silver, bronze)

Evidence retrieved (executed SQL and results):
1) SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;

Result (ordered by year):
- 1982 | New Delhi | Nadia Al - Moutawaa | Jamila Al - Moutawaa | Bariaa Salem Al - Sabbah
- 1986 | Seoul | Takashi Tomura | Shuichi Toki | Ryuzo Okuno
- 1994 | Hiroshima | Konoshin Kuwahara | Ryuzo Okuno | Natya Chantrasmi
- 1998 | Bangkok | Jin Kanno | Sohn Bong - Gak | Quzier Ambak Fathil
- 2002 | Busan | Mikaela María Jaworski | Lee Jin - Kyung | Tadayoshi Hayashi
- 2006 | Doha | Ali Yousuf Al - Rumaihi | Jasmine Chen - Shao Man | Joo Jung - Hyun
- 2010 | Guangzhou | Ramzy Al Duhami | Latifa Al Maktom | Khaled Al - Eid

Analysis:
- A strict 4-year cadence from 1982 to 2010 would include the years: 1982, 1986, 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2006, 2010.
- The dataset shows no record for 1990. There is an 8-year gap between 1986 and 1994, contradicting the claim that equestrian at the Asian Games happened every 4 years across that span.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “happen every 4 year from 1982 to 2010” to mean equestrian events at the Asian Games were held in every edition at 4-year intervals inclusive of both endpoints (1982 and 2010).
