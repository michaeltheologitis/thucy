Claim to verify: "NY Ranger be the visitor to Vancouver on February 24."

Interpretation: Within the available data (1992–93 Vancouver Canucks season), check whether the New York Rangers were the visiting team when Vancouver played on February 24 (during that season, i.e., February 24, 1993).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema with a single table t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season containing game dates, home/visitor teams, scores, and attendance for the Vancouver Canucks’ 1992–93 season.

Evidence 1: Inspect first 10 rows to see date format and February 24 entry.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows (columns reordered by the tool for display):
- Attendance: 16150 | Date: february 24 | Decision: whitmore | Home: vancouver | Record: 34 - 19 - 8 | Score: 4 - 5 | Visitor: ny rangers

Evidence 2: Targeted lookup for the February 24 game with Vancouver as home.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, home, visitor, score, attendance 
FROM public.t_1992_93_vancouver_canucks_season 
WHERE home ILIKE 'vancouver' 
AND date ILIKE '%february 24%';
Result:
- Date: February 24; Home Team: Vancouver; Visitor Team: NY Rangers; Score: 4 - 5; Attendance: 16,150

Conclusion: The data for the 1992–93 season confirms that on February 24 (1993), Vancouver hosted the NY Rangers; thus, the NY Rangers were the visiting team in Vancouver on that date.

Assumptions:
- “NY Ranger” refers to the NHL team “New York Rangers.”
- “Vancouver” refers to the Vancouver Canucks (home team in the dataset).
- The unspecified year is interpreted as February 24, 1993, the only February 24 present in the available 1992–93 season dataset.
