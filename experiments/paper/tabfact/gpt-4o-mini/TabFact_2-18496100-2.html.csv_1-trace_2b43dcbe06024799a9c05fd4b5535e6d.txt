Claim: “Mehgaon has the highest number of electorate in 2009.”

Data source overview
- Database: public schema
- Table: bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
- Relevant columns: name (text), number of electorates (2009) (bigint)

Key checks and evidence
1) Identify and handle any aggregate/total rows
- Purpose: Determine if the table contains an aggregate “total” row that should be excluded from constituency-level comparisons.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "number of electorates (2009)" = (SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency) OR name LIKE '%total%';
- Result:
  name = total :; number of electorates (2009) = 1371252

- Executed SQL (count of rows with the overall max):
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE "number of electorates (2009)" = (SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency);
- Result: count = 1

Interpretation: The table includes a non-constituency aggregate row named “total :”. For verifying the claim among constituencies, this row must be excluded.

2) Find the constituency with the maximum electorate in 2009 (excluding totals)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" 
  FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
  WHERE name NOT ILIKE 'total%'
  ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC 
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: name = mehgaon; number of electorates (2009) = 210649

- Executed SQL (check for ties at the maximum):
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
  WHERE "number of electorates (2009)" = 
    (SELECT MAX("number of electorates (2009)") 
     FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency 
     WHERE name NOT ILIKE 'total%');
- Result: count = 1

Interpretation: Mehgaon is the sole constituency with the maximum electorate in 2009 when excluding the aggregate total row.

3) Context: Top 5 constituencies by electorate (2009), excluding totals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)"
  FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
  WHERE name NOT LIKE '%total%'
  ORDER BY "number of electorates (2009)" DESC
  LIMIT 5;
- Results (descending):
  1) Mehgaon — 210649
  2) Lahar — 205839
  3) Bhind — 197183
  4) Ater — 177334
  5) Gohad — 166893

4) Direct lookup for Mehgaon
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('Mehgaon');
- Result: name = mehgaon; number of electorates (2009) = 210649

Conclusion
- The data shows that, among actual constituencies (excluding the aggregate “total :” row), Mehgaon has the highest number of electorates in 2009, with 210,649 electors, and there are no ties at this maximum.

Assumptions
- “Mehgaon” refers to the constituency named “Mehgaon” in the bhind_lok_sabha_constituency table.
- “Highest number of electorate in 2009” is interpreted among constituency rows, excluding the aggregate “total :” row.
- “Electorate” corresponds to the column “number of electorates (2009)”.
