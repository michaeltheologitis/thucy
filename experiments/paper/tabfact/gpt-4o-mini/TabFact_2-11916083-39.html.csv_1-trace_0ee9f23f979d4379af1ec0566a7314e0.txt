Summary
- Objective: Verify whether “D - 10 Locomotive” by artist Dan Fell is from 2002 (interpreting the claim as referring to a Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin entry).

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s containing coin entries from the 2000s.

Schema details
- Table: royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
  - Columns: year (bigint), theme (text), artist (text), mintage (text), issue price (double precision)

Evidence
1) Query to find entries whose theme includes ‘D-10 Locomotive’
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage
FROM royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
WHERE theme ILIKE '%Locomotive%' OR theme ILIKE '%D-10 Locomotive%';
Result excerpt:
- Year: 2002; Theme: D - 10 Locomotive; Artist: Dan Fell; Mintage: included in the gray - dort

2) Query to find entries by artist ‘Dan Fell’ around 2002
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage
FROM royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
WHERE artist = 'Dan Fell' AND year BETWEEN 2000 AND 2002;
Result excerpt:
- Year: 2002; Theme: D - 10 Locomotive; Artist: Dan Fell; Mintage: included in the gray - dort

Assessment
- Both queries independently return an entry with year 2002, theme “D - 10 Locomotive,” and artist “Dan Fell.” This supports the claim that the “D - 10 Locomotive” item by Dan Fell is from 2002.
- Note: The mintage text appears irregular but does not affect verification of the year, theme, and artist.

Conclusion
- The data supports that “D - 10 Locomotive” by artist Dan Fell is from 2002.

Assumptions
- The user’s claim refers to a Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin entry titled (or themed) “D - 10 Locomotive,” and “from 2002” pertains to the coin’s year of issue in the database.
