Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. In the Royal Canadian Mint 2000s dataset, the Bricklin SV-1 coin exists but is not by John Mardon nor part of any “Steam Buggy” mintage grouping. The John Mardon entry with mintage noted as “included in steam buggy” has the theme “The Toronto,” not “Bricklin SV-1.”

Key evidence from the database (public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s):

FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s 
WHERE theme ILIKE '%bricklin%' AND mintage ILIKE '%steam buggy%';

5) Is there any Bricklin coin by John Mardon?

Overall assessment
- The Bricklin SV-1 coin (2003) is designed by Brian Hughes and is noted as “Included in HMCS Bras Dor,” not “Included in steam buggy.”
- The John Mardon item with “included in steam buggy” in the mintage field has the theme “The Toronto,” not “Bricklin SV-1.”
- No intersection exists in this dataset between Bricklin SV-1 and either John Mardon or a “Steam Buggy” mintage inclusion.

Assumptions made due to wording:
- Interpreted “john mardon include in steam buggy mintage” to mean an entry where artist = John Mardon and the mintage field contains the phrase “included in steam buggy.”
- Interpreted “bricklin sv - 1 theme” as the theme field containing “Bricklin SV - 1.” All checks were performed within the available Royal Canadian Mint 2000s dataset, which the tools report as the relevant authoritative source available.
