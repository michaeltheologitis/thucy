Claim to verify: "greg ostertag go to oregon state and play for the jazz from 1988 - 90"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (all-time Utah Jazz roster).
- Schema (from inspection): columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text).

Evidence
1) Identify Greg Ostertag’s Jazz tenure and listed school
- Result: Player: Greg Ostertag; Years for Jazz: 1995 - 2004, 2005 - 06; School / Club Team: Kansas
- Executed SQL: SELECT player, "years for jazz", "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';

Interpretation: The roster lists Kansas (not Oregon State) as his school, and his Jazz seasons begin in 1995, not 1988.

2) Check explicitly for mention of 1988 or 1990 in his Jazz years
- Result: years for jazz = "1995 - 2004 , 2005 - 06"; no mention of 1988 or 1990
- Executed SQL: SELECT "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE 'Greg Ostertag';

Assessment of claim components
- "go to oregon state": Not supported. Data shows "Kansas" as his school; thus the Oregon State claim is contradicted.
- "play for the jazz from 1988 - 90": Not supported. Data shows Jazz years start in 1995, with no 1988–1990 period.

Conclusion
Both central parts of the claim are contradicted by the data: Greg Ostertag’s listed school is Kansas, and his Utah Jazz tenure starts in 1995 (with a return in 2005–06), not 1988–90.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "go to oregon state" as referring to college attended.
- Interpreted "play for the jazz from 1988 - 90" as NBA seasons inclusive with the Utah Jazz.
- Treated the "school / club team" field as the authoritative record of a player’s college in this dataset.
