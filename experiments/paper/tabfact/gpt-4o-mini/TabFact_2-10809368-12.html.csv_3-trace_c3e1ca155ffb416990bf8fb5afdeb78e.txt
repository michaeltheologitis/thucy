Summary
- Claim interpreted: St Kilda were the away team in a match where the home team’s score was exactly 12.11 (83).
- Data scope: The available authoritative dataset covers the 1946 VFL season (table: public.t_1946_vfl_season). Scores are stored as text in the format G.B (PTS).
- Finding: In the 1946 dataset, there are no matches where the home team score equals 12.11 (83). Therefore, St Kilda cannot have been the away team in such a match within this dataset.

Evidence from the database
1) Check for any match with home team score exactly '12.11 (83)'
- Result: 0 rows returned (no such match exists in 1946 data).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '12.11 (83)';

2) Check for any match where the home team totaled 83 points (any goals/behinds combination)
- Result: 0 rows returned.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score"
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" LIKE '%(83)%';

3) Confirm team naming for St Kilda in this dataset
- Result: Team appears as "st kilda" in team fields (case-insensitive search).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%Kilda%'
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT "away team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season WHERE "away team" ILIKE '%Kilda%';

Conclusion
- Since no match exists with a home team score of 12.11 (83) in the 1946 VFL dataset, the claim that St Kilda were the away team in such a match is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the matches represented in the accessible dataset (public.t_1946_vfl_season), i.e., the 1946 VFL season.
- Score matching requires the exact notation '12.11 (83)'.
- Team names are matched as stored ("st kilda").
