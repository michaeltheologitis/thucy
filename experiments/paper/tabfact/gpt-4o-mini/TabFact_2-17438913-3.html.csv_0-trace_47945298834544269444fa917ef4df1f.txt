Scope and data source
- Explored available data sources and found a single PostgreSQL table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season, which contains Rangers FC 2008–09 season transfer records, including player name, destination, transfer window/type, and transfer fee (text).

What the data shows
- Among all rows with a numeric transfer fee, Carlos Cuéllar has the highest recorded fee at 7.8 m, moving to Aston Villa. Other parsed numeric fees in the table are lower (e.g., Daniel Cousin at 3.5 m, Filip Šebo at 1 m). Non-numeric entries like “free” or “undisclosed” were excluded from the max computation.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL)
1) Retrieve players with valid (parsable) transfer fees and compute the maximum
SQL:
SELECT name,
       "transfer fee",
       CASE 
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%undisclosed%' OR "transfer fee" = '' THEN NULL
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%m' THEN (REGEXP_REPLACE("transfer fee", '[^0-9.]+', '', 'g')::numeric) 
           ELSE NULL
       END AS parsed_transfer_fee,
       "moving to",
       type,
       "transfer window"
FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
WHERE CASE 
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%undisclosed%' OR "transfer fee" = '' THEN NULL
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%m' THEN (REGEXP_REPLACE("transfer fee", '[^0-9.]+', '', 'g')::numeric) 
           ELSE NULL
       END IS NOT NULL;

SQL:
SELECT MAX(parsed_transfer_fee) AS max_transfer_fee
FROM (
  SELECT CASE 
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%free%' OR "transfer fee" ILIKE '%undisclosed%' OR "transfer fee" = '' THEN NULL
           WHEN "transfer fee" ILIKE '%m' THEN (REGEXP_REPLACE("transfer fee", '[^0-9.]+', '', 'g')::numeric) 
           ELSE NULL
         END AS parsed_transfer_fee
  FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season
) AS fees;

Result summary (from the above): Maximum parsed transfer fee = 7.8 (millions). Player at this maximum: Carlos Cuéllar; raw fee in table: '7.8 m'; moving to: Aston Villa; window/type: Summer / Transfer.

2) Full ordered list of numeric transfer fees (to confirm the ranking)
SQL:
SELECT name, "transfer fee" AS raw_transfer_fee, 
  CASE
    WHEN "transfer fee" ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' THEN "transfer fee"::numeric
    WHEN "transfer fee" LIKE '%m%' THEN REPLACE("transfer fee", 'm', '')::numeric
    ELSE NULL
  END AS parsed_amount_millions, 
  "moving to", type, "transfer window" 
FROM t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season 
WHERE ("transfer fee" ~ '^[0-9]+(\.[0-9]+)?$' OR "transfer fee" LIKE '%m%')
ORDER BY parsed_amount_millions DESC, name;

Result excerpt:
- Carlos Cuéllar — raw: 7.8 m — parsed: 7.8 — moving to: Aston Villa — type: Transfer — window: Summer
- Daniel Cousin — raw: 3.5 m — parsed: 3.5 — moving to: Hull City — type: Transfer — window: Summer
- Filip Šebo — raw: 1 m — parsed: 1.0 — moving to: Valenciennes — type: Transfer — window: Summer

Conclusion
- Within the available Rangers FC 2008–09 season transfer dataset, Carlos Cuéllar has the highest recorded transfer fee at 7.8 m.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the highest transfer fee among players in the provided Rangers FC 2008–09 season table, not across all clubs or seasons.
- The text '7.8 m' is treated as 7.8 million (unit unspecified in the data).
