Data sources inspected
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
- Columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)

Step 1: Check games with attendance = 38109
Result: One game matches. Kenny Rogers is listed as the winning pitcher; the losing pitcher is Brandon Backe.
- Date: May 20
- Winning Team: Texas
- Score: 7 - 3
- Winning Pitcher: Kenny Rogers
- Losing Pitcher: Brandon Backe
- Attendance: 38109
- Location: Arlington

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", attendance, location 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE attendance = 38109;

Step 2: Check if any game lists Kenny Rogers as the losing pitcher
Result: No rows found where the losing pitcher field contains “Kenny Rogers”.

Executed SQL:
SELECT date, attendance, "winning team", score, "winning pitcher", "losing pitcher", location 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE "losing pitcher" LIKE '%Kenny Rogers%';

Conclusion
- The only game with attendance 38,109 in this dataset credits Kenny Rogers as the winning pitcher, not the losing pitcher. No games in this table list Kenny Rogers as the losing pitcher at any attendance. The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Kenny Rogers” refers to the MLB pitcher (Texas Rangers, 2005), not the musician.
- “Be the losing pitcher” means he was credited with the loss in the official box score.
- Verification is limited to the authoritative dataset available (2005 Texas Rangers season).
