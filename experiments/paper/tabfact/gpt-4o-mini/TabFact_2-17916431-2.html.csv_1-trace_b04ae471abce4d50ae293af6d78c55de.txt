Claim: “5 of the game list end with 0 - 0 result.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season, which contains match data for Bradford City A.F.C. 2008–09.

Schema evidence
- Columns in public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint). No primary key defined.
- Executed SQL to retrieve schema:
  1) SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default 
     FROM information_schema.columns 
     WHERE table_name = 't_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season' 
     AND table_schema = 'public';
  2) SELECT kcu.column_name 
     FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
     JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
     ON kcu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name 
     WHERE tc.table_name = 't_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season' 
     AND tc.table_schema = 'public' 
     AND tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY';

Verification of the claim
- Question answered: How many matches in this table have a final score of 0-0 (including minor format variants like “0-0”, “0 - 0”, or with en/em dashes), and which games are they?

Executed SQL and results
1) Count of 0-0 results:
   SQL:
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0– 0', '0 - 0', '0- 0');
   Result: 5

2) List of games with 0-0 results:
   SQL:
   SELECT date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result IN ('0-0', '0 - 0', '0–0', '0– 0', '0 - 0', '0- 0');
   Result rows:
   - Date: 20 December 2008, Opponent: Chester City, Venue: Home, Result: 0 - 0
   - Date: 26 December 2008, Opponent: Lincoln City, Venue: Away, Result: 0 - 0
   - Date: 3 January 2009, Opponent: Shrewsbury Town, Venue: Home, Result: 0 - 0
   - Date: 17 February 2009, Opponent: Darlington, Venue: Home, Result: 0 - 0
   - Date: 28 March 2009, Opponent: Chester City, Venue: Away, Result: 0 - 0

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 5 matches in the season table ended 0-0. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “game list” refers to all matches recorded in public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season.
- “end with 0 - 0 result” means the result field indicates a nil-nil draw, accounting for minor formatting variations (spacing and dash type).
