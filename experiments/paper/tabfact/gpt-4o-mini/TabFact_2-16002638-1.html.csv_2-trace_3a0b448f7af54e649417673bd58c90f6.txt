- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.dundee_hurricanes
- Columns: season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), final position (text), notes (text)

Evidence 1: Maximum number of ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(ties) AS max_ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
Result:
max_ties = 3

Evidence 2: Season(s) with the maximum number of ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT season FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE ties = 3
Result:
season = 2008

Cross-check: Top seasons by ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes ORDER BY ties DESC, season ASC LIMIT 10;
Result:
2008 | 3
2004 | 1
2009 | 1
2003 | 0
2005 | 0
2006 | 0
2007 | 0

Conclusion
- The data shows the highest number of ties in any season is 3, and the season with that total is 2008. Therefore, the claim is verified by the available data.

Assumptions
- “hurricane” refers specifically to the Dundee Hurricanes represented in the public.dundee_hurricanes table.
- “tie” corresponds to the ties column (number of tied games) and “season” refers to the season year in that table.
