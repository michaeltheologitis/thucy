Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that 0.17 was the highest “swing to gain” value in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election. I verify this against the available dataset’s “swing to gain” field.

Data source inspected
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007
- Relevant columns: rank, constituency, winning party 2003, swing to gain, snp 's place 2003, result

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Check the maximum and minimum “swing to gain” values
SQL: SELECT MAX("swing to gain") AS max_swing, MIN("swing to gain") AS min_swing FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007;
Result: max_swing = 4.91, min_swing = 0.17

2) Identify the constituency at the maximum “swing to gain”
SQL: SELECT "constituency", "winning party 2003", "swing to gain" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE "swing to gain" = (SELECT MAX("swing to gain") FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007);
Result: constituency = Paisley South; winning party 2003 = Labour; swing to gain = 4.91

3) Identify the constituency at the minimum “swing to gain”
SQL: SELECT "constituency", "winning party 2003", "swing to gain" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 WHERE "swing to gain" = (SELECT MIN("swing to gain") FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007);
Result: constituency = Galloway & Upper Nithsdale; winning party 2003 = Conservative; swing to gain = 0.17

4) Top 5 constituencies by highest “swing to gain”
SQL: SELECT constituency, "winning party 2003", "swing to gain" FROM public.scottish_parliament_general_election_2007 ORDER BY "swing to gain" DESC LIMIT 5;
Results:
- Paisley South | Labour | 4.91
- West Renfrewshire | Labour | 4.41
- Linlithgow | Labour | 3.56
- Aberdeen Central | Labour | 2.96
- Glasgow Govan | Labour | 2.92

Conclusion
- The highest “swing to gain” in the dataset is 4.91 (Paisley South), not 0.17.
- The value 0.17 is actually the minimum “swing to gain” (Galloway & Upper Nithsdale).

Assumptions
- “swing to gain” is interpreted as the dataset’s numeric field “swing to gain” for constituencies in the 2007 Scottish Parliament election.
- Values such as 0.17 and 4.91 represent percentage points as stored in the dataset.
