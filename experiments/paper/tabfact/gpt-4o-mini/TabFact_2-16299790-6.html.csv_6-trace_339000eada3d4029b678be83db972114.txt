Claim evaluated: “tiger wood score be less than 205.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf (2002 U.S. Open golf data)

Schema summary for grounding:
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)
- The score column stores a textual breakdown of round scores and a total (e.g., “67 + 68 + 70 = 205”).

Evidence collected from the database:
1) Inspect sample rows to understand score formatting and presence of Tiger Woods
SQL executed:
SELECT place, player, country, score FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf LIMIT 20;
Result excerpt includes:
- Place: 1 | Player: Tiger Woods | Score: 67 + 68 + 70 = 205

2) Locate Tiger Woods’ row explicitly
SQL executed:
SELECT player, place, score, "to par"
FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE '%Tiger%';
Result:
- player: tiger woods | place: 1 | score: 67 + 68 + 70 = 205 | to par: - 5

3) Extract the numeric total and test whether it is less than 205
SQL executed:
SELECT (CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER) < 205) AS is_less_than_205,
       CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER) AS total_strokes
FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf
WHERE player ILIKE 'Tiger Woods';
Result:
- total_strokes: 205 | is_less_than_205: false

Conclusion based on evidence:
- Tiger Woods’ score in this dataset is 205 (not less than 205). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “tiger wood” as “Tiger Woods.”
- Interpreted “score” as the total strokes shown in the score field of this dataset. The format (three component rounds plus total) indicates these are cumulative through the listed rounds; regardless, the recorded total equals 205, not less than 205.
