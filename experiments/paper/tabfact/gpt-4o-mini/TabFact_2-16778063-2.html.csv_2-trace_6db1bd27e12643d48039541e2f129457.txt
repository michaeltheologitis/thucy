Claim interpreted: User appears to ask whether, in Week 14, the Cincinnati Bengals’ opponent was the Cleveland Browns (i.e., “at Cleveland Browns”).

Data sources explored:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season (2001 Cincinnati Bengals season). Columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify the Week 14 opponent
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 14;
Result:
- Week: 14
- Date: December 16, 2001
- Opponent: New York Jets
- Result: L 15 - 14
- Attendance: 77,745

2) Check occurrences vs. Cleveland Browns and corresponding weeks
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance 
FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season 
WHERE opponent = 'cleveland browns' 
ORDER BY week;
Results:
- Week 5 | Oct 14, 2001 | cleveland browns | W 24 - 14 | 64,217
- Week 11 | Nov 25, 2001 | cleveland browns | L 18 - 0 | 72,918

Conclusion:
- In Week 14, the Bengals played the New York Jets, not the Cleveland Browns. Therefore, the claim that the opponent was (at) Cleveland Browns in Week 14 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Due to the available dataset being specifically the 2001 Cincinnati Bengals season, I interpreted the claim as referring to the Bengals’ Week 14 opponent in the 2001 NFL season.
- “At Cleveland Browns” was taken to mean that the Week 14 opponent was the Cleveland Browns (home/away status is not recorded in the available table).
