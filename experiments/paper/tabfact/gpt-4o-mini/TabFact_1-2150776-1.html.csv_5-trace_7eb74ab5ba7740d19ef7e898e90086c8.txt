Summary
- Claim: "In 1997, Jeff Gordon finished 200 laps with an average speed of 139.104 mph."
- Finding: Jeff Gordon completed 200 laps in the 1997 event recorded in the available dataset, but the average speed was 139.828 mph (not 139.104 mph).

Data source discovery
- Available database: pocono_400 (public schema)
- Table: pocono_400 (columns include year, date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, race time, average speed (mph), etc.)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify 1997 entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, "-", "average speed (mph)"
  FROM pocono_400
  WHERE year = 1997;
- Result (excerpt):
  Date: June 8 | Driver: Jeff Gordon | Team: Hendrick Motorsports | Manufacturer: Chevrolet | Laps: 200 | Average Speed (mph): 139.828

2) Confirm Jeff Gordon’s 1997 record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, date, driver, laps, "average speed (mph)"
  FROM pocono_400
  WHERE year = 1997 AND driver ILIKE '%Jeff Gordon%';
- Result:
  Year: 1997 | Date: June 8 | Driver: Jeff Gordon | Laps: 200 | Average Speed (mph): 139.828

Conclusion
- True: Jeff Gordon completed 200 laps in 1997 (the event recorded on June 8).
- Not true as stated: The average speed was 139.828 mph, not 139.104 mph.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the 1997 event represented in the available pocono_400 dataset (which records a 200-lap race in 1997 with Jeff Gordon). No other 1997 races for Jeff Gordon are present in the accessible data.
