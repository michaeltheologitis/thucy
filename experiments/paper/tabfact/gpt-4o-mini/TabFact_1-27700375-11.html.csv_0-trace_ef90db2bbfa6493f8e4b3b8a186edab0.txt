Claim to verify: "Jordan Farmar led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams."

Data discovery and scope
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL table public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season containing game-level logs for the New Jersey Nets during the 2010–11 NBA season.
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).
- The "high assists" column lists the team’s assist leader for each game as a text string (e.g., "jordan farmar (11)").

Evidence
1) Understand the format of the "high assists" field
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "high assists" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
- Result (examples):
  - deron williams (21)
  - deron williams (9)
  - deron williams (7)
  - jordan farmar (11)
  - jordan farmar (9)
  - jordan farmar (7)
  Interpretation: The field embeds the player name and the assist total in parentheses.

2) Count how many games list each player as the team’s assist leader
- Executed SQL (Farmar):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS farmar_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%jordan farmar%';
  Result: farmar_count = 4

- Executed SQL (Williams):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS williams_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE lower("high assists") LIKE '%deron williams%';
  Result: williams_count = 3

- Executed SQL (table size for context):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
  Result: total_count = 7

3) Check for potential multiple leaders listed in one game (ties)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_multiple_leaders FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high assists" LIKE '%,%' OR "high assists" LIKE '%and%';
  Result: 0
- Executed SQL (sample rows if any):
  SELECT * FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high assists" LIKE '%,%' OR "high assists" LIKE '%and%' LIMIT 5;
  Result: None
  Interpretation: In this dataset, each game has a single listed assist leader; no ties are recorded.

Conclusion
- Within the available 2010–11 New Jersey Nets game log data, Jordan Farmar is listed as the team’s assist leader in 4 games, and Deron Williams in 3 games. Therefore, Jordan Farmar led the team in assists in more games than Deron Williams in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope
- Scope: Verification is restricted to the available dataset (2010–11 New Jersey Nets table). No other seasons or teams are considered.
- Definition: "Led the team in assists" is taken directly from the "high assists" field; because no ties are present in the data, no tie-handling adjustment was required.
- Name matching: Counts were based on case-insensitive substring matches of player names within the "high assists" text field.
