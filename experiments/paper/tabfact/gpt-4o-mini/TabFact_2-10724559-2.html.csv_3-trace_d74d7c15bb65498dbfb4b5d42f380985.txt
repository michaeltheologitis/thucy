Conclusion: Verified. In the football_records_in_italy dataset, the player with an all - time rank of 53 has 258 apps.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: football_records_in_italy

Schema details (from schema inspection):
- Columns: rank (bigint), all - time rank (text), name (text), debut year (bigint), current club (text), goals (bigint), apps (bigint)

Evidence query 1:
- Task: Identify the player with all - time rank 53 and return name and apps.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, apps FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE "all - time rank" = '53'
- Result: name = Luca Toni; apps = 258

Evidence query 2 (full row confirmation):
- Task: Retrieve all columns for the row where all - time rank = 53.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE "all - time rank" = '53';
- Result: { all - time rank: 53; name: Luca Toni; debut year: 2000; current club: Verona; goals: 114; apps: 258; rank: 4 }

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “person” as the player in the football_records_in_italy table.
- Interpreted “apps” as appearances, consistent with the column name 'apps'.
- Matched “all - time rank” to the column named exactly "all - time rank" (text) and compared using the string '53'.
