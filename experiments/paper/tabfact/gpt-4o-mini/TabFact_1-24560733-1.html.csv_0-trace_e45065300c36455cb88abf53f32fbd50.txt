Interpretation of the claim:
- I interpret “the wildcat keep the oppose team scoreless in 4 game” to mean: “The Kentucky Wildcats (football) kept their opponents scoreless in four games.” I base this on the only available data source: a table for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team.

Data source discovery:
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema named t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team.

Evidence from the data:
1) Table preview (to understand structure and values)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team LIMIT 5;
Key observed columns include: date, game, opponent, opponents (opponent points), record, result, wildcats points. Sample rows show several games where opponents = 0.

2) Count of games where the opponent scored 0
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE opponents = 0;
Result: 4

3) Details of those shutout games
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, result 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE opponents = 0;
Returned rows (summarized):
- Sept 27: vs Cincinnati — Wildcats 20, Opponent 0 — Result: Win
- Oct 11: vs 9 Georgia — Wildcats 26, Opponent 0 — Result: Win
- Oct 18: vs 10 Vanderbilt — Wildcats 14, Opponent 0 — Result: Win
- Nov 15: vs Evansville — Wildcats 36, Opponent 0 — Result: Win

Conclusion:
- The data shows that the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team held their opponents scoreless in exactly four games. This directly supports the claim as interpreted.

Assumptions made:
- “Wildcat” refers specifically to the Kentucky Wildcats (football) for the 1947 season, because that is the only available and relevant dataset. The claim is evaluated within this context.
