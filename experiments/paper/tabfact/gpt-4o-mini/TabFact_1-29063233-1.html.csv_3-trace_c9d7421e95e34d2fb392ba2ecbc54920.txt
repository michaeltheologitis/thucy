Claim interpreted: "Lucy Watkins only wrote 1 episode of Series 2" refers to the TV show Merlin, Series 2, and counts credited writer entries in the available dataset.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact (Public schema)
- Relevant table: merlin_series_2
- Table schema:
  - no overall (bigint)
  - no for series (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - directed by (text)
  - written by (text)
  - original air date (text)
  - uk viewers (million) (double precision)

Evidence:
1) Count episodes written by Lucy Watkins
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Lucy Watkins%';
Result: 1 episode

2) List episodes written by Lucy Watkins
SQL:
SELECT "no overall", title FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE "written by" ILIKE '%Lucy Watkins%';
Result: no overall = 23, title = Sweet Dreams

3) Distinct writer credits and counts (to cross-check)
SQL:
SELECT "written by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count 
FROM merlin_series_2 
GROUP BY "written by" 
ORDER BY episode_count DESC;
Result (abridged):
- Julian Jones — 3 episodes
- Howard Overman — 3 episodes
- Jake Michie — 3 episodes
- Ben Vanstone — 2 episodes
- Lucy Watkins — 1 episode

Conclusion: The dataset shows Lucy Watkins is credited with exactly one Merlin Series 2 episode (Sweet Dreams). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- "Series 2" refers to Merlin Series 2 as represented by the merlin_series_2 table.
- "Wrote" means credited in the "written by" field (including any potential co-writes).
