Claim to verify:
"2010 - 11 - 17 be the release date of version 1.0 with a category of utilities, a developer of dino game, and a title of msn money"

What I checked and found:
1) Locate relevant data source and structure
- Tables in the database
  Result: A user table exists named public.list_of_zune_applications
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE' AND table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

- Columns in public.list_of_zune_applications
  Result: Columns are title (text), developer (text), category (text), release date (text), version (text)
  Executed SQL (columns):
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'list_of_zune_applications';
  Executed SQL (constraints):
  SELECT a.attname AS column_name, c.conname AS constraint_name, c.contype AS constraint_type 
  FROM pg_constraint c 
  JOIN pg_attribute a ON a.attnum = ANY(c.conkey) 
  JOIN pg_class cl ON cl.oid = c.conrelid 
  WHERE cl.relname = 'list_of_zune_applications';

2) Verify the specific app record for title = "msn money"
- Query for exact (case-insensitive) title match
  Result:
  Title: msn money
  Developer: microsoft
  Category: utilities
  Release Date: 2010 - 07 - 29
  Version: 1.0
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('msn money');

Observations vs. claim:
- Title: msn money → matches claim
- Category: utilities → matches claim
- Version: 1.0 → matches claim
- Release date: 2010 - 07 - 29 → does not match claimed 2010 - 11 - 17
- Developer: microsoft → does not match claimed dino game

3) Additional cross-checks
- Search for any title containing "msn money" to rule out variants
  Result: Only one row found, same as above
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version 
  FROM public.list_of_zune_applications 
  WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%msn money%';

- Check if any app has developer = "dino game"
  Result: No rows found
  Executed SQL:
  (Tool executed a search equivalent to) SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE LOWER(developer) = LOWER('dino game');

- Check what apps have the release date 2010 - 11 - 17
  Result:
  1) Title: chord finder | Developer: microsoft | Category: utilities | Release Date: 2010 - 11 - 17 | Version: 1.0
  2) Title: windows live messenger | Developer: microsoft | Category: social networking | Release Date: 2010 - 11 - 17 | Version: 1.4
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT title, developer, category, "release date", version
  FROM public.list_of_zune_applications
  WHERE "release date" = '2010 - 11 - 17';

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows that the app titled "msn money" is categorized under utilities and has version 1.0, which supports those parts of the claim.
- However, its release date is 2010 - 07 - 29 (not 2010 - 11 - 17), and its developer is microsoft (not dino game). Therefore, key parts of the claim are incorrect.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the application records in the available dataset (public.list_of_zune_applications) and to the app whose title matches "msn money" (case-insensitive).
- Release date values are compared as stored text (the table stores dates as text in the format "YYYY - MM - DD").
