Data source discovery
- Discovered database: TabFact, schema: public, key table: public.football_records_in_italy.

Schema overview
- Table public.football_records_in_italy columns: rank (bigint), all - time rank (text), name (text), debut year (bigint), current club (text), goals (bigint), apps (bigint).

Evidence collected
1) Retrieve Mirko Vučinić’s record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "debut year", "current club", goals, apps 
  FROM public.football_records_in_italy 
  WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('mirko vučinić');
- Result:
  name: Mirko Vučinić; debut year: 2000; current club: Juventus; goals: 95; apps: 298.
- Interpretation: His debut year in this dataset is 2000 (not later than 2008), and he has non-zero goals overall.

2) Check if there exists a row for Mirko Vučinić with debut year > 2008 and goals = 0
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) > 0 AS exists_row
  FROM public.football_records_in_italy
  WHERE name = 'Mirko Vučinić' AND "debut year" > 2008 AND goals = 0;
- Result: exists_row = false (no such row).

3) Check if any row exists for Mirko Vučinić with debut year > 2008 (regardless of goals)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.football_records_in_italy WHERE name = 'Mirko Vučinić' AND "debut year" > 2008) AS result;
- Result: result = false (no such row).

Assessment of the claim
- The claim states: "mirko vučinić didn't score any goal in a debut year later than 2008".
- The dataset shows his debut year is 2000, not later than 2008, and there is no record of him with a later-than-2008 debut year—let alone one with zero goals. Thus, if the claim implies that there exists a debut year later than 2008 in which he scored no goals, it is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “debut year later than 2008” as the 'debut year' field in public.football_records_in_italy being > 2008 for the player.
- Interpreted “didn’t score any goal” as goals = 0 in the same row.
