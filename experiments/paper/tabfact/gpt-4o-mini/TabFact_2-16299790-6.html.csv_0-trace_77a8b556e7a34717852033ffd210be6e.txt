Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database with a table t_2002_u_s_open_golf containing player and country fields.
- Reviewed the table schema to confirm it includes player and country columns suitable for verifying origin.
- Queried the table for Nick Faldo and inspected the country value.

Schema inspection:
- Table: t_2002_u_s_open_golf
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence from data:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE 'Nick Faldo';
- Result:
  Player: Nick Faldo | Country: England

Conclusion:
- The data shows Nick Faldo with country listed as England, supporting the claim that he is from England.

Assumptions:
- “From England” is interpreted as the country associated with the player in the tournament dataset (i.e., nationality/represented country).
