Claim: “the win score of the vernal ladies tournament be 203.”

Evidence gathered from the available database:
- Data source discovery identified a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table: ai_miyazato.
- Table structure (key columns): tournament (text), winning score (text).

Query executed to locate the tournament and its winning score:
SQL:
SELECT "tournament", "winning score" FROM public.ai_miyazato WHERE LOWER("tournament") LIKE '%vernal%';

Result:
- Tournament: Vernal Ladies
- Winning Score: 69 + 64 + 70 = 203

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists the Vernal Ladies tournament and records its winning score as “69 + 64 + 70 = 203,” which confirms a winning total of 203.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “win score” is interpreted as the “winning score” field in the ai_miyazato table.
- “vernal ladies tournament” refers to the tournament named “Vernal Ladies” in the data.
