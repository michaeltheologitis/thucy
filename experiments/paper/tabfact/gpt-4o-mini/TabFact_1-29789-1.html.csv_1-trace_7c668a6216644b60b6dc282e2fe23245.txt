Summary of what was checked
- Claim: “In the UNWTO region of Asia, 57.7 million international tourist arrivals (2012), which is less than in 2011.”
- Interpretation: The data table is country-level with a UNWTO region field. I interpret the claim as referring to a country within the UNWTO region “Asia” that recorded 57.7 million arrivals in 2012, and asserting that this 2012 value was less than its 2011 value.

Data source consulted
- Database: public schema
- Table: tourism
- Key columns: country (text), “unwto region” (text), “international tourist arrivals (2011)” (text), “international tourist arrivals (2012)” (text), “change (2011 to 2012)” (text)

Evidence from the data
1) Find all records with 57.7 million arrivals in 2012
SQL:
SELECT country, "unwto region", "international tourist arrivals (2011)" AS arrivals_2011, "international tourist arrivals (2012)" AS arrivals_2012, "change (2011 to 2012)" AS change_2011_to_2012
FROM public.tourism
WHERE "international tourist arrivals (2012)" = '57.7 million';

Result:
- Country: China | UNWTO Region: Asia | 2011: 57.6 million | 2012: 57.7 million | Change: +0.3%
- Country: Spain | UNWTO Region: Europe | 2011: 56.2 million | 2012: 57.7 million | Change: +2.7%

2) Cross-check by listing all columns for the same 2012 value
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.tourism WHERE "international tourist arrivals (2012)" = '57.7 million';

Result (relevant part shown):
- China | UNWTO Region: Asia | International Tourist Arrivals (2011): 57.6 million | International Tourist Arrivals (2012): 57.7 million | Change (2011 to 2012): +0.3%
- Spain | UNWTO Region: Europe | International Tourist Arrivals (2011): 56.2 million | International Tourist Arrivals (2012): 57.7 million | Change (2011 to 2012): +2.7%

Assessment of the claim
- True: There is a country in the UNWTO region of Asia (China) with 57.7 million international tourist arrivals in 2012.
- False: The statement that this 2012 figure is less than in 2011 is contradicted by the data. For China, 2011 is 57.6 million and 2012 is 57.7 million (i.e., 2012 is slightly higher, +0.3%).

Conclusion
- The claim is partly incorrect: while the 57.7 million (2012) figure in Asia refers to China and is correct, the direction of change is misstated—2012 is not less than 2011 for that record.

Assumptions
- The phrase “in the UNWTO region of Asia” was interpreted as referring to a country in the Asia UNWTO region (China), since the available dataset is country-level and does not provide region-level aggregates.
