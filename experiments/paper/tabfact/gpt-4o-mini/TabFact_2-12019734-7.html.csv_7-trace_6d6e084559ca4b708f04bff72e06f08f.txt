Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “St Louis was the visiting team in the game against New Jersey when the record was 11 - 33 - 12.” I interpret this as a verification that, in the dataset, there exists a game where the home team is New Jersey, the recorded “record” is 11 - 33 - 12, and the visiting team is St Louis.

Data context check (sample):
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM my_info_table LIMIT 10;
Sample returned rows include one relevant to the record in question:
- february 6 | vancouver | 4 - 4 | new jersey | 11 - 33 - 12

Targeted evidence 1 — Identify the game(s) with home = New Jersey and record = 11 - 33 - 12:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(home) = 'new jersey' AND 
      TRIM(REPLACE(record, ' ', '')) = '11-33-12';
Result:
- Date: February 6; Visitor: Vancouver; Home: New Jersey; Score: 4 - 4; Record: 11 - 33 - 12

Targeted evidence 2 — Check specifically if St Louis was the visiting team under those same conditions:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(REPLACE(REPLACE(visitor, '.', ''), ' ', '')) = 'stlouis' AND LOWER(home) = 'new jersey' AND TRIM(REPLACE(record, ' ', '')) = '11-33-12';
Result: No rows returned.

Additional cross-check — Any New Jersey home games with a visiting team name containing “St Louis”:
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE LOWER(home) = 'new jersey' 
AND (LOWER(visitor) LIKE '%st louis%' OR LOWER(visitor) LIKE '%st. louis%');
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion: The only game in the dataset where the home team is New Jersey and the record is 11 - 33 - 12 lists Vancouver—not St Louis—as the visiting team. No entries match St Louis as the visitor under those conditions.

Assumptions:
- “visit team” refers to the visitor column in my_info_table.
- “New Jersey” refers to the home team string “new jersey” (case-insensitive matches used).
- “record be 11 - 33 - 12” refers to the record column value, allowing for normalization of spaces.
