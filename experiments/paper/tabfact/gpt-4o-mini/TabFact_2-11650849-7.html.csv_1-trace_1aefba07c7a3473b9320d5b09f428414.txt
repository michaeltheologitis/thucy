Claim interpreted: “The Chicago Bears have been the loser against the Green Bay Packers more than 10 times.”

Data source explored
- Available database: default Postgres DB
- Schema: public
- Table: bears_packers_rivalry
- Columns: year (bigint), date (text), winner (text), result (text), loser (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)
- Scope: Each row is a Bears vs. Packers game.

Evidence from the data
1) Distinct losers and their counts
SQL executed:
SELECT loser, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry
GROUP BY loser;
Result:
- Green Bay Packers: 15
- Chicago Bears: 5

2) Case-insensitive, trimmed count of Bears losses
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games_lost_by_bears
FROM public.bears_packers_rivalry
WHERE LOWER(TRIM(loser)) = 'chicago bears';
Result: 5

3) Dataset coverage (context)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM bears_packers_rivalry;
Result: 20

SQL executed:
SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_year, MAX(year) AS latest_year FROM bears_packers_rivalry;
Result: earliest_year = 1950, latest_year = 1959

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (1950–1959 Bears–Packers games), the Chicago Bears are recorded as the loser 5 times, which is not more than 10. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data provided.

Assumptions
- The verification is constrained to the connected dataset (bears_packers_rivalry), which covers games from 1950–1959. The conclusion reflects this scope.
