Claim to verify: “2010 - 11 - 17 be the release date with a category of utilities, a developer of dino game, and a title of chord finder.”

Data sources explored
- Available dataset: PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_zune_applications containing columns: title (text), developer (text), category (text), release date (text), version (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify exact app by title
- Result: One matching row found. Title: chord finder; Developer: microsoft; Category: utilities; Release Date: 2010 - 11 - 17; Version: 1.0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('chord finder');

2) Cross-check apps containing ‘chord’ in the title
- Result: chord finder — Developer: microsoft; Category: utilities; Release Date: 2010 - 11 - 17
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date" 
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications 
WHERE LOWER(title) LIKE '%chord%';

3) Check whether any ‘dino’ developer is linked to ‘chord finder’
- Result: Developers containing ‘dino’ are “dino games”, with titles drum machine hd (2010 - 10 - 20) and metronome (2010 - 09 - 09). No ‘chord finder’ entry by a ‘dino’ developer.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, category, "release date" 
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications 
WHERE lower(developer) LIKE '%dino%';

Assessment of each component of the claim
- Title: “chord finder” — Supported.
- Category: utilities — Supported.
- Release date: 2010 - 11 - 17 — Supported.
- Developer: dino game — Contradicted by data (actual developer is microsoft; developers containing ‘dino’ exist as “dino games” for other apps, not for chord finder).

Conclusion
- The claim is mixed: most fields match the database record for “chord finder,” but the developer does not.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Zune applications dataset (public.list_of_zune_applications).
- Treated “2010 - 11 - 17” as the textual date format used in the dataset.
- Treated “dino game” literally; also checked partial match “dino” to ensure no near-miss like “dino games” applied to the same title.
