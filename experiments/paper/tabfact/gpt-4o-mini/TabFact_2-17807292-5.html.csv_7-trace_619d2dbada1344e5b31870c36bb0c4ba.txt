Claim: “JB Holmes from the United States and Henrik Stenson from Sweden tie for third place with +1 to par.”

Summary of findings:
- Nationalities: Correct — J.B. Holmes is listed as United States; Henrik Stenson is listed as Sweden.
- Placement and score to par: Incorrect — Both J.B. Holmes and Henrik Stenson are tied for second (T2) at −1 to par, not tied for third at +1.
- Third place: There is no entry labeled 3rd/T3; the next group after T2 is T4 at +1 (Sergio García, Pádraig Harrington, Charlie Wi).

Evidence from the database:
1) Direct lookup of the two players
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Holmes%' OR player ILIKE '%Stenson%';
- Result (relevant fields):
  • J.B. Holmes — Place: T2; Country: United States; To-par: −1
  • Henrik Stenson — Place: T2; Country: Sweden; To-par: −1

2) Top of the leaderboard to confirm positions around +1
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY place ASC LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt (relevant to claim):
  • Ben Curtis — Place: 1; To-par: −2
  • J.B. Holmes — Place: T2; To-par: −1
  • Henrik Stenson — Place: T2; To-par: −1
  • Sergio García — Place: T4; To-par: +1
  • Pádraig Harrington — Place: T4; To-par: +1
  • Charlie Wi — Place: T4; To-par: +1

3) Confirmation that there is no 3rd/T3 row
- SQL executed:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE place IN ('T3','3');
- Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion:
- True: Holmes is from the United States; Stenson is from Sweden.
- False: They did not tie for third, nor were they at +1 to par. The data shows they tied for second at −1 to par. Players at +1 to par are listed at T4, not T3.

Assumptions:
- The verification is grounded in the available table public.t_2008_pga_championship, treated as the authoritative dataset for this event context.
