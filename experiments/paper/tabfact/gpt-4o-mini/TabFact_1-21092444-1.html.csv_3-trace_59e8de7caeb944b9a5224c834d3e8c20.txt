Claim: "the black knight lose to stanford , 67 - 14"

Finding: Supported by the 1975 Army football game records in the connected database.

Evidence from data
- Source: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema public, table t_1975_army_cadets_football_team
- Relevant row from query results shows:
  - date: oct 4
  - opponent: stanford
  - result: loss
  - black knights points: 14
  - opponents: 67
  - record: 2 - 2 (at that point in the season)
  This matches a 67-14 loss to Stanford.

Executed SQL (producing the evidence)
SELECT date, opponent, result, "black knights points", opponents, record FROM public.t_1975_army_cadets_football_team;

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly lists a game vs Stanford with Army (Black Knights) losing 14-67, which corresponds to “lose to Stanford, 67-14.”

Assumptions
- “black knight” refers to the Army Black Knights (the team is historically also referred to as Army Cadets in older records; the table column uses “black knights points”).
- The claim pertains to the 1975 season reflected in the available dataset.
