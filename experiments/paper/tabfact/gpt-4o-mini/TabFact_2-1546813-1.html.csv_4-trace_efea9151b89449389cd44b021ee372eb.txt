Claim to verify: “the highest score for a winning team be 18 and the lowest score be 11.5.”

Data source discovery
- Connected database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: solheim_cup (columns: year bigint, venue text, winning team text, score text, usa captain text, europe captain text)

Understanding the data
- Sample rows to inspect score formatting and confirm that the first number in score corresponds to the winning team’s points.
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, "winning team", score FROM public.solheim_cup LIMIT 30;
Observed examples (subset of returned rows):
- 2013 | Europe | 18 - 10
- 2011 | Europe | 15 - 13
- 2005 | United States | 15½ - 12½
- 2000 | Europe | 14½ - 11½
- 1996 | United States | 17 - 11
- 1994 | United States | 13 - 7
- 1992 | Europe | 11½ - 6½
- 1990 | United States | 11½ - 4½
These confirm the winning score is the first number and may include the half character ½.

Computation of highest and lowest winning-team scores
- Method: Parse the first numeric value before the dash in score, normalize ‘½’ to ‘.5’, handle possible en-dashes, trim spaces, cast to numeric; then compute MIN and MAX.
Executed SQL:
SELECT
  MAX(CAST(NULLIF(TRIM(SUBSTRING(REPLACE(REPLACE(score, '–', '-'), '½', '.5') FROM '^[^-]+')), '') AS numeric)) AS max_score,
  MIN(CAST(NULLIF(TRIM(SUBSTRING(REPLACE(REPLACE(score, '–', '-'), '½', '.5') FROM '^[^-]+')), '') AS numeric)) AS min_score
FROM
  public.solheim_cup;

Results
- Maximum winning team score: 18
- Minimum winning team score: 11.5

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: highest winning-team score is 18 and lowest is 11.5.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “winning team score” as the first numeric value in the score column (confirmed by samples).
- The claim refers to the Solheim Cup dataset in the connected database.
