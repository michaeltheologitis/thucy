Assessment
- Within the authoritative Dragons’ Den UK dataset accessible here, no entry for a company or product named “Reestore” was found. Therefore, the dataset provides no supporting evidence that a pitch by “Reestore” requested £50,000 or that Deborah Meaden and Theo Paphitis were the investing dragons for such a pitch.
- Because the verification depends strictly on available data, and no corroborating record exists in this dataset, the claim is unsupported by the evidence at hand.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Assumed the company would appear in the dataset under the name “Reestore” (or a close variant) in the column "company or product name." If the company appears under a different spelling or a different product name, it would not be captured by the above queries.
- Treated the connected Dragons’ Den UK dataset as complete and authoritative within its scope, per instructions.
