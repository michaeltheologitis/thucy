Claim: "the game with the lowest attendance happen on 11 february 2006"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season (Manchester United 2005–06 season).
- Table schema (from the database):
  - date (text)
  - opponents (text)
  - h / a (text)
  - result f - a (text)
  - attendance (bigint)
  - league position (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the minimum attendance recorded in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(attendance) AS minimum_attendance FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season;
- Result: 20206

2) Retrieve the match(es) with that minimum attendance
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season);
- Result row:
  - date: 11 February 2006
  - opponents: Portsmouth
  - h / a: a
  - result f - a: 3 - 1
  - attendance: 20206
  - league position: 2nd

(Additional executed SQL from earlier step providing the same evidence):
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponents, attendance, "result f - a" 
  FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season 
  WHERE attendance = (
    SELECT MIN(attendance) 
    FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  );
- Result: date = 11 February 2006, opponents = Portsmouth, attendance = 20206, result f - a = 3 - 1

Conclusion
- The match with the lowest attendance in this dataset occurred on 11 February 2006. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Manchester United 2005–06 season as represented by the available table. Other seasons or teams are out of scope for this verification.
