Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the 1st leg score for the year 2004 was 4 - 1 (within the available dataset context).

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database contains table: public.copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty.
- Table schema columns: year, winner, runners - up, aggregate, 1st leg, 2nd leg.

Evidence:
- Retrieved the 2004 entry from the copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty table.
- Result for 2004:
  - 1st leg: 0 - 2
  - 2nd leg: 4 - 1
  - Aggregate: 4 - 3
  - Winner: San José de los Arroyos
  - Runners-Up: Durazno

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT year, "1st leg", "2nd leg", aggregate, winner, "runners - up" FROM copa_san_isidro_de_curuguaty WHERE year = 2004;
