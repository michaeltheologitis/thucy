Summary of approach
- I explored the available data sources, identified a Season 4 dataset for “So You Think You Can Dance,” and queried it to verify which choreographer(s) are associated with the style “jazz.”

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database: public
- Table: so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 (columns: couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results)

Step 1: Confirm that “jazz” is a style in the dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT style FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4;
Result excerpt: jazz (among others)

Step 2: Find choreographer(s) for style = 'jazz'
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "choreographer (s)" FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 WHERE style = 'jazz';
Result:
- Sonya Tayeh

Step 3: Show all jazz entries to verify details
SQL executed:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results 
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4 
WHERE style = 'jazz';
Result:
- Couple: Courtney Galiano and Mark Kanemura; Music: The Garden - Mirah; Choreographer(s): Sonya Tayeh; Results: Kanemura eliminated

Step 4: Check whether Tyce Diorio appears in the dataset and for which style
SQL executed:
SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer (s)", results
FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
WHERE "choreographer (s)" ILIKE '%tyce%';
Result:
- Couple: katee shean joshua allen; Style: contemporary; Music: all by myself - celine dion; Choreographer(s): tyce diorio; Results: safe

Findings
- For style = 'jazz', the only choreographer listed is Sonya Tayeh.
- Tyce Diorio appears in the dataset, but for a contemporary routine, not jazz.

Conclusion
- The claim that the choreographer(s) for the style jazz are “Tyce Diorio and Sonya Tayeh” is not supported by this dataset. Only Sonya Tayeh is listed for jazz; Tyce Diorio is associated with contemporary here.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available Season 4 dataset. Other seasons or sources may differ, but conclusions here are strictly based on the provided data.
- Style matching uses exact value 'jazz' as stored in the dataset.
