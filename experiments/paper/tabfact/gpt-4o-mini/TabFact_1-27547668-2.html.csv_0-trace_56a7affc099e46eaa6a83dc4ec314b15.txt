What I verified
- Claim: “there be 3 episode that air in january , while only 2 air in february.”
- Scope (based on available data): Episodes in the “Republic of Doyle” dataset (table: list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes), counting rows where the original airdate text contains the month name.

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with a table named list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes containing episode metadata including original air dates.

Schema checked
- Table: list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
- Relevant columns: title (text), original airdate (text)
- Note: original airdate is stored as text; month names like “January”/“February” appear literally in this field.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) January episodes
- Result: 3 rows matched.
- Episodes:
  • Fathers and Sons — January 6, 2010
  • The Return of the Grievous Angel — January 13, 2010
  • Duchess of George — January 20, 2010
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE LOWER("original airdate") LIKE '%january%';
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT title, "original airdate" FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE LOWER("original airdate") LIKE '%january%';

2) February episodes
- Result: 2 rows matched.
- Episodes:
  • hit and rum — february 3 , 2010
  • the one who got away — february 10 , 2010
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE LOWER("original airdate") LIKE '%february%';
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT title, "original airdate" FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes WHERE LOWER("original airdate") LIKE '%february%';

Conclusion
- The data shows 3 episodes with January airdates and 2 episodes with February airdates. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the episodes present in the only available dataset (Republic of Doyle) and is not limited to a specific season beyond what’s represented in the table.
- Month classification is based on the presence of the month name in the original airdate text field (case-insensitive).
