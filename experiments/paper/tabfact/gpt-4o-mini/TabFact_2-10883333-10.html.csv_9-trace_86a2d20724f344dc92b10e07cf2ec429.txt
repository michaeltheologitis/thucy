Claim assessed: “Moorabbin Oval have less crowd than Kardinia Park.”

Data source explored: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL matches) containing venue and crowd (attendance) data.

Evidence collected
1) Distinct venues and match counts (confirms both venues exist in the data)
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY venue;
Result excerpt:
- VFL Park: 1
- Moorabbin Oval: 1
- Junction Oval: 1
- Princes Park: 1
- MCG: 1
- Kardinia Park: 1

2) Full rows (shows the actual attendances for the relevant venues)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Venue: Kardinia Park; Crowd: 13,328; Date: 7 June 1975; Home: Geelong; Away: Melbourne
- Venue: Moorabbin Oval; Crowd: 17,811; Date: 7 June 1975; Home: St Kilda; Away: North Melbourne

3) Average crowd per venue (corroborates the per-venue attendance figures)
SQL:
SELECT venue, AVG(crowd) AS average_crowd FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY venue;
and specifically for the two venues:
SELECT venue, AVG(crowd) AS average_crowd FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE venue IN ('Moorabbin Oval', 'Kardinia Park') GROUP BY venue;
Results:
- Moorabbin Oval: 17,811
- Kardinia Park: 13,328

Analysis
- In the available 1975 VFL data (the matches dated 7 June 1975), the recorded crowd at Moorabbin Oval (17,811) exceeded that at Kardinia Park (13,328). Therefore, within this dataset, Moorabbin Oval did not have less crowd than Kardinia Park; it had more.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data available in the database.

Assumptions and scope
- “Crowd” is interpreted as match attendance.
- The verification is based solely on the accessible dataset (matches dated 7 June 1975 in the 1975 VFL season table). Broader or different time periods are not reflected in this data.
