Claim to verify: “facebook by matchbox be release on 2010 - 12 - 16.”

Summary conclusion: Verified. The database shows a single Zune application titled “facebook” by developer “matchbox” with a release date recorded as “2010 - 12 - 16,” matching the claim.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve any entries with a title containing “facebook”
- SQL executed: SELECT title, developer, "release date" FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE title ILIKE '%facebook%';
- Result: title = facebook; developer = matchbox; release date = 2010 - 12 - 16

2) Confirm exact match on title and developer (case-insensitive)
- SQL executed:
SELECT title, developer, "release date" 
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications 
WHERE lower(title) = 'facebook' 
AND lower(developer) = 'matchbox';
- Result: Title = Facebook; Developer = Matchbox; Release Date = December 16, 2010

3) Ensure uniqueness of the entry
- SQL executed: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE title ILIKE '%facebook%';
- Result: row_count = 1

Assessment
- The application titled “facebook” by developer “matchbox” exists and has a release date formatted as “2010 - 12 - 16,” which corresponds to December 16, 2010. The dataset contains exactly one such entry, directly supporting the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Zune application dataset entry (not to a different medium like a song or an unrelated app store listing).
- Minor differences in capitalization (facebook/Matchbox) and date formatting (2010 - 12 - 16 vs. December 16, 2010) are treated as equivalent representations of the same facts.
