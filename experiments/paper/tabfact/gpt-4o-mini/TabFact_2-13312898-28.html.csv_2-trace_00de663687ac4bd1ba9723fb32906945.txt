Claim interpreted: The question asks whether more players were drafted from USC than from Clemson. Based on the available data source (Indianapolis Colts draft history), I verify this within that scope.

Data source inspected
- Database: public
- Table: indianapolis_colts_draft_history (round bigint, pick bigint, overall bigint, name text, position text, college text)

Sanity checks
- Total rows and distinct colleges
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history;
  Result: 13
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT college) AS distinct_colleges FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history;
  Result: 12

Core evidence
- Draft counts by college (top 50)
  SQL:
  SELECT college, COUNT(*) as count
  FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history
  GROUP BY college
  ORDER BY count DESC
  LIMIT 50;
  Result excerpt (relevant entries):
  - USC: 2
  - Clemson: 1

Conclusion
- Within the Indianapolis Colts draft history dataset, more players were drafted from USC (2) than from Clemson (1).

Assumptions
- Scope: Interpreted the claim within the only accessible dataset (Indianapolis Colts draft history). This may not reflect league-wide draft history.
- College labeling: "USC" in this dataset refers to the University of Southern California. No entries containing "Carolina" were found, suggesting no ambiguity with the University of South Carolina in this table.
- Timeframe: All years present in the provided table are included; no additional seasons outside the dataset are assumed.
