Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. In the available dataset for Will & Grace Season 5, episode number 10 corresponds to series number 101, not 103.0. Series number 103 corresponds to episode 12.

Evidence from data
1) Table structure (to identify relevant columns)
- Executed SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'will_grace_season_5';
- Result (excerpt):
  - series — bigint
  - us viewers (millions) — double precision
  - title — text
  - written by — text
  - original air date — text
  - directed by — text
  - season — text

2) Episode number 10 → its series number and title
- Executed SQL: select series, season, title from public.will_grace_season_5 where season = '10';
- Result:
  - series: 101 | season: 10 | title: the honeymoon 's over

3) Cross-check: What does series number 103 refer to?
- Executed SQL: select season, title from public.will_grace_season_5 where series = 103;
- Result:
  - season: 12 | title: field of queens

Interpretation
- In this dataset, the column named "season" holds the episode number within Season 5 (e.g., 10), and the column "series" holds the overall series episode number. Therefore, episode number 10 maps to series number 101.

Assumptions
- "episode number 10" is interpreted as the row where the "season" column equals '10' (i.e., episode 10 within Season 5).
- "series number" is interpreted as the value in the "series" column (overall series episode number).
