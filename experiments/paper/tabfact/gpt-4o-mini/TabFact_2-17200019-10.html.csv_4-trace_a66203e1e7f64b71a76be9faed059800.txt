Summary of data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table in the public schema: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season, which contains R.S.C. Anderlecht 2008-09 season player goal totals by competition (league, title playoff, super cup) and total.

Schema evidence and SQL
- Columns and types identified:
  - player (text)
  - league (bigint)
  - title playoff (bigint)
  - super cup (bigint)
  - total (bigint)
- SQL executed to retrieve schema:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season';

Evidence queries and results
1) Player-specific totals (Mbark Boussoufa and Matias Suarez)
- Result:
  - Mbark Boussoufa: league=11, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=11
  - Matias Suarez: league=3, title playoff=0, super cup=0, total=3
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, league, "title playoff", "super cup", total 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
  WHERE player ILIKE 'Mbark Boussoufa' OR player ILIKE 'Matias Suarez';

2) Team’s top scorer by total
- Result: Mbark Boussoufa with total=11
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, total 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
  ORDER BY total DESC 
  LIMIT 1;

3) Top 19 scorers ranked by total (descending)
- Result (player – total):
  - mbark boussoufa – 11
  - tom de sutter – 9
  - guillaume gillet – 9
  - marcin wasilewski – 8
  - jonathan legear – 7
  - nicolás frutos – 6
  - thomas chatelle – 4
  - roland juhász – 4
  - stanislav vlček – 4
  - lucas biglia – 3
  - dmitri bulykin – 3
  - jan polák – 3
  - matías suárez – 3
  - jelle van damme – 3
  - oleksandr iakovenko – 2
  - hernán losada – 2
  - víctor bernárdez – 1
  - bart goor – 1
  - nemanja rnić – 1
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, total 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season 
  ORDER BY total DESC 
  LIMIT 19;

4) Counts to confirm roster/scorers
- Result: COUNT(total > 0) = 19; COUNT(all rows) = 19
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) as count_positive FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total > 0;
  SELECT COUNT(*) as count_all FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season;

Assessment of the claim components
- “the top scorer (matias suarez) have 8 fewer goal than mbark boussoufa , who have 11 goal”:
  - Boussoufa total = 11 is supported.
  - Suárez total = 3, which is 8 fewer than 11. The numeric difference is correct.
  - However, Suárez is not the team’s top scorer; Boussoufa is. This directly contradicts the claim’s identification of Suárez as top scorer.
- “though 4 player from belgian first division a be in the top 19 scorer”:
  - Within the available dataset (Anderlecht 2008-09), there are exactly 19 scorers for the team; by definition, all 19 are from the Belgian First Division A team Anderlecht. The statement that only 4 players from Belgian First Division A are in the top 19 is not supported in this context. If this was meant to reference a cross-league or external list, no such dataset is available here to verify it.

Conclusion
- The data confirms Boussoufa scored 11 and that Suárez’s total is 3 (which is 8 fewer than Boussoufa). But the claim incorrectly calls Suárez the top scorer, and the “4 players … in the top 19” part is unsupported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “top scorer” and “top 19 scorer” as referring to the 2008-09 R.S.C. Anderlecht squad because the only available authoritative dataset concerns that team/season.
- Treated the “total” column as total goals across listed competitions (league, title playoff, super cup) for 2008-09.
