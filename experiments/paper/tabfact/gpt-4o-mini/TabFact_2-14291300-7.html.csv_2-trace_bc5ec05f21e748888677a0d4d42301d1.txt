Claim interpreted: The user is asserting or requesting confirmation that the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs at the point totals 63, 66, and 69. I verified this against the available data.

Data discovery and structure
- Evidence: Listing all user tables
  - SQL: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog');
  - Result: public.my_info_table

- Evidence: Columns of public.my_info_table
  - SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'my_info_table';
  - Result columns: game (bigint), march (bigint), opponent (text), score (text), record (text), points (bigint)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify the opponents at point totals 63, 66, and 69
- SQL: SELECT game, march, opponent, score, record, points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE points IN (63, 66, 69) ORDER BY points, game;
- Result rows:
  • Points 63: game 68, march 13, opponent = toronto maple leafs, score 3 - 2, record 25 - 30 - 13
  • Points 66: game 71, march 21, opponent = toronto maple leafs, score 1 - 1, record 26 - 31 - 14
  • Points 66: game 72, march 24, opponent = montreal canadiens, score 3 - 5, record 26 - 32 - 14
  • Points 69: game 75, march 28, opponent = pittsburgh penguins, score 3 - 1, record 27 - 33 - 15

Findings from step 1: At 63 points and 66 points, the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs; at 69 points, the opponent was the Pittsburgh Penguins (not the Maple Leafs).

2) Case-insensitive direct check: rows where the opponent is the Toronto Maple Leafs at those point totals
- SQL: SELECT game, march, opponent, score, record, points FROM public.my_info_table WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'toronto maple leafs' AND points IN (63, 66, 69);
- Result rows:
  • game 68, march 13, opponent Toronto Maple Leafs, points 63
  • game 71, march 21, opponent Toronto Maple Leafs, points 66
- No row for points = 69

Conclusion
- The data supports that the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs at 63 and 66 points, but not at 69 points (where the opponent was the Pittsburgh Penguins). Therefore, the statement that the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs at 63, 66, and 69 points is not fully supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “points” refers to the team’s point total at the time of the game record in public.my_info_table.
- “opponent” denotes the opposing team in each game row. The case-insensitive match was used because the stored value is lowercase for team names.
- The request is interpreted as verifying whether the opponent was the Toronto Maple Leafs at each of the specified point totals (63, 66, 69).
