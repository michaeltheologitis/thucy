Claim to verify: "the toronto blue jays lose 3 consecutive game between the 25th and the 28 may 1991"

Data sources explored
- Discovered an MLB-focused table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season in the TabFact database containing 1991 Blue Jays game logs with columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence retrieved
1) Games spanning May 24–29, 1991
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE date IN ('may 24','may 25','may 26','may 27','may 28','may 29') ORDER BY date;

Results returned:
- May 24 — Opponent: Angels; Score: 3 - 2; Loss: Finley (7 - 2); Record: 25 - 17  [Blue Jays won; losing pitcher is Angels’ Finley]
- May 25 — Opponent: Angels; Score: 5 - 0; Loss: Stottlemyre (5 - 1); Record: 25 - 18  [Blue Jays lost; losing pitcher is Blue Jays’ Stottlemyre]
- May 26 — Opponent: Angels; Score: 6 - 2; Loss: Wells (5 - 4); Record: 25 - 19  [Blue Jays lost; losing pitcher is Blue Jays’ Wells]
- May 28 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 8 - 4; Loss: Acker (1 - 2); Record: 25 - 20  [Blue Jays lost; losing pitcher is Blue Jays’ Acker]
- May 29 — Opponent: Athletics; Score: 8 - 3; Loss: Slusarski (1 - 2); Record: 26 - 20  [Blue Jays won; losing pitcher is Athletics’ Slusarski]

Interpretation
- The Blue Jays lost on May 25, May 26, and May 28. There is no game listed on May 27, meaning those three losses constitute three consecutive games played (loss-loss-loss) within the window from May 25 through May 28, 1991.
- The team records corroborate this sequence: 25-17 (May 24) → 25-18 (May 25 loss) → 25-19 (May 26 loss) → 25-20 (May 28 loss) → 26-20 (May 29 win).

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: the Toronto Blue Jays lost three consecutive games between May 25 and May 28, 1991.

Assumptions
- “Between the 25th and the 28 May 1991” is interpreted as inclusive of those dates.
- “Consecutive game” is interpreted as consecutive games played by the team (not necessarily consecutive calendar days), allowing for an off-day on May 27.
- The “loss” column indicates the losing pitcher of the game; when a Blue Jays pitcher is listed, the Blue Jays lost that game. The “record” column is the Blue Jays’ cumulative W-L after each game, used as corroboration.
