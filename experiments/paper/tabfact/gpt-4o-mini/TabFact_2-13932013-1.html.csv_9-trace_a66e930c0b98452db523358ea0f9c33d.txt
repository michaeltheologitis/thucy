Claim to verify: “Otto Graham has 44 more wins than Brady Quinn.”

Data sources discovered
- A PostgreSQL database with a table public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks that contains starting QB information for the Cleveland Browns, including wins, losses, ties, and winning percentage.

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Retrieve Otto Graham and Brady Quinn rows
SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, wins, losses, ties 
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks 
WHERE quarterback ILIKE '%graham%' OR quarterback ILIKE '%quinn%';
Result returned by the tool:
- Otto Graham — Wins: 57, Losses: 13, Ties: 1
- Brady Quinn — Wins: 3, Losses: 9, Ties: 0

2) Supporting retrieval confirming wins for both QBs
SQL executed:
SELECT "quarterback", "wins", "losses", "ties" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE "quarterback" IN ('graham , otto', 'quinn , brady');
Outcome reported by the tool: 57 wins for Otto Graham and 3 wins for Brady Quinn.

Analysis
- From the table, Otto Graham has 57 wins and Brady Quinn has 3 wins as Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks.
- Difference (Graham minus Quinn) = 57 − 3 = 54 wins.
- The claim asserts a difference of 44 wins, which is not supported by the data; the actual difference is 54 wins.

Conclusion
- The data shows Otto Graham has 54 more wins than Brady Quinn (not 44).

Assumptions and scope notes
- Interpreted “wins” as wins as a starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, consistent with the scope of the table used. This likely reflects only Browns starts (and for Graham, NFL-era Browns records as reflected in the table) and does not include starts/wins for other NFL teams or leagues outside the table’s scope.
