Claim assessed: “2 other player apart from Peter Hart have FA Cup goal.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (1979–80 Huddersfield Town FC player stats) with columns including “fa cup goals”.

Evidence
1) List of all players with at least one FA Cup goal
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "fa cup goals" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" > 0;
Result:
- Peter Hart — 1

2) Count of players with at least one FA Cup goal
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_players FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "fa cup goals" > 0;
Result:
- total_players = 1

Conclusion
- The dataset shows only one player (Peter Hart) scored in the FA Cup in 1979–80. There are no “2 other” players apart from Peter Hart with an FA Cup goal.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the available dataset for the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town FC season.
- “FA Cup goal” means at least one goal recorded in the FA Cup for that season.
