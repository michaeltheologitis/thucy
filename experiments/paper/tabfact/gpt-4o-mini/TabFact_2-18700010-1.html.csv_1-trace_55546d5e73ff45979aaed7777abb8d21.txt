Claim interpreted: “The 2 players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart.” Context inferred from available data: the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season table.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season).
- Schema (key columns): name (text), position (text), "league apps" (text), "league goals" (bigint), "fa cup apps" (bigint), "league cup apps" (text), "total apps" (text), etc. Note: "league apps" stores values like "46" or "39 (1)" (starts and substitute appearances).

Evidence
1) Raw league apps per player
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league apps" FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;

Key returned values (subset shown):
- malcolm brown — 46
- peter hart — 46
- dave sutton — 46
- ian robins — 45
- mick laverick — 45
- brian stanton — 41
- david cowling — 39 (1)
- peter fletcher — 30 (8)
...

2) Compute total league appearances (treating values like "30 (8)" as 30+8)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name,
       "league apps" AS league_apps_raw,
       SUM(CASE WHEN val ~ '^\s*$' THEN 0 ELSE CAST(val AS int) END) AS league_apps_total
FROM (
  SELECT name, "league apps",
         regexp_split_to_table("league apps", '[^0-9]+') AS val
  FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
) x
GROUP BY name, "league apps"
ORDER BY league_apps_total DESC, name;

Relevant results:
- dave sutton — league_apps_raw: 46, league_apps_total: 46
- malcolm brown — league_apps_raw: 46, league_apps_total: 46
- peter hart — league_apps_raw: 46, league_apps_total: 46
- ian robins — 45 → 45
- mick laverick — 45 → 45
- david cowling — 39 (1) → 40
- peter fletcher — 30 (8) → 38
...

Findings
- The maximum league appearances total is 46.
- Three players share this maximum: Dave Sutton, Malcolm Brown, and Peter Hart.
- Therefore, while Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart are indeed among the players with the highest league apps, they are not the only ones; Dave Sutton also has the same highest total.

Conclusion
- The claim that “the 2 players with the highest league apps are Malcolm Brown and Peter Hart” is not fully correct. There are three joint-highest players: Dave Sutton, Malcolm Brown, and Peter Hart.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season dataset identified in the connected data source.
- “League apps” represents total league appearances, interpreted as starts plus substitute appearances when the format is “X (Y)”.
