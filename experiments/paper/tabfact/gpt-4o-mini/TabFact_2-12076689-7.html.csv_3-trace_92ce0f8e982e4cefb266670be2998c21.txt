  SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE opponent = 'tigers';
- Result: 2 games

- Executed SQL (dates and scores):
  SELECT date, score FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE opponent = 'tigers';

  • September 13 — Score: 11 - 3

- Executed SQL (full rows for verification):
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE opponent = 'tigers' ORDER BY date;
