Claim interpreted: “the competition type be a junior championship 2 time.” I interpret this as: in the available dataset, entries whose competition is a Junior Championship occur exactly twice.

Data source overview
- Available database: public schema
- Table: public.luk_melich(year bigint, competition text, venue text, position text, notes text)

Evidence 1: Distinct competitions and their counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS competition_count 
FROM public.luk_melich 
GROUP BY competition;
Result (relevant lines):
- European Junior Championships: 1
- World Junior Championships: 1

Evidence 2: Count of rows where competition contains “Junior”
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as junior_competition_count FROM public.luk_melich WHERE competition ILIKE '%Junior%';
Result:
- junior_competition_count = 2

Evidence 3: The specific rows containing “Junior” in competition
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, competition, venue, position, notes 
FROM public.luk_melich 
WHERE competition ILIKE '%Junior%';
Result rows:
1) Year: 1998; Competition: world junior championships; Venue: annecy, france; Position: 10th; Notes: 61.51 m
2) Year: 1999; Competition: european junior championships; Venue: riga, latvia; Position: 5th; Notes: 64.20 m

Conclusion
The dataset shows exactly two entries where the competition is a Junior Championship (World Junior Championships and European Junior Championships). This supports the claim that the competition type is a junior championship “2 time.”

Assumptions
- “competition type” refers to the competition field text that includes the word “Junior.”
- “2 time” means there are exactly two occurrences in the dataset.
