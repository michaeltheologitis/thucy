Claim to verify: “in the 1981 open championship there be 8 player that tie for 9th and 2 that tie for 3”.

Findings based on the available database (table: t_1981_open_championship):

1) Distinct positions and counts
- SQL:
  SELECT place, COUNT(player) AS player_count
  FROM t_1981_open_championship
  GROUP BY place
  ORDER BY place;
- Result (relevant to the claim):
  • t3: 6 players
  • t9: 8 players

2) Direct counts for ties at 9th and 3rd
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS t9_count FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't9';
- Result: 8

- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS t3_count FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't3';
- Result: 6

3) Players comprising each tie group (for transparency)
- SQL:
  SELECT player FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't9';
- Result (8 players):
  Howard Clark; Ben Crenshaw; David Jagger; Mark James; Greg Norman; Arnold Palmer; Bill Rogers; Sam Torrance

- SQL:
  SELECT player FROM t_1981_open_championship WHERE place = 't3';
- Result (6 players):
  Isao Aoki; David Graham; Tony Jacklin; Johnny Miller; Simon Owen; Hal Sutton (a)

Conclusion:
- The statement “8 players tied for 9th” is supported by the data (t9 count = 8).
- The statement “2 tied for 3rd” is contradicted by the data; there were 6 players tied for 3rd (t3 count = 6).

Assumptions made:
- “Open Championship 1981” refers to the dataset in table t_1981_open_championship.
- Tied places are encoded as the text value 'tN' (e.g., 't3' = tied for 3rd, 't9' = tied for 9th).
