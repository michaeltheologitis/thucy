Scope and data discovery
- Discovered available source: a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.
- Schema (from inspection): columns = driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint). The time / retired field contains either finish times/gaps or retirement reasons.

Evidence 1: All distinct values in time / retired and their frequencies
- Purpose: See overall distribution to identify whether “engine” appears frequently relative to other entries.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "time / retired", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
GROUP BY "time / retired"
ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result summary:
  • "engine" – 4
  • "+ 2 laps" – 4
  • "+ 1 lap" – 4
  • "overheating" – 2
  • "1:47:35.5" – 1
  • "+ 4 laps" – 1
  • "+ 31.4" – 1
  • "+ 1:09.4" – 1
  • "differential" – 1
  • "accident" – 1
  • "suspension" – 1
  • "+ 20.9" – 1
  • "fuel leak" – 1
  • "gearbox" – 1
  • "physical" – 1

Evidence 2: Retirement reasons only (excluding time gaps and finish times)
- Purpose: Determine the most common retirement cause by filtering out entries that represent finish times or gaps (e.g., "+ 1 lap", "+ 31.4", actual finish time strings starting with digits).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "time / retired" AS reason, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE NOT ("time / retired" LIKE '+ %' OR "time / retired" ~ '^[0-9]')
GROUP BY "time / retired"
ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result summary:
  • engine – 4
  • overheating – 2
  • gearbox – 1
  • physical – 1
  • differential – 1
  • suspension – 1
  • accident – 1
  • fuel leak – 1

Conclusion
- Within this dataset (1971 South African Grand Prix), engine-related failures are the most common retirement reason (4 occurrences), more frequent than any other listed cause.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as: “In the available race results data (time / retired), engine trouble is the most common retirement reason.”
- The scope is limited to the single accessible table t_1971_south_african_grand_prix; no broader dataset was available.
- “Affect time” was interpreted as referencing the time / retired column, which mixes finish times/gaps and retirement reasons.
