Objective interpretation: Determine the highest recorded attendance at the American Airlines Center within the available data.

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season games). This dataset is treated as authoritative within its scope.

Schema overview (from the database):
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text), record (text).
- Note: The "location attendance" field contains the venue/location and the attendance number together as text, with attendance as the trailing integer.

Evidence 1: Locate games at American Airlines Center
- Result: 1 game found; the row indicates venue text "american airlines center 20301" (lowercase), implying an attendance of 20,301.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" 
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%American Airlines Center%'
- Returned row (values): game=77, date='April 5', team='Dallas', location attendance='american airlines center 20301'.

Evidence 2: Compute the maximum attendance at American Airlines Center (parse trailing number and take MAX)
- Result: 20,301
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE("location attendance", '.*[ ](\d+)$', '\1') AS INTEGER)) AS max_attendance
FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" LIKE 'american airlines center %';

Conclusion:
- Within the available dataset (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season), the highest recorded attendance at the American Airlines Center is 20,301.

Assumptions:
- The user’s request is interpreted as asking for the highest attendance at the American Airlines Center in the available dataset.
- Results are limited to the Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season data and do not represent all-time or other seasons/events at that venue.
