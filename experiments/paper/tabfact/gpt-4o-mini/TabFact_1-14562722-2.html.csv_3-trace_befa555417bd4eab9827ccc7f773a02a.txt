Claim to verify: "the maximum number disc be 1"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: public.my_info_table

Schema details consulted:
- Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text)
- No primary keys or indexes

Evidence gathered:
1) Maximum value of the discs column
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(discs) AS max_value FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: max_value = 1

2) Row counts for context
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, COUNT(discs) AS non_null_discs FROM public.my_info_table;
Result: total_rows = 5, non_null_discs = 5

Conclusion:
- The maximum value of the discs column is 1. This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "number disc" as the maximum value of the "discs" column in public.my_info_table.
