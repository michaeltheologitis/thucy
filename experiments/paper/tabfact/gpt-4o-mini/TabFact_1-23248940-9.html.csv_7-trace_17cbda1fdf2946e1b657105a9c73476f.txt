Claim interpreted: “The second-most rebounds by a Charlotte Bobcats player in a single game is 20.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single table for the Charlotte Bobcats 2009–2010 season: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season

Schema summary (relevant fields)
- game (bigint)
- date (text)
- team (text)
- score (text)
- "high points" (text)
- "high rebounds" (text) — stores the game’s highest rebounds by any Bobcats player as free text (number and likely player name)
- "high assists" (text)
- "location attendance" (text)
- record (text)

Method
- Extract the leading integer from the "high rebounds" text to obtain the numeric rebound count per game.
- Determine the top two distinct single-game rebound counts for the 2009–10 season.
- Cross-check dates/players for context where available.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Top two distinct single-game rebound counts (numeric) in 2009–10
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE("high rebounds", '\\D', '', 'g') AS INTEGER) AS rebound_count
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rebound_count DESC
LIMIT 2;

Result: [20, 17]
- Highest single-game rebounds: 20
- Second-highest single-game rebounds: 17

2) Additional context returned by query (dates/players) for 2009–10
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT ON (rebounds) rebounds, date
FROM (
    SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING("high rebounds" FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) AS rebounds, date
    FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
    WHERE "high rebounds" IS NOT NULL
) AS subquery
WHERE rebounds IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY rebounds DESC;

Follow-up lookups used:
-- For 17 rebounds
SELECT date
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%(17)%';

-- For 20 rebounds
SELECT date
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE "high rebounds" LIKE '%(20)%';

Returned context (from the executed NL query):
- 20 rebounds on February 10 (Nazr Mohammed)
- 17 rebounds on February 3 (Nazr Mohammed)

Conclusion
- Within the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season, the second-highest single-game rebound total is 17, not 20. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- “Bobcat player” is interpreted as a Charlotte Bobcats player.
- Scope is limited to the available authoritative dataset (the 2009–10 season). The claim might be intended as franchise-all-time, but only the 2009–10 season is available; conclusions are drawn strictly from this dataset.
- The numeric rebound count is the leading integer in the "high rebounds" text field.
