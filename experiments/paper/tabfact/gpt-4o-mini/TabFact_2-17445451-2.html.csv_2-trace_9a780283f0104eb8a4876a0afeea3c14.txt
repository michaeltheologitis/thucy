Summary
- Claim interpreted as: “At UFC 20, every fight ended by Decision (Unanimous).”
- Data sources available: one PostgreSQL table named fabiano_iha with columns res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time.
- Approach: Query all records for UFC 20 in the available dataset to inspect the result method(s).

Data source discovery
- Available database: a PostgreSQL database with a single table public.fabiano_iha.
- Table schema:
  - Columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (bigint), time (text).

Evidence
1) Query to find all fights recorded at UFC 20 in the dataset (case-insensitive match on event):
SQL executed: SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time FROM fabiano_iha WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE LOWER('%UFC 20%');
Result:
- Result: Loss; Opponent: Laverne Clark; Method: TKO (cut); Event: UFC 20; Round: 1; Time: 1:31

Analysis
- The available data shows at least one fight at UFC 20 (Fabiano Iha vs. Laverne Clark) ended by TKO (cut), not by Decision (Unanimous). Therefore, the claim that every fight at UFC 20 ended by Decision (Unanimous) is contradicted by the data we have.
- Note: The connected dataset contains only Fabiano Iha’s fights; it does not list the entire card. While we cannot verify the result of the event’s final (main) bout from this dataset, we can definitively refute the stronger interpretation (“every fight”) because at least one documented fight did not end by unanimous decision.

Assumptions
- Due to the phrasing “eveny,” I interpreted the claim as “every fight at UFC 20 ended by Decision (Unanimous).” If the intended meaning was “the event’s final fight ended by Decision (Unanimous),” the connected dataset does not provide event-wide results; thus, that narrower claim cannot be verified here. The verdict below reflects the “every fight” interpretation consistent with the available data.
