Claim to verify: “Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin and Kathy Whitworth be all captain that win the Solheim Cup 1 time.”

What I checked
- Whether Patty Sheehan, Judy Rankin, and Kathy Whitworth appear in the dataset as USA captains.
- For each, how many Solheim Cup captaincies they had and how many of those resulted in a United States win.

Evidence from the database
1) Distinct USA captains in the dataset
- Result includes: Judy Rankin, Kathy Whitworth, Patty Sheehan (among others)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "usa captain" FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE "usa captain" IS NOT NULL;

2) Event-level records for the three named captains
- Rows found:
  - 1990 | Lake Nona Golf & Country Club, Florida, USA | Winning Team: United States | Score: 11½ - 4½ | USA Captain: Kathy Whitworth
  - 1992 | Dalmahoy Country Club, Scotland | Winning Team: Europe | Score: 11½ - 6½ | USA Captain: Kathy Whitworth
  - 1996 | St Pierre Golf & Country Club, Wales | Winning Team: United States | Score: 17 - 11 | USA Captain: Judy Rankin
  - 1998 | Muirfield Village, Ohio, USA | Winning Team: United States | Score: 16 - 12 | USA Captain: Judy Rankin
  - 2002 | Interlachen Country Club, Minnesota, USA | Winning Team: United States | Score: 15½ - 12½ | USA Captain: Patty Sheehan
  - 2003 | Barsebäck Golf & Country Club, Sweden | Winning Team: Europe | Score: 17½ - 10½ | USA Captain: Patty Sheehan
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, venue, "winning team", score, "usa captain"
  FROM public.solheim_cup
  WHERE "usa captain" ILIKE '%Sheehan%'
     OR "usa captain" ILIKE '%Rankin%'
     OR "usa captain" ILIKE '%Whitworth%'
  ORDER BY year;

3) Aggregated counts of events and wins by captain (for these three)
- Results:
  - Judy Rankin | Winning Team: United States | Events Count: 2
  - Kathy Whitworth | Winning Team: United States | Events Count: 1
  - Kathy Whitworth | Winning Team: Europe | Events Count: 1
  - Patty Sheehan | Winning Team: United States | Events Count: 1
  - Patty Sheehan | Winning Team: Europe | Events Count: 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "usa captain", "winning team", COUNT(*) AS events_count
  FROM public.solheim_cup
  WHERE "usa captain" ILIKE '%Rankin%'
     OR "usa captain" ILIKE '%Whitworth%'
     OR "usa captain" ILIKE '%Sheehan%'
  GROUP BY "usa captain", "winning team"
  ORDER BY "usa captain", "winning team";

Findings
- Patty Sheehan: 2 captaincies (2002, 2003), with 1 United States win (2002) in the dataset.
- Judy Rankin: 2 captaincies (1996, 1998), both United States wins (2 wins total).
- Kathy Whitworth: 2 captaincies (1990, 1992), with 1 United States win (1990) and 1 loss (1992).

Conclusion
- The claim that all three “won the Solheim Cup 1 time” as captains is not supported by the data. Judy Rankin has 2 wins as captain, while Patty Sheehan and Kathy Whitworth each have 1 win.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win the Solheim Cup 1 time” to mean: as USA captain, the number of Solheim Cup events where the “winning team” is “United States” equals 1.
- Interpreted “all” as applying to each named person individually.
- Used “United States” in the "winning team" column as the indicator of a USA captain’s win.
