Summary
- Claim: “錢 and 斤 be the only character that have metric value measure in g.”
- Finding: Not correct. The database shows that 兩 also has a metric value expressed in grams, in addition to 錢 and 斤.

Data source discovery
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.chinese_units_of_measurement (columns: jyutping, character, portuguese, relative value, metric value, imperial value). The column metric value maps units to metric quantities.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve entries for 錢 and 斤
- SQL:
SELECT character, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('錢', '斤')
- Result:
  • 錢 — Relative Value: 1 / 160; Metric Value: 3.779936375 g; Imperial Value: ~2.1333 dr
  • 斤 — Relative Value: 1; Metric Value: 604.78982 g; Imperial Value: ~1.3333 lb

2) List all characters with metric values explicitly in grams (metric value string ends with ' g')
- SQL:
SELECT character, "metric value" FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" LIKE '% g';
- Result:
  • 錢 — 3.779936375 g
  • 兩 — 37.79936375 g
  • 斤 — 604.78982 g

3) Context: units mapped to other metric magnitudes (to show broader coverage)
- SQL:
SELECT character, "metric value" FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE "metric value" ILIKE '%g%' ORDER BY character;
- Result (subset):
  • 兩 — 37.79936375 g
  • 斤 — 604.78982 g
  • 錢 — 3.779936375 g
  • 分 — 377.9936375 mg
  • 厘 — 37.79931 mg
  • 担 / 擔 — 60.478982 kg

Conclusion
- Since 兩 also has a metric value measured in grams, 錢 and 斤 are not the only characters with metric values in grams. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “character” refers to the character column in public.chinese_units_of_measurement.
- “metric value measure in g” is interpreted as entries where the metric value is expressed in grams (string ends with " g").
