Summary conclusion:
- ERP (W): Not the same (W230AV = 10 W; W290AG = 27 W).
- Class: The same (both Class D).
Overall, the claim that both ERP W and class are the same is not supported—only the class matches.

Evidence from the data:
- Data source explored: Database TabFact, schema public, table wyfk with columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (text), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text).

Query and results used to verify:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "erp w", "class"
  FROM wyfk
  WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%Gadsden%' OR "city of license" ILIKE '%Griffin%';

- Returned rows:
  1) Call Sign: W230AV; Frequency (MHz): 93.9 FM; City of License: Gadsden, Alabama; ERP (W): 10; Class: D
  2) Call Sign: W290AG; Frequency (MHz): 105.9 FM; City of License: Griffin, Georgia; ERP (W): 27; Class: D

Assessment:
- ERP comparison: 10 W ≠ 27 W → Not the same.
- Class comparison: D = D → Same.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “erp w” as the ERP in watts field and “class” as the station class field in the wyfk table.
- Interpreted the question as asking whether both parameters (ERP W and class) are identical for W230AV in Gadsden, AL and W290AG in Griffin, GA.
