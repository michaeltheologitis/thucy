Claim to verify: “the yugoslavian national team lose the italy against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4.”

Interpretation: The wording is unclear. I interpret the core factual claim as: “Yugoslavia lost to Romania on aggregate 3–4.” The inclusion of “the italy” appears erroneous or extraneous. I verify the claim against the available match-results data for the Yugoslavia national team.

Data sources consulted
- Database: TabFact, schema: public, table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Romania-related matches
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" 
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Romania%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Rumania%';
- Returned rows:
  • Date: March 30 | City: Belgrade | Opponent: Romania | Results: 2:0 | Type of Game: Balkan Cup
  • Date: August 27 | City: Bucharest, Romania | Opponent: Romania | Results: 1:4 | Type of Game: Balkan Cup
- Analysis: Across these two Balkan Cup matches, Yugoslavia’s goals total 3 (2 + 1) and Romania’s goals total 4 (0 + 4), yielding an aggregate of 3–4 in favor of Romania. This supports the core aggregate claim versus Romania.

2) Italy-related matches
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
  FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE opponent LIKE '%Italy%';
- Result: No rows returned from the available table.
- Analysis: The accessible dataset does not show a connection to Italy within this specific aggregate outcome versus Romania. The mention of “Italy” in the claim is not supported by the data presented.

Conclusion
- The data clearly supports that Yugoslavia lost to Romania on aggregate 3–4 in the Balkan Cup across two legs (2:0 home win; 1:4 away loss). However, “Italy” does not figure into this tie in the accessible data.

Assumptions made
- I assume the user intended to state that Yugoslavia lost to Romania on aggregate 3–4 and that the word “Italy” was included in error, as the database evidence does not link Italy to this aggregate outcome.
