Claim interpreted: The user appears to ask whether episode 13 ("season 13" meaning 13th episode in the season) was directed by William Malone, in the context of the available Freddy's Nightmares episodes dataset.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes

Schema (relevant columns):
- series (bigint)
- season (bigint) [represents the episode’s number within the season]
- title (text)
- director (s) (text)
- writer (s) (text)
- original airdate (text)

Evidence 1: Episodes directed by William Malone
SQL: SELECT series, season, title, "director (s)", "original airdate" FROM list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE LOWER("director (s)") LIKE '%william malone%';
Result (relevant row):
- Series: 35 | Season: 13 | Title: Easy Come, Easy Go | Director(s): William Malone | Original Airdate: January 8, 1990
(Also returned: Series 24 "Heartbreak Hotel" [Season 2], Series 28 "Lucky Stiff" [Season 6])

Evidence 2: Episode where season (episode number in season) equals 13
SQL: SELECT series, season, title, "director (s)", "original airdate" FROM list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes WHERE season = 13;
Result:
- Series: 35 | Season: 13 | Title: Easy Come, Easy Go | Director(s): William Malone | Original Airdate: January 8, 1990

Conclusion: The data shows that episode 13 ("Easy Come, Easy Go") was directed by William Malone. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available evidence.

Assumptions made:
- "season 13" is interpreted as the 13th episode within a season (the table’s season column represents episode number within the season), not the 13th season (the series does not have 13 seasons).
- "be direct" is interpreted as a shorthand/typo for "be directed".
- Context is the Freddy's Nightmares episode dataset, as it is the only available authoritative source in the connected data environment.
