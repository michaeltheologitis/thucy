Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the relevant table structure.
- Queried the dataset for any class containing the term “Eagle.”
- Compared the claim to the retrieved evidence.

Data source discovery
- Available database: Southern Railway locomotives (public schema)
- Relevant table: locomotives_of_the_southern_railway

Table schema (as reported by the schema tool)
- Columns: class (text), wheel arrangement (text), manufacturer (text), year made (text), quantity made (text), quantity preserved (text), year (s) withdrawn (text)
- No primary keys or indexes reported.

Evidence query and results
1) Query to find any class mentioning “Eagle”
Executed SQL:
SELECT class, "quantity made", "quantity preserved"
FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE class ILIKE '%Eagle%';

Result:
- Class: Eagle
- Quantity Made: 3
- Quantity Preserved: 0

Assessment
- The claim: “15 of the eagle class be make but 0 be preserve.”
- Data shows: Eagle class has quantity made = 3 and quantity preserved = 0.
- Therefore, the “made” part (15) is not supported; the “preserved” part (0) is supported.

Conclusion
- The claim is partly inaccurate: preservation count matches (0), but production count is incorrect (should be 3, not 15).

Assumptions
- “eagle class” refers to the “Eagle” entry in the Southern Railway locomotives table.
- Evaluation is confined to the available Southern Railway locomotives dataset.
- Numeric values in quantity fields are interpreted as counts despite being stored as text.
