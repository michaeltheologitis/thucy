Data source discovery:
- Available database: cleveland_international_piano_competition (public schema), containing results of the Cleveland International Piano Competition.

Schema overview:
- Table: cleveland_international_piano_competition
  - Columns: year (bigint), first (text), second (text), third (text), fourth (text)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Identify any year where the second-place finisher’s name includes “Anders” or “Martin,” then inspect the corresponding fourth-place name.

Executed SQL:
SELECT year, second, fourth 
FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition 
WHERE second ILIKE '%Anders%' OR second ILIKE '%Martin%' 
ORDER BY year;

Results returned by the query:
- Year: 1975 | Second: Julian Martin (USA) | Fourth: Roe van Boskirk (USA)
- Year: 1991 | Second: Anders Martinson (USA) | Fourth: Jean - François Bouvery (France)

Findings:
- In 1991, the second-place finisher is “Anders Martinson (USA)” and the fourth-place finisher is “Jean - François Bouvery (France).” This directly matches the claim.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Jean - François Bouvery (France) was fourth when Anders Martinson (USA) was second is supported by the 1991 results in the database.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Cleveland International Piano Competition, consistent with the available data source.
- Matching based on stored strings, acknowledging minor spacing/punctuation variations in the claim vs. the dataset (e.g., hyphen and spacing in “Jean - François”).
