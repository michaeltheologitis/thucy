Claim to verify: “the 1977, 1978 and 1989 season each have less than 26 point, more than 18 game, and exactly 13 loss.”

Step 1: Explore available data sources
- We inspected the public schema to identify relevant tables and columns.
Executed SQL:
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result (relevant portion): A table public.coquitlam_adanacs with columns: games (bigint), losses (bigint), points (bigint), season (text), "team name" (text).

Step 2: Retrieve the seasons 1977, 1978, and 1989
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "team name", games, losses, points 
FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs 
WHERE season IN ('1977','1978','1989') 
ORDER BY season;
Results:
- 1977 | coquitlam adanacs | games=24 | losses=13 | points=22
- 1978 | coquitlam adanacs | games=24 | losses=13 | points=21
- 1989 | coquitlam adanacs | games=24 | losses=13 | points=22

Step 3: Directly verify all conditions in one filter
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs 
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989') 
  AND points < 26 
  AND games > 18 
  AND losses = 13;
Results:
- 1977: games=24, losses=13, points=22
- 1978: games=24, losses=13, points=21
- 1989: games=24, losses=13, points=22

Count check
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs 
WHERE season IN ('1977', '1978', '1989') 
  AND points < 26 
  AND games > 18 
  AND losses = 13;
Result: 3

Conclusion
- For each of the seasons 1977, 1978, and 1989: points are less than 26 (22, 21, 22), games are more than 18 (24), and losses equal exactly 13 (13). The data fully supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “point”, “game”, and “loss” in the claim map to the columns points, games, and losses in public.coquitlam_adanacs.
- The dataset pertains to the Coquitlam Adanacs team; the claim is interpreted against this dataset.
