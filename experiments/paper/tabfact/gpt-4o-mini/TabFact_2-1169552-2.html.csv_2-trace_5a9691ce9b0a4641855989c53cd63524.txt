Claim to verify: “for the class hercules, with wheel arrangement 2 - 4 - 0, the manufacturer be nine elm work.”

Finding: Supported by the Southern Railway locomotive database. The entry for class “hercules” with wheel arrangement “2 - 4 - 0” lists the manufacturer as “Nine Elms Works.” The user’s phrasing (“nine elm work”) differs slightly in spelling/pluralization, but the intended manufacturer matches the data.

Evidence from data (including executed SQL):
1) Locate any entry containing “Hercules” in the class field
- SQL:
SELECT class, "wheel arrangement", manufacturer 
FROM locomotives_of_the_southern_railway 
WHERE class ILIKE '%Hercules%';
- Result excerpt:
  - class: hercules; wheel arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0; manufacturer: nine elms works

2) Confirm exact match on class and normalized wheel arrangement, and return manufacturer
- SQL:
SELECT class, "wheel arrangement", manufacturer 
FROM locomotives_of_the_southern_railway 
WHERE LOWER(class) = 'hercules' 
AND REPLACE(REPLACE("wheel arrangement", ' ', ''), '-', '') = '240';
- Result excerpt:
  - class: hercules; wheel arrangement: 2 - 4 - 0; manufacturer: Nine Elms Works

3) Confirm uniqueness of the matching entry
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM locomotives_of_the_southern_railway
WHERE LOWER(class) = 'hercules'
AND REPLACE("wheel arrangement", ' ', '') = '2-4-0';
- Result: row_count = 1

Conclusion: The database shows that for the class “hercules” with wheel arrangement “2 - 4 - 0,” the manufacturer is Nine Elms Works. This supports the claim, with only minor spelling/pluralization differences from the user’s phrasing.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Southern Railway dataset available and uses Whyte notation for the wheel arrangement (2-4-0).
