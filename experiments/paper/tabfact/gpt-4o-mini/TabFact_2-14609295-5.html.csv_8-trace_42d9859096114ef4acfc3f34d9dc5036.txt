Claim: "in 1980 they finish with a record of 18 - 12 and receive the 11 seed"

Data checked: VCU Rams men's basketball seasons.

Evidence from database:
1) Query: SELECT year, record, seed FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1980;
   Result summary: year = 1980, record = 18 - 12, seed = 12

2) Query: SELECT * FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1980;
   Result details: Year: 1980; Record: 18 - 12; Seed: 12; Region: east; Results: l 72 - 86

Assessment:
- Record: Correct (18 - 12 matches the database).
- Seed: Incorrect (database shows a 12 seed, not 11).

Assumptions:
- "they" refers to the VCU Rams men's basketball team, as this is the available authoritative data source.
