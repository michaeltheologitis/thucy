- Finding: Supported by the data. Felton is listed as the Bobcats’ high assists leader in 4 games (including one co-lead) during the 2009–10 season.

Data source discovery
- Available source: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season (game-by-game log for the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats).

Schema context (from schema inspection)

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count

WHERE LOWER("high assists") LIKE '%felton%';
Result: 4

2) List the games
SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, "high assists"
FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
WHERE LOWER("high assists") LIKE '%felton%'
ORDER BY game;
Results (as returned by the query tool):

Assumptions
- “Lead the team in assist 4 different time” refers to per-game team-high in assists within the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season, not career or across multiple franchises/seasons.
- Co-leading is counted as leading.
