Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. The GEOID 3806741020 corresponds to Joliette Township (Pembina County) with 0.771 square miles of water, not 0.717. Additionally, there are no townships in the dataset with an exact water area of 0.717 square miles.

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Check the record for GEOID 3806741020
Executed SQL:
SELECT township, county, "water (sqmi)", "geo id" 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE "geo id" = 3806741020;
Result:
- Township: Joliette
- County: Pembina
- Water (sqmi): 0.771
- Geo ID: 3806741020

2) Search for any township with exactly 0.717 square miles of water
Executed SQL:
SELECT township, county, "water (sqmi)", "geo id" FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE "water (sqmi)" = 0.717;
Result: No rows returned.

Assessment: Since 3806741020 corresponds to a township with 0.771 sq mi of water, and there is no township with 0.717 sq mi of water in the dataset, the statement that “the geo id for a township with 0.717 square mile of water [is] 3806741020” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as: “The GEOID for a township with 0.717 square miles of water is 3806741020.”
- Verification was performed against the available authoritative dataset: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota.
