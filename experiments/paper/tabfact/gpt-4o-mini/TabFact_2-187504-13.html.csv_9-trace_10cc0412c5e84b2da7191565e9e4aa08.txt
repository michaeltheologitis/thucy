Claim: “the soviet union receive 6 more medal than east germany in the total medal count.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database “TabFact” with a table relevant to the 1988 Winter Olympics.

Schema checked
- Table: t_1988_winter_olympics
  - Columns: rank (bigint), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence collected (executed SQL and results)
1) SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM t_1988_winter_olympics;

Tool-reported results from this table for the relevant nations:
- Soviet Union: Gold 11, Silver 9, Bronze 9, Total 29
- East Germany: Gold 9, Silver 10, Bronze 6, Total 25

Analysis
- Calculated difference in total medals (Soviet Union − East Germany) = 29 − 25 = 4.
- The claim asserts a difference of 6, which does not match the data-supported difference of 4 for the 1988 Winter Olympics.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative dataset for the 1988 Winter Olympics, the Soviet Union did not receive 6 more total medals than East Germany; the difference was 4.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “total medal count” to refer to the 1988 Winter Olympics because the available data source contains that specific medal table.
- Treated “Soviet Union” and “East Germany” as the corresponding entries in the table (commonly denoted as URS and GDR respectively).
