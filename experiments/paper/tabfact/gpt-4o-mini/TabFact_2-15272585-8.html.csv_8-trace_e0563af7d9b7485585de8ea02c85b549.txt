Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table: public.galina_voskoboeva. Columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text).

Step 1: Understand data and date format
Executed SQL:
1) Sample rows
SELECT date, opponent, tournament, outcome, score FROM public.galina_voskoboeva LIMIT 10;

2) Distinct dates
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.galina_voskoboeva ORDER BY date LIMIT 20;

Results (abridged):
- Matches include dates: 28 January 2003; 29 June 2003; 3 October 2003; 8 November 2005; 6 June 2006.
- An example row for 6 June 2006 exists: Opponent = Alice Canepa; Tournament = Cuneo, Italy; Outcome = Winner; Score = 6 - 1 , 6 - 2.

Step 2: Check if Galina Voskoboeva ever played the same opponent more than once
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS match_count
FROM galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY match_count DESC, opponent ASC;

Result:
- Alice Canepa — 1
- Lilia Osterloh — 1
- Matea Mezak — 1
- Oleksandra Kravets — 1
- Roberta Vinci — 1

Interpretation: In this dataset, she has not played any opponent more than once.

Step 3: Verify the exception claimed on 6 June 2006
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, tournament FROM public.galina_voskoboeva WHERE date ILIKE '%6 June 2006%';

SELECT COUNT(*) AS matches_on_date FROM public.galina_voskoboeva WHERE date ILIKE '%6 June 2006%';

Results:
- Row found: 6 June 2006 — Opponent: Alice Canepa — Tournament: Cuneo, Italy.
- Count of matches on 6 June 2006: 1.

Conclusion
- The data shows no opponent was faced more than once.
- On 6 June 2006 there is exactly one match recorded (vs Alice Canepa), not multiple matches against the same opponent. Therefore, there is no “exception” date where she played the same opponent more than once.

Final assessment: The claim that “galina voskoboeva never play the same opponent more than 1 time except in 6 june 2006” is contradicted by the available data: there is no repeated opponent at all, and no special exception on 6 June 2006.

Assumptions made
- The table public.galina_voskoboeva represents the authoritative match records available for this verification task. No external data beyond this table was used.
- Dates are stored as text; matching for 6 June 2006 was done using a case-insensitive pattern (ILIKE) to account for formatting.
