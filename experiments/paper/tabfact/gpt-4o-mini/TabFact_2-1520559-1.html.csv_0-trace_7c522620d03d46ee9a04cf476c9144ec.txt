Summary conclusion
Based on the Women’s British Open database, the record for the lowest winning aggregate (fewest total strokes) does not belong to Annika Sörenstam or Yani Tseng. The lowest winning total is 269 by Karen Stupples (2004). Yani Tseng’s best winning total is 272 (2011), which is among the lowest but not the record. Annika Sörenstam’s winning total is 278 (2003), which is higher than these.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify the lowest winning aggregate and its champion(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, score 
FROM women_s_british_open 
WHERE score = (SELECT MIN(score) FROM women_s_british_open);

Result:
- Year: 2004; Champion: Karen Stupples; Score: 269

2) Annika Sörenstam’s Women’s British Open win(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, score, "to par" 
FROM women_s_british_open 
WHERE champion ILIKE '%Annika%' OR champion ILIKE '%Sorenstam%';

Result:
- Year: 2003; Champion: Annika Sörenstam; Score: 278; To-Par: -10

3) Yani Tseng’s Women’s British Open win(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, score, "to par" 
FROM women_s_british_open 
WHERE champion ILIKE '%Tseng%' OR champion ILIKE '%Yani%';

Results:
- Year: 2011; Champion: Yani Tseng; Score: 272; To-Par: -16
- Year: 2010; Champion: Yani Tseng; Score: 277; To-Par: -11

4) Context: five lowest winning aggregates in tournament history
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, champion, score, "to par"
FROM women_s_british_open
ORDER BY score ASC
LIMIT 5;

Results:
1) 2004 — Karen Stupples — 269 (−19)
2) 2008 — Jiyai Shin — 270 (−18)
3) 2011 — Yani Tseng — 272 (−16)
4) 2005 — Jeong Jang — 272 (−16)
5) 2002 — Karrie Webb — 273 (−15)

Assessment
- The lowest winning total is 269 (Karen Stupples, 2004). Therefore, the statement that Annika Sörenstam and Yani Tseng “win with the lowest number of stroke” is not supported by the data when interpreted as the tournament’s all-time lowest winning aggregate.
- Yani Tseng does have one of the lowest winning totals (272 in 2011), but it is not the lowest. Annika Sörenstam’s winning total (278 in 2003) is higher still.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “lowest number of stroke” as the lowest 72‑hole winning aggregate in the Women’s British Open, because the available database is specifically women_s_british_open and includes champion aggregate scores. If the intent was about single-round records or another event, that would require a different dataset.
