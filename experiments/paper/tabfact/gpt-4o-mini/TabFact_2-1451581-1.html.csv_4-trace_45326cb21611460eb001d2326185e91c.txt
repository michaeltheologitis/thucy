Summary of available data source
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic (world’s busiest airports by cargo traffic)
- Relevant columns: rank (bigint), airport (text), code (iata / icao) (text), total cargo (metric tonnes) (bigint), % change (text)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check whether there are any rows for Shanghai Pudong International Airport with rank > 4
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE 'Shanghai Pudong International Airport' AND rank > 4;
Result: No rows returned.

2) Compute the maximum total cargo (metric tonnes) under the same filter
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX("total cargo (metric tonnes)") FROM public.world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic
WHERE airport ILIKE 'Shanghai Pudong International Airport' AND rank > 4;
Result: null (no matching records)

Conclusion
- There are no records where rank > 4 and airport = Shanghai Pudong International Airport in the available dataset. Therefore, there is no “highest total cargo” value under these conditions, and it cannot be 2,939,157 metric tonnes as claimed. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Airport name match performed case-insensitively using ILIKE and the exact full name “Shanghai Pudong International Airport.”
- The verification relies solely on the provided dataset, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
