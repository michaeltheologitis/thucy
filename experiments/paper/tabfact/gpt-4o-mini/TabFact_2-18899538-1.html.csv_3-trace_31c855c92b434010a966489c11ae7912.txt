Claim interpreted: "the home media center have no os x and window" meaning the media server named "home media center" does not support macOS/OS X nor Windows.

Data source explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers
- Relevant columns: name (text), license (text), "os x" (text), "unix - like" (text), windows (text), "web interface" (text)

Evidence step 1: Confirm the product exists in the table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT name FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers;
Result excerpt includes: home media center (confirming the row exists)

Evidence step 2: Check OS X and Windows support values for that row.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "os x", windows FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name = 'home media center';
Results:
- os x: no
- windows: yes

Assessment:
- The data shows "home media center" does not support OS X (true part of the claim).
- The data shows it does support Windows (contradicts the claim).

Conclusion: The claim is partly correct (about OS X) but incorrect about Windows support.

Assumptions made:
- "window" refers to Microsoft Windows operating system.
- "have no" means "does not support" or "no availability on that OS".
