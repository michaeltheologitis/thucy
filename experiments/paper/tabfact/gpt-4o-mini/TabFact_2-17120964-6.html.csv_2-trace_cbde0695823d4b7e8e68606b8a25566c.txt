Claim interpreted: The opponent in an away game on the 22nd was the Wightlink Raiders.

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: public schema with table t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season (Guildford Flames 2008–09 season).
- Table columns (all text): date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, man of the match.

Evidence collected
1) Identify any games vs. Wightlink Raiders
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, competition FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Wightlink%';
Result: Date = 22nd; Opponent = Wightlink Raiders; Venue = Away; Competition = League / Cup.

2) Confirm string details (case/format) for that row
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, LENGTH(date) AS date_len, venue, LENGTH(venue) AS venue_len, opponent 
FROM t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Wightlink%';
Result: date = 22nd (length 4); venue = away (length 4); opponent = wightlink raiders.

3) Directly verify an away game on the 22nd
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, competition FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE date = '22nd' AND venue ILIKE 'away';
Result: Date = 22nd; Opponent = Wightlink Raiders; Venue = Away; Competition = League / Cup.

Conclusion
- The data shows an away game on the 22nd against the Wightlink Raiders. The claim is supported by the season table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Guildford Flames 2008–09 season (the only available dataset).
- “On the 22nd” refers to the day-of-month value stored as the text "22nd" in the table.
- “Away game” matches venue values case-insensitively (e.g., "away").
