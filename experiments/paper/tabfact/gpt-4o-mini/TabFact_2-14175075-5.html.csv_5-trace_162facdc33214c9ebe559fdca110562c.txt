Claim to verify: “Ames be the site with the earliest date.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date [text], site [text], sport [text], "winning team" [text], series [text])

Method and evidence
1) Identify the single earliest event by chronological date (casting text to timestamp)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, site, date::timestamp AS parsed_date 
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
  ORDER BY parsed_date ASC 
  LIMIT 1;
- Result returned by the data tool:
  Date: September 4, 2007; Site: Cedar Rapids; Parsed Date: 2007-09-04T00:00:00Z

2) Cross-check: list the top 5 earliest events chronologically
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, site, date::timestamp AS parsed_date 
  FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
  ORDER BY parsed_date ASC 
  LIMIT 5;
- Results returned by the data tool (in ascending order):
  1) Date: September 4, 2007; Site: Cedar Rapids; Parsed Date: 2007-09-04T00:00:00Z
  2) Date: September 8, 2007; Site: Des Moines; Parsed Date: 2007-09-08T00:00:00Z
  3) Date: September 9, 2007; Site: Iowa City; Parsed Date: 2007-09-09T00:00:00Z
  4) Date: September 15, 2007; Site: Ames; Parsed Date: 2007-09-15T00:00:00Z
  5) Date: November 10, 2007; Site: Peoria; Parsed Date: 2007-11-10T00:00:00Z

Assessment
- The earliest event in the dataset occurs on 2007-09-04 at Cedar Rapids, not at Ames. Ames appears in the early list (2007-09-15) but is not the earliest.

Note on a misleading approach
- A separate tool run demonstrated that ordering by the raw text date can produce incorrect conclusions, e.g., returning “April 1, 2008 at Ames” when using lexicographic ordering on text:
  Executed (misleading) SQL from the tool:
  SELECT MIN(date) AS earliest_date, site FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series GROUP BY site ORDER BY earliest_date LIMIT 1;
  Because the date column is text, lexicographic ordering does not reflect true chronological order. Chronological verification must use a parsed date (e.g., date::timestamp) as shown in the evidence above.

Conclusion
- Based on chronologically parsed dates, Ames is not the site with the earliest date in the table; Cedar Rapids is.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as: “Is Ames the site of the earliest event date recorded in public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series?”
- Treated date parsing via PostgreSQL’s text::timestamp as a valid way to establish chronological order for the dataset’s date strings.
