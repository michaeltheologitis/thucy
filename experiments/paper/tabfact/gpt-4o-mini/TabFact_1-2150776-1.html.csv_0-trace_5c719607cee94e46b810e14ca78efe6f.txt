Claim interpreted: The user appears to ask whether, on June 16, Jeff Gordon was with (i.e., drove for) Hendrick Motorsports. I verify this against the available race database.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: pocono_400 (columns: year, date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, -, race time, average speed (mph), report)

Evidence from data:
1) Search for any Pocono 400 entries on June 16 and list driver and team.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, date, driver, team FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE date ILIKE '%June 16%';
- Result rows:
  - 1991 | june 16 | darrell waltrip | darwal , inc
  - 1996 | june 16 | jeff gordon | hendrick motorsports

2) Confirm Jeff Gordon’s team affiliations in the Pocono 400 table.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, date, team FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE driver ILIKE 'jeff gordon';
- Result rows:
  - 1996 | June 16 | Hendrick Motorsports
  - 1997 | June 8 | Hendrick Motorsports
  - 2007 | June 10 | Hendrick Motorsports
  - 2011 | June 12 | Hendrick Motorsports

Findings:
- The pocono_400 table shows that on June 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon is listed as the driver, and his team is Hendrick Motorsports. This directly supports the claim that on June 16 (specifically 1996 in this dataset), Jeff Gordon was with Hendrick Motorsports.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “On June 16” is interpreted in the context of the Pocono 400 dataset as the race date listed in the table. The statement is verified for June 16, 1996, which is the relevant occurrence found in the data.
- “Be on Hendrick Motorsports” is interpreted as Jeff Gordon’s listed team affiliation for that race date.
