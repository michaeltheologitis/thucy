Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: northeast_delta_dental_international (year, dates, champion, country, score, tournament location, purse, winner's share)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Check whether Jenny Shin is listed as a champion in the available dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT
    year,
    dates,
    champion,
    country,
    score,
    "tournament location",
    purse,
    "winner's share"
  FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international
  WHERE LOWER(champion) = 'jenny shin';
- Result: 0 rows returned (no record of Jenny Shin as champion in this tournament dataset).

Conclusion
- Within the only authoritative data available (Northeast Delta Dental International tournament history), there is no record of Jenny Shin as a champion, so there is no associated winner’s share for her in this event. Therefore, the claim that “champion Jenny Shin share 14,000 dollars when she win” is not supported by the data available here.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible dataset pertains to the Northeast Delta Dental International golf tournament, I interpreted the claim as referring to this event. I did not have access to data for all other tournaments Jenny Shin may have played elsewhere.
