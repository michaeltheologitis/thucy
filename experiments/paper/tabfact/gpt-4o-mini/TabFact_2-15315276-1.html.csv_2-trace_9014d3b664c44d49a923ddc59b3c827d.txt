Claim to verify: “After 2012 the winner's share is never less than 15000.”

Data source explored
- Database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Table: northeast_delta_dental_international
- Relevant columns: year (bigint), champion (text), purse (bigint), "winner 's share" (bigint)

Evidence
1) Count of rows after 2012
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012;
- Result: 1 row

2) Minimum winner's share after 2012
- SQL: SELECT MIN("winner 's share") AS min_winner_share FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012;
- Result: 15000

3) Any rows after 2012 with winner's share < 15000
- SQL: SELECT year, champion, "winner 's share" FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international WHERE year > 2012 AND "winner 's share" < 15000;
- Result: 0 rows returned (none found)

4) Context: years and winner's share values
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT year, "winner 's share" FROM public.northeast_delta_dental_international ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (year -> winner's share):
  - 2004 -> 9100
  - 2005 -> 9100
  - 2006 -> 9800
  - 2007 -> 10500
  - 2008 -> 11200
  - 2009 -> 12600
  - 2010 -> 15400
  - 2011 -> 14000
  - 2012 -> 15000
  - 2013 -> 15000

Assessment
- For all records with year > 2012 (i.e., 2013 in this dataset), the minimum winner's share is 15000 and there are no entries below 15000. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “After 2012” is interpreted as year > 2012 within the northeast_delta_dental_international table.
- “Winner's share” refers to the column named exactly "winner 's share".
- The dataset covers 2004–2013; no records exist beyond 2013 in the available data.
