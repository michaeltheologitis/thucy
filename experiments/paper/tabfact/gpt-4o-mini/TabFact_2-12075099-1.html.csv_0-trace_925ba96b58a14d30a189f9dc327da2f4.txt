Claim to verify: “Pride be the away team with a result of W 11 - 10 for the game held on June 18.”

What the data shows:
- The 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season table contains a game on “june 18” versus “pride,” played at “alumni stadium (kean university).”
- The “home / away” column for that game is “away,” which indicates the Philadelphia Barrage were the away team. Therefore, the Pride were the home team in that game.
- The result is recorded as “w 11 - 10,” i.e., a 11–10 win for the Philadelphia Barrage.

Conclusion based on data:
- Score/outcome portion of the claim is correct: the game was a 11–10 win (W 11 - 10).
- Team-location portion of the claim is incorrect: the away team was the Philadelphia Barrage, not the Pride. Pride were the home team on June 18.

Supporting evidence with executed SQL:
1) Full table listing (shows the June 18 row explicitly)
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season;
Key row from the result:
- date: june 18 | opponent: pride | home / away: away | field: alumni stadium (kean university) | result: w 11 - 10

2) Filtered query for June 18
SQL: SELECT date, opponent, "home / away" AS home_away, field, result FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%june 18%';
Result interpretation: The opponent was Pride; home_away = away (Barrage away); field = Alumni Stadium (Kean University); result = W 11 - 10.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the June 18 game present in the 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season dataset. The year was not specified by the user, so verification was grounded in the available authoritative data source for 2005.
- “W 11 - 10” is interpreted from the Philadelphia Barrage perspective, as recorded in the dataset.
