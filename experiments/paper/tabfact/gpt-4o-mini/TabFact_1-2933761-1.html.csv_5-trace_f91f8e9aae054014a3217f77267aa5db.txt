Conclusion: The claim is false. In the Cube (1997) dataset, both female characters are listed as dead; only a male character (Kazan) is alive after exiting the cube.

Evidence from data
- Full table inspection
  - SQL: SELECT * FROM cube_film_series;
  - Result (relevant rows):
    - joan leaven | mathematics student | female | ... | nicole de boer | dead
    - dr helen holloway | free clinic doctor | female | ... | nicky guadagni | dead
    - kazan | autistic savant | male | ... | andrew miller | alive after exiting the cube

- Female characters and their outcomes
  - SQL: SELECT name, gender, status FROM cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female';
  - Result:
    - Joan Leaven | female | dead
    - Dr. Helen Holloway | female | dead

- Any character alive after exiting the cube
  - SQL: SELECT name, occupation, gender, status FROM cube_film_series WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
  - Result:
    - Kazan | autistic savant | male | alive after exiting the cube

Assessment
- The claim that “both female leave the cube alive” is contradicted by the data. Both identified female characters (Joan Leaven and Dr. Helen Holloway) are dead, while the only listed survivor is Kazan, who is male.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1997 film Cube and “both female” refers to the two female characters present in the provided dataset for that film.
