Claim to verify:
- "the cdr for the period 1975 - 1980 be 9.0 and the life expectancy be 61.5"

Data discovery and relevant structure:
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.my_info_table
- Key columns: period (text), cdr (double precision), life expectancy total (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Retrieve crude death rate (cdr) and life expectancy total for the period "1975 - 1980".
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT cdr, "life expectancy total" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '1975 - 1980';
   Result (from the database):
   - cdr = 9 (per 1,000 population)
   - life expectancy total = 61.5 (years)

Assessment of the claim:
- Crude death rate for 1975 - 1980: 9.0 — matches the data.
- Life expectancy for 1975 - 1980: 61.5 — matches the data.

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are supported exactly by the data in public.my_info_table for the period 1975 - 1980.

Assumptions made:
- "cdr" refers to crude death rate per 1,000 population.
- "life expectancy" refers to the "life expectancy total" (both sexes at birth) column.
- The period is identified exactly by the text value '1975 - 1980' in the period column.
