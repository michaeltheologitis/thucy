Conclusion: The claim is not correct. The Toronto Blue Jays played the Angels 4 times (not 3) in May of the 1991 season.

Evidence from the data
1) Data source discovery
- Available dataset: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (Toronto Blue Jays 1991 season game log)

2) Inspecting the table (to understand date/opponent formats)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 10;
Observation: The date field uses lowercase month names like "may 1" and opponent names are lowercase (e.g., "rangers", "royals").

3) List all May games vs. Angels
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record, attendance 
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE opponent = 'angels' AND date LIKE 'may %';
Result rows:
- Date: May 24, Opponent: Angels, Score: 3 - 2, Record: 25 - 17, Attendance: 26,408
- Date: May 25, Opponent: Angels, Score: 5 - 0, Record: 25 - 18, Attendance: 36,732
- Date: May 26, Opponent: Angels, Score: 6 - 2, Record: 25 - 19, Attendance: 45,307
- Date: May 31, Opponent: Angels, Score: 5 - 1, Record: 27 - 21, Attendance: 50,252

4) Count of May games vs. Angels
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE opponent = 'angels' AND date LIKE 'may %';
Result: 4

Assessment of the claim
- True: The Blue Jays did play the Angels in May 1991.
- False: The number of games was 4, not 3.

Assumptions
- “Angels” refers to the California Angels, represented as "angels" in the opponent column.
- “May” is identified by date values starting with the text pattern "may ".
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season is a complete game log for the 1991 Blue Jays season.
