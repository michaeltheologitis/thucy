Claim to verify: “athlete visa hongisto from finland be in lane number 9.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: A PostgreSQL source containing a single table: athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres (men’s 200m at the 2008 Summer Olympics).

Schema details (from schema inspection):
- Table athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres
  - lane (bigint)
  - athlete (text)
  - nationality (text)
  - time (text)
  - react (double precision)

Evidence 1: Direct lookup of Visa Hongisto’s lane
- Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, nationality, lane, time, react 
FROM athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres 
WHERE TRIM(LOWER(athlete)) = TRIM(LOWER('Visa Hongisto'));
- Result:
  - Athlete: Visa Hongisto | Nationality: Finland | Lane: 3 | Time: 20.76 | React: 0.124

Evidence 2: Full listing of athletes and lanes (to confirm who is in lane 9)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT athlete, nationality, lane 
FROM athletics_at_the_2008_summer_olympics_men_s_200_metres 
ORDER BY lane ASC;
- Key results (ordered by lane):
  - Lane 2: Thuso Mpuang (South Africa)
  - Lane 3: Visa Hongisto (Finland)
  - Lane 4: Wallace Spearmon (United States)
  - Lane 5: Ramil Guliyev (Azerbaijan)
  - Lane 6: Jaysuma Saidy Ndure (Norway)
  - Lane 7: Rondell Sorillo (Trinidad and Tobago)
  - Lane 8: Paul Hession (Ireland)
  - Lane 9: Marvin Anderson (Jamaica)

Conclusion:
- In the available authoritative dataset for the men’s 200m at the 2008 Summer Olympics, Visa Hongisto (Finland) is in lane 3, not lane 9. Lane 9 is occupied by Marvin Anderson (Jamaica).

Assumptions made:
- The claim is interpreted as referring to lane assignments in the men’s 200m event captured by the available dataset (2008 Summer Olympics). If the intent was a different meet/event, lane assignments could differ, but no other data sources are available here to test that alternative interpretation.
