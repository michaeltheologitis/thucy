Claim interpreted: The person’s name is “yi” when the royal house is “ji” and the state is “cai.”

Evidence gathered from the available database:

1) Table schema confirmation
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc';
- Result summary: The table public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc exists with columns: state (text), type (text), name (text), title (text), royal house (text), from (text).

2) Distinct states in the table (to ensure correct casing/values)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT state FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc;
- Result excerpt: Includes 'cai' (lowercase) among others.

3) Retrieve entries for state = 'cai'
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, title, "royal house", "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'cai';
- Result: name = yi; title = marquis; royal house = ji; from = 837 bc.

4) Exact-match verification for name, state, and royal house
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE name = 'yi' AND state = 'cai' AND "royal house" = 'ji';
- Result: A single entry exists with fields: Name = yi, State = cai, Royal House = ji, Type = sovereign, Title = marquis, From = 837 bc.

Conclusion: The data shows an entry where the state is cai, the royal house is ji, and the name is yi. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the user’s statement as asserting/examining whether there exists a leader recorded with name “yi” given royal house “ji” and state “cai” within the provided dataset for the 820s BC period.
- Matching was done with the table’s actual casing (lowercase values).
