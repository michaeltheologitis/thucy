Claim to verify: "no other game have total rebound smaller than 1048"

Data source and schema explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema public
- Table: public.my_info_table
  - Columns: rank (bigint), player (text), years (text), games (bigint), reb avg (double precision), total rebounds (bigint)
  - Row count: 10
  - SQL used to confirm row count:
    SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
    Result: 10

Interpretation used for verification
- Interpreted "total rebound" as the column "total rebounds" in public.my_info_table.
- Interpreted "game" as an entry in this table (i.e., a player record) since the available dataset is player-level with totals and averages, not individual game box scores.

Evidence and findings
1) Minimum and maximum of total rebounds
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN("total rebounds") AS min_rebounds, MAX("total rebounds") AS max_rebounds FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: min_rebounds = 708, max_rebounds = 1048
- Implication: There exist values smaller than 1048 (as low as 708).

2) Count of rows with total rebounds < 1048
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_below_1048 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "total rebounds" < 1048;
- Result: count_below_1048 = 9
- Implication: Many records have total rebounds smaller than 1048.

3) List of rows with total rebounds < 1048 (up to 10, ascending)
- SQL:
  SELECT "player", "years", "games", "reb avg", "total rebounds" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "total rebounds" < 1048 ORDER BY "total rebounds" ASC LIMIT 10;
- Result (examples from returned rows):
  - jesse young | 1999 - 2003 | 115 games | 6.2 reb avg | 708 total rebounds
  - herb estes | 1973 - 1976 | 80 games | 9.2 reb avg | 734 total rebounds
  - rob rose | 1982 - 1986 | 113 games | 7.1 reb avg | 805 total rebounds
  - jai lewis | 2002 - 2006 | 125 games | 7.2 reb avg | 895 total rebounds
  - andre gaddy | 1977 - 1982 | 98 games | 9.3 reb avg | 916 total rebounds
  - robert dykes | 1987 - 1991 | 122 games | 7.5 reb avg | 925 total rebounds
  - george evans | 1997 - 2001 | 116 games | 8.2 reb avg | 953 total rebounds
  - will thomas | 2004 - 2008 | 131 games | 7.6 reb avg | 993 total rebounds
  - kenny sanders | 1985 - 1989 | 107 games | 9.6 reb avg | 1026 total rebounds

4) Rows with total rebounds exactly equal to 1048
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE "total rebounds" = 1048;
- Result: total_count = 1
- SQL (list):
  SELECT player, years, games, "reb avg", "total rebounds"
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE "total rebounds" = 1048;
- Result: Jim Nowers | 1972 - 1976 | 112 games | 9.4 reb avg | 1048 total rebounds

Conclusion
- The data directly contradicts the claim. There are 9 records with total rebounds smaller than 1048, and the minimum total rebounds in the table is 708. Therefore, it is not true that “no other [entry] has total rebounds smaller than 1048.”

Assumptions
- Treated “game” as a player record in the available dataset (public.my_info_table) because no game-level data exists in the accessible sources.
- Treated “total rebound” as the “total rebounds” column in the table.
