Claim to verify: “the life expectancy in 1995 - 2000 be less than 61.5 and the imr be exactly 27.”

Findings:
- For the period covering 1995–2000, the data shows:
  - Life expectancy (total): 69.3 (not less than 61.5)
  - IMR: 34 (not exactly 27)
- Therefore, both parts of the claim are contradicted by the data.

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Retrieve the 1995–2000 period record and evaluate conditions
SQL:
SELECT period, imr, "life expectancy total", "life expectancy males", "life expectancy females", ("life expectancy total" < 61.5) AS le_under_61_5, (imr = 27) AS imr_eq_27 FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period LIKE '%1995%' AND period LIKE '%2000%' ORDER BY period;
Result:
- Period: 1995 - 2000; IMR: 34; Life Expectancy Total: 69.3; Life Expectancy Males: 65.5; Life Expectancy Females: 73.3; le_under_61_5: false; imr_eq_27: false

2) Count rows that satisfy both conditions in 1995–2000
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period LIKE '%1995%' AND period LIKE '%2000%' AND "life expectancy total" < 61.5 AND imr = 27;
Result: 0 rows

Conclusion: The data directly contradicts the claim for the 1995–2000 period.

Assumptions:
- “Life expectancy” refers to the column "life expectancy total" in public.my_info_table.
- “1995 - 2000” is matched by any period text containing both “1995” and “2000”.
- The table represents a single geography/context (no country field is present).
