Claim interpreted: In the available Republic of Doyle episodes dataset, there is no director who directed more than one episode.

Data sources explored
- Connected database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (columns include: "title", "directed by", "written by", "viewers", "original airdate", "prod code")

Evidence
1) Episode counts by director (all directors)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count 
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes 
GROUP BY "directed by" 
ORDER BY episode_count DESC;
Results (as returned):
- Mike Clattenburg: 2 episodes
- Steve Dimarco: 2 episodes
- Robert Lieberman: 2 episodes
- Jerry Ciccoritti: 1 episode
- Larry McLean: 1 episode
- Phil Earnshaw: 1 episode
- Steve Scaini: 1 episode

2) Total number of rows (episodes) in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows 
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes;
Result: 10

3) Directors with more than one episode
Executed SQL:
SELECT "directed by", COUNT(*) AS episode_count 
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes 
GROUP BY "directed by" 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Results (as returned):
- Steve Dimarco — 2 episodes
- Mike Clattenburg — 2 episodes
- Robert Lieberman — 2 episodes

Conclusion
The dataset shows multiple directors with more than one episode. Therefore, the claim that there is no director who directed more than one episode is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated against the connected TabFact database table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes.
- Director identity is taken from the "directed by" text field using exact string matching.
