Claim to verify: “the methyl red reading for Proteus mirabilis be positive.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data source: public schema containing table: imvic (IMViC test results).
- Schema (imvic): columns = species (text), indole (text), methyl red (text), voges - proskauer (text), citrate (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) SQL executed:
SELECT species, indole, "methyl red", "voges - proskauer", citrate FROM imvic;
Key returned rows (relevant excerpt):
- species = proteus mirabilis; indole = negative; methyl red = positive; voges - proskauer = negative; citrate = positive.

2) SQL executed:
SELECT species, indole, "methyl red", "voges - proskauer", citrate FROM public.imvic WHERE species ILIKE '%Proteus%';
Relevant row in result set:
- species = proteus mirabilis; methyl red = positive.

Conclusion
- The database explicitly lists methyl red = positive for proteus mirabilis. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Methyl red reading” refers to the Methyl Red (MR) test result in the IMViC panel.
- Species matching is case-insensitive; the database stores species names in lowercase (e.g., “proteus mirabilis”).
