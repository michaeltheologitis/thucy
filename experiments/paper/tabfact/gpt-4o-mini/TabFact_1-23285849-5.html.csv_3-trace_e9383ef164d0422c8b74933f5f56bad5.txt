Claim interpreted: “Denver” refers to the Denver Nuggets. We verify whether, during November of the 2009–2010 NBA season (the scope of the available dataset), they never lost more than one game in a row.

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season

Step 2 — Inspect table structure
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season' 
  AND table_schema = 'public';
- Result columns:
  - game (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - team (text)
  - score (text)
  - high points (text)
  - high rebounds (text)
  - high assists (text)
  - location attendance (text)
  - record (text)

Step 3 — Extract all November games with W/L result
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, team, LEFT(score, 1) AS result
  FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
  WHERE date ILIKE 'November%'
  ORDER BY game;
- Result (ordered by game):
  - 3 | November 1 | Grizzlies    | W
  - 4 | November 3 | Pacers       | W
  - 5 | November 4 | Nets         | W
  - 7 | November 7 | Hawks        | L
  - 8 | November 10 | Bulls       | W
  - 9 | November 11 | Bucks       | L
  - 10 | November 13 | Lakers      | W
  - 11 | November 17 | Raptors     | W
  - 12 | November 20 | Clippers    | L
  - 13 | November 21 | Bulls       | W
  - 14 | November 24 | Nets        | W
  - 15 | November 25 | Timberwolves| W
  - 16 | November 27 | Knicks      | W

Analysis
- The November sequence of results is: W, W, W, L, W, L, W, W, L, W, W, W, W.
- There are isolated single losses on Nov 7 (Hawks), Nov 11 (Bucks), and Nov 20 (Clippers), each preceded and/or followed by wins.
- No instance of two consecutive losses (L followed by L) occurs in November.
- Therefore, the maximum consecutive losses in November is 1.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: Denver did not lose more than one game in a row during November (for the 2009–2010 season represented in the available dataset).

Assumptions
- “Denver” refers to the Denver Nuggets (NBA), as that is the only Denver-related team represented in the accessible dataset.
- “During November” refers to November 2009 within the 2009–2010 season.
- Win/loss is determined by the first character of the score field (W/L).
