Claim: “larisa latyna have 7 more medal than carl osburn.” Interpreted as: Larisa Latynina has 7 more Olympic medals than Carl Osburn.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists (columns: "medal count" bigint, "date" text, "athlete" text, "nation" text, "sport" text, "record medal event" text)

Step 1 — Confirm athletes and context (sample rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT athlete, "medal count" FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists ORDER BY "medal count" DESC LIMIT 50;
Evidence excerpt from results included both athletes:
- larisa latynina … 18 (also earlier increments 17, 16, ...)
- carl osburn … 11 (also earlier increments 10, 9, 8)

Step 2 — Retrieve maximum medal counts per athlete
SQL executed:
1) For Larisa Latynina
SELECT MAX("medal count") AS larisa_max
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE LOWER("athlete") = 'larisa latynina';
Result: 18

2) For Carl Osburn
SELECT MAX("medal count") AS carl_max
FROM public.list_of_multiple_olympic_medalists
WHERE LOWER("athlete") = 'carl osburn';
Result: 11

Analysis
- Difference = 18 (Larisa Latynina) − 11 (Carl Osburn) = 7
- This matches the claim that Larisa Latynina has 7 more medals than Carl Osburn.

Conclusion
- The data directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “larisa latyna” refers to Larisa Latynina (Soviet gymnast). Spelling normalized to the athlete name present in the dataset.
- “medal” refers to total Olympic medals, represented by the maximum recorded “medal count” per athlete in the table.
