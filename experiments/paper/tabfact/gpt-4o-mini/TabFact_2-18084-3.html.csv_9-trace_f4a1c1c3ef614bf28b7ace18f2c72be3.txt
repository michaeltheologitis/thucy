Claim: “Dwight Phillips [was] the first person to set a long jump record.”

Finding: The data show earlier long jump marks by other athletes decades before Dwight Phillips. He is not the first person to set a long jump record in this dataset.

Key evidence from the database:
1) Sample of records (shows multiple historic marks predating Phillips):
- Evidence rows include Mike Powell (1991), Bob Beamon (1968), Carl Lewis (1991), and Dwight Phillips (2009).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.long_jump LIMIT 10;

2) Earliest entry in the dataset (identifies who appears first historically):
- Result: Bob Beamon — October 18, 1968 — 8.90 m — Mexico City — wind 2.0
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY') AS entry_date, mark, venue, wind 
  FROM public.long_jump 
  ORDER BY entry_date ASC 
  LIMIT 1;

3) Additional ordering check (earliest 10 by date):
- Earliest entries by date include: Bob Beamon (1968), Robert Emmiyan (1987), Larry Myricks (1988), Mike Powell (1991), Carl Lewis (1991) … Dwight Phillips (2009) appears later.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT athlete, TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY') AS entry_date, mark, venue 
  FROM public.long_jump 
  ORDER BY entry_date 
  LIMIT 10;

Conclusion: Dwight Phillips is not the first person in the dataset to have set a top long jump mark; earlier notable marks include Bob Beamon (1968) and Mike Powell (1991), among others. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “first person to set a long jump record” as the earliest recorded top long jump performance present in the available long_jump dataset. The dataset clearly includes historical marks predating Dwight Phillips.
