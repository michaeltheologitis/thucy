Summary conclusion: In the available Utah Jazz all-time roster data, players from Georgia and Penn State collectively cover three distinct positions (guard, forward, center), but they share only one position in common (forward), not two. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source discovered:
- Public PostgreSQL database with table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns include: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify relevant schools and counts
SQL:
SELECT "school / club team", COUNT(player) AS player_count
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster
WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%'
GROUP BY "school / club team";
Result:
- Georgia: 1 player
- Penn State: 1 player

2) Retrieve players and positions for those schools
SQL:
SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE "school / club team" ILIKE '%Georgia%' OR "school / club team" ILIKE '%Penn State%';
Result:
- John Amaechi — Position: Center / Forward — School: Penn State
- Shandon Anderson — Position: Guard / Forward — School: Georgia

Analysis based on evidence:
- Unique positions represented across both schools: {Guard, Forward, Center} = 3 distinct positions.
- Overlap (same positions contributed by both schools): {Forward} = 1 shared position.
- The claim that Georgia and Penn State contribute 2 of the same positions (out of the 3 different positions) is contradicted by the data; they share only one position (Forward).

Conclusion: The data shows 3 distinct positions collectively, but only 1 shared between the two schools, not 2.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguous phrasing):
- "Georgia" refers to the University of Georgia; "Penn State" refers to Pennsylvania State University.
- "Position" refers to the player position(s) listed in the utah_jazz_all_time_roster table.
- The phrase "of the 3 different position" is interpreted as the total number of distinct positions represented by players from these two schools in the dataset.
