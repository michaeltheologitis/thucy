Claim to verify: "there be no home team that score more than 11"

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1938_vfl_season
  - Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Notes on score format
- The field home team score uses Australian rules football notation: goals.behinds (total points). Example: 11.23 (89) means 11 goals, 23 behinds, totaling 89 points (inside parentheses).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of matches (rows)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
- Result: 6

2) Count of matches where the home team’s total points (number inside parentheses) are greater than 11
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count
  FROM t_1938_vfl_season
  WHERE CAST(split_part(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', 1) AS INTEGER) > 11;
- Result: 6
- Interpretation: In all 6 matches, the home team scored more than 11 points.

3) All rows with extracted home total points
- SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", CAST(split_part(split_part("home team score", '(', 2), ')', 1) AS INTEGER) AS home_total_points
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
- Returned rows (home team | home team score | home_total_points):
  - Geelong | 11.23 (89) | 89
  - Fitzroy | 16.12 (108) | 108
  - St Kilda | 14.12 (96) | 96
  - Richmond | 15.14 (104) | 104
  - Footscray | 13.9 (87) | 87
  - North Melbourne | 11.5 (71) | 71
- Interpretation: Every home team scored far more than 11 total points.

4) Alternative interpretation check: home team goals > 11 (the number before the dot)
- SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season 
  WHERE CAST(split_part("home team score", '.', 1) AS INTEGER) > 11;
- Result: 4
- SQL (list those matches):
  SELECT "home team", CAST(split_part("home team score", '.', 1) AS INTEGER) AS home_goals 
  FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season 
  WHERE CAST(split_part("home team score", '.', 1) AS INTEGER) > 11;
- Result rows:
  - Fitzroy | 16
  - St Kilda | 14
  - Richmond | 15
  - Footscray | 13
- Interpretation: Even if “score” meant goals, there are multiple home teams with more than 11 goals.

Conclusion
- Under the natural interpretation (total points), the data shows all home teams scored more than 11 points in this dataset. The claim “there be no home team that score more than 11” is contradicted by the evidence.
- Even under the alternative interpretation (goals), there are several matches where the home team scored more than 11 goals, also contradicting the claim.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to total match points for the home team, represented by the number inside parentheses in the home team score field. As a robustness check, I also evaluated the alternative meaning of “score” as goals (the number before the dot).
- Verification is within the available dataset (public.t_1938_vfl_season), which covers matches from the 1938 VFL season.
