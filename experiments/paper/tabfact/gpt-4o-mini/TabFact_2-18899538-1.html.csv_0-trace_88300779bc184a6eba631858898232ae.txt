Claim interpreted: "the home media center have no o x" is taken to mean: The product/row named "home media center" has no OS X support.

Data source overview:
- Database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table: comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers
- Relevant columns: name, os x, unix - like, windows, web interface

Evidence:
1) Locate entries with names containing Home/Media Center
- Result subset (name, os x):
  - home media center — no
  - jriver media center — no
  - myihome — yes
  - xbmc media center — yes
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "os x" AS os FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name ILIKE '%Home%' OR name ILIKE '%Media Center%';

2) Retrieve OS support details for the specific row "home media center"
- Result:
  - name: home media center
  - os x: no
  - unix - like: no
  - windows: yes
  - web interface: yes
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "os x", "unix - like", windows, "web interface" FROM comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE name = 'home media center';

Conclusion:
- The row "home media center" explicitly lists os x = no. Therefore, the claim that the home media center has no OS X support is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "o x" refers to Apple's OS X (macOS) operating system, matching the column named "os x".
- "the home media center" refers to the row named exactly "home media center" in the comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers table.
