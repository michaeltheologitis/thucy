Summary of approach
- Discovered and inspected the available data source(s) to identify relevant tables and fields for verifying panel membership counts in the 5th Seanad.
- Queried the dataset to compute total members by panel and to check whether any party-specific counts match the claimed figures.

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a table named members_of_the_5th_seanad capturing party-wise counts of members across the 5th Seanad’s panel categories (e.g., agricultural, labour), universities, and Taoiseach nominations.

Schema details consulted
- Table: members_of_the_5th_seanad (public schema)
  - Columns (all NOT NULL unless noted):
    - party (text)
    - administrative panel (bigint)
    - agricultural panel (bigint)
    - cultural and educational panel (bigint)
    - industrial and commercial panel (bigint)
    - labour panel (bigint)
    - national university of ireland (bigint)
    - university of dublin (bigint)
    - nominated by the taoiseach (bigint)
    - total (bigint)
  - Interpretation: Each row is a party; numeric columns are the number of that party’s members in each category.

Evidence 1: Total members by Agricultural Panel and Labour Panel
- Question: What are the total numbers of members elected from the Agricultural Panel and the Labour Panel in the 5th Seanad?
- Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM("agricultural panel") AS total_agricultural_panel, SUM("labour panel") AS total_labour_panel
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
- Result:
  - Agricultural Panel total members: 21
  - Labour Panel total members: 17

Evidence 2: Party-level checks for the specific counts (2 for agricultural; 5 for labour)
- Question: Which parties (if any) have agricultural panel = 2 and/or labour panel = 5?
- Executed SQL:
SELECT party, "agricultural panel", "labour panel", 
CASE 
    WHEN "agricultural panel" = 2 AND "labour panel" = 5 THEN 'Yes'
    ELSE 'No'
END AS both_conditions_met
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE "agricultural panel" = 2 OR "labour panel" = 5;
- Results:
  - Labour Party: agricultural panel = 0; labour panel = 5; both conditions met = No
  - Clann na Talmhan: agricultural panel = 2; labour panel = 1; both conditions met = No

Analysis
- If the claim refers to the total number of members returned via each panel in the 5th Seanad, the data contradicts it: Agricultural Panel totals 21 (not 2), and Labour Panel totals 17 (not 5).
- If the claim was intended as party-specific counts, there are parties that match each number separately (Clann na Talmhan has 2 from the Agricultural Panel; the Labour Party has 5 from the Labour Panel), but not a single party matching both 2 and 5 simultaneously.

Conclusion
- As a statement about overall panel membership counts in the 5th Seanad, the claim is inaccurate. The correct totals are 21 (Agricultural Panel) and 17 (Labour Panel).
- As a party-specific statement, parts of the numbers appear for different parties, but not together for one party.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the agricultural panel have 2 member and the labour panel have 5 member” as referring to total panel counts within the 5th Seanad unless otherwise specified.
- Mapped “agricultural panel” and “labour panel” directly to the columns with the same names in the members_of_the_5th_seanad table, summing across parties for overall totals.
