- Schema: public
- Table: t_1961_vfl_season (columns include: home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd, date)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify venues present in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT venue FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season;
Result (abridged to relevant entries):
- Lake Oval
- Glenferrie Oval

2) Count matches per venue (to understand coverage)
SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count 
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season 
GROUP BY venue 
ORDER BY match_count DESC;
Results (abridged to relevant entries):
- Lake Oval: 1 match
- Glenferrie Oval: 1 match

3) Retrieve the recorded crowd figures by venue
SQL:
SELECT venue, crowd FROM t_1961_vfl_season;
Results (full list shown by tool; abridged to relevant entries):
- glenferrie oval | 15000
- lake oval       | 14500

Analysis
- The dataset contains one recorded match for each of Lake Oval and Glenferrie Oval in the 1961 VFL season table.
- The recorded crowd at Glenferrie Oval is 15,000, while at Lake Oval it is 14,500.
- Therefore, within the available data, Lake Oval did not record a higher crowd than Glenferrie Oval.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data: Glenferrie Oval’s recorded crowd (15,000) exceeds Lake Oval’s (14,500) in this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Record a higher crowd participation” is interpreted as comparing the recorded crowd figures available in the provided 1961 VFL dataset (not an all-time venue record or averages across seasons).
