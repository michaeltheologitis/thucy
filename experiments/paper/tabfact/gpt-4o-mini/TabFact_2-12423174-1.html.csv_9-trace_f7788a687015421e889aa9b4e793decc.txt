Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and explored the relevant schema.
- Queried the only available competition data (1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs) for matches involving Canon Yaoundé.
- Assessed whether Canon Yaoundé scored “zero point” (interpreted as zero goals) in the recorded matches.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (columns: team 1, agg, team 2, 1st leg, 2nd leg)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Search for any match entries involving Canon:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Canon%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Canon%';
Result:
- team 1: canon yaoundé; team 2: as solidarité; agg: 9 - 4; 1st leg: 7 - 3; 2nd leg: 2 - 1.

2) Confirm via substring on Yaoundé:
SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", agg, "1st leg", "2nd leg" FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%yaound%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%yaound%';
Result:
- team 1: canon yaoundé; team 2: as solidarité; agg: 9 - 4; 1st leg: 7 - 3; 2nd leg: 2 - 1.

Analysis
- In the only accessible match record involving Canon Yaoundé (1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs), Canon Yaoundé scored 7 goals in the first leg and 2 goals in the second leg. They did not score zero goals against their opponent in these records.
- If “point” is interpreted as match points, this competition was a knockout tie (aggregate score), not a points-based group stage. Nonetheless, the recorded matches show Canon scored multiple goals.

Conclusion
- The available data contradicts the claim that Canon Yaoundé “score zero point against their opponent.” In the recorded tie, Canon scored 9 goals across two legs.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “point” as “goal,” since the available dataset reflects knockout legs and aggregate scores rather than league points.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the matches present in the only accessible dataset (1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs).
