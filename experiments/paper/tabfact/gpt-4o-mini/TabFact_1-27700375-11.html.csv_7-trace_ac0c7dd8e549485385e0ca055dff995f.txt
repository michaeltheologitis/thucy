Claim: “the nets' only win come at the air canada centre.”

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season (columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record)

Evidence collected
1) Check whether any Nets game at Air Canada Centre was a win
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record 
  FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
  WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Air Canada Centre%';
- Result (single matching row):
  - Game: 80 | Date: April 10 | Team: Toronto | Score: L 92 - 99 (OT) | Location Attendance: Air Canada Centre 17755 | Record: 24 - 56
- Interpretation: The only game at Air Canada Centre in this dataset was a loss, not a win.

2) Explicitly count Nets wins at Air Canada Centre
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins_at_acc 
  FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
  WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Air Canada Centre%' AND score ILIKE 'W%';
- Result: wins_at_acc = 0
- Interpretation: The Nets had zero wins at Air Canada Centre in the season data available here.

3) Identify where the (only) win in this dataset occurred
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record 
  FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
  WHERE score ILIKE 'W%'
  ORDER BY game ASC;
- Result:
  - Game: 77 | Date: April 5 | Team: Minnesota | Score: W 107 - 105 (OT) | Location Attendance: Prudential Center 13461 | Record: 24 - 53
- Interpretation: The win present in this dataset occurred at Prudential Center (Nets’ home), not at Air Canada Centre.

Conclusion
- The available data shows no Nets wins at Air Canada Centre and indicates the win in this slice of the season occurred at Prudential Center. Therefore, the claim that “the nets' only win come at the air canada centre” is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “The Nets” refers to the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets, as represented in the available table.
- “Air Canada Centre” is identified through the location attendance field substring matching.
- The table appears to cover the late-season segment reflected by the game numbers shown; conclusions are made strictly within the scope of this authoritative dataset.
