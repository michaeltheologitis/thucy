Claim interpreted: The user asserts that when “Michael Beade” was the highest scorer, the game score was “W 97 - 92 (OT).” Given the Miami Heat 2008–09 season dataset, this likely refers to Michael Beasley. I verify whether the game with score “W 97 - 92 (OT)” had Michael Beasley as the highest scorer.

Data source explored: TabFact database, schema public, table t_2008_09_miami_heat_season (columns: game, date, team, score, high points, high rebounds, high assists, location attendance, record).

Evidence 1: Identify any game with score containing 97 - 92.
- Result: One match; its high points scorer is Dwyane Wade (27).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT score, "high points" FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season WHERE score LIKE '%97 - 92%';
- Returned row excerpt:
  • score: "w 97 - 92 (ot)"; high points: "dwyane wade (27)".

Evidence 2: Retrieve full details of the W 97 - 92 (OT) game to confirm.
- Result: Date: April 3; Opponent (team column): Charlotte; High Points: Dwyane Wade (27); not Michael Beasley.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, team, score, "high points", "high rebounds", "high assists", "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season WHERE LOWER(score) = LOWER('w 97 - 92 (ot)')
- Returned row excerpt:
  • date: "April 3"; team: "Charlotte"; score: "w 97 - 92 (ot)"; high points: "Dwyane Wade (27)".

Evidence 3: Check all games where a player named Michael (i.e., Michael Beasley) was the high points leader.
- Result: One game: April 14, score L 79 - 81 (OT), High Points: Michael Beasley (23). This is not the 97 - 92 (OT) game and was a loss.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score, "high points" 
FROM public.t_2008_09_miami_heat_season 
WHERE LOWER("high points") LIKE '%michael%';
- Returned row excerpt:
  • date: "April 14"; score: "L 79 - 81 (OT)"; high points: "Michael Beasley (23)".

Conclusion: In the only game with score W 97 - 92 (OT) in the 2008–09 Miami Heat dataset, the highest scorer was Dwyane Wade (27), not Michael Beasley. The one game where Michael Beasley was the highest scorer ended L 79 - 81 (OT). Thus, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions: 
- “Michael Beade” is interpreted as a misspelling of Michael Beasley, a Heat player in 2008–09. 
- Verification is constrained to the available data source: the Miami Heat 2008–09 season table.
