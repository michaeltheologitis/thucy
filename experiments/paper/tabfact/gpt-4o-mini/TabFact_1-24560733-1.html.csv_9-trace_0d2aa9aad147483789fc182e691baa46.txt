Claim to verify: “the most the Wildcats outscored an opponent is 26 points.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team (1947 Kentucky Wildcats football season)

Schema summary used
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "wildcats points" (bigint), opponents (bigint), record (text)

Evidence 1: Maximum margin of victory
- Finding: The largest margin of victory was 36 points, against Evansville on November 15, 1947 (score 36–0).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, ("wildcats points" - opponents) AS margin
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
WHERE "wildcats points" - opponents = (SELECT MAX("wildcats points" - opponents)
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team)

Evidence 2: Existence of a 26-point win
- Finding: There was a 26-point win on October 11 vs 9 Georgia (score 26–0), but it was not the largest.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, ("wildcats points" - opponents) AS margin 
FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
WHERE ("wildcats points" - opponents) = 26;

Conclusion
- The data show the largest margin of victory was 36 points, not 26. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “Wildcats” refers to the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team (the only available dataset).
- “Outscore an opponent” is interpreted as margin of victory (team points minus opponent points).
- Conclusions are limited to the 1947 season represented in the available table.
