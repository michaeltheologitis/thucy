Claim interpretation: The user appears to assert that, in the available NGC list, there are exactly two entries classified as spiral galaxies.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single relevant table: list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (NGC objects numbered 5001–6000).
- Schema (key columns):
  - ngc number (bigint)
  - object type (text)
  - constellation (text)
  - right ascension ( j2000 ) (text)
  - declination ( j2000 ) (text)
  - apparent magnitude (double precision)

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count spiral galaxies in the list
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_spiral_galaxies, "object type" AS exact_object_type
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE LOWER("object type") LIKE '%spiral%'
GROUP BY "object type";
- Result (summarized): Total spiral galaxies = 2; breakdown: Spiral Galaxy = 2.

2) List the specific NGC numbers for spiral galaxies
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "object type" ILIKE '%spiral%'
ORDER BY "ngc number";
- Result: NGC 5457 — Spiral Galaxy; NGC 5474 — Spiral Galaxy.

Conclusion
- The table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 contains exactly 2 entries classified as spiral galaxies (NGC 5457 and NGC 5474). This supports the claim that the list has two NGC numbers that are spiral galaxies.

Assumptions
- “the list” refers to the available table list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (NGC numbers 5001–6000).
- “spiral galaxy” is identified by object type values containing the substring “spiral” (case-insensitive).
