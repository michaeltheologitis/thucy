Claim to verify: A UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a score of 1 - 3 was held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra.

Data source inspected: Database TabFact, schema public, table branimir_suba_i (columns: date text, venue text, score text, result text, competition text).

Step 1: Identify UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying matches and check for 1–3 results.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE competition ILIKE '%UEFA Euro 2008%';
Result:
- Date: June 2, 2007; Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan; Score: 1 - 3; Result: Lost; Competition: UEFA Euro 2008 Qualifying

Refinement to explicitly filter 1–3 results in UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE competition ILIKE '%UEFA Euro 2008%' AND (score = '1 - 3' OR score = '1-3' OR score = '1 – 3' OR score = '1–3');
Result:
- Date: June 2, 2007; Venue: Baku, Azerbaijan; Score: 1 - 3; Result: Lost; Competition: UEFA Euro 2008 Qualifying
Interpretation: The dataset shows a 1–3 UEFA Euro 2008 Qualifying match, but it was held in Baku, Azerbaijan—not Andorra la Vella.

Step 2: Check for any matches held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra, and inspect their scores and competitions.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE venue ILIKE '%Andorra%';
Result:
- Date: June 4, 2008; Venue: Andorra la Vella, Andorra; Score: 1 - 2; Result: Win; Competition: Friendly
Interpretation: There is a match in Andorra la Vella with score 1–2, but it is a Friendly, not UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying.

Step 3: Directly test whether any row matches both UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying and the venue Andorra la Vella.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result, competition FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE competition LIKE '%UEFA Euro 2008%' AND venue LIKE '%Andorra la Vella%';
Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion based on evidence: The available data contains (a) a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a 1–3 score held in Baku, Azerbaijan, and (b) a match held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra with a 1–2 score that was a Friendly. There is no record of a UEFA Euro 2008 qualifying match with a 1–3 score being held in Andorra la Vella, Andorra.
