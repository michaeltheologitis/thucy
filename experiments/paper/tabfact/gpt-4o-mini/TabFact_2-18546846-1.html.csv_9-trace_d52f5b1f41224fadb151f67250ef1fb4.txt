Summary conclusion: The data shows the San Francisco 49ers played the Los Angeles Dons twice in the 1947 season, not once.

Data source discovery:
- Available table: t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, score, record)

Evidence 1 – Distinct opponents include Los Angeles Dons:
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY opponent;
- Result (excerpt): Baltimore Colts; Brooklyn Dodgers; Buffalo Bills; Chicago Rockets; Cleveland Browns; Los Angeles Dons; New York Yankees

Evidence 2 – Count of games vs Los Angeles Dons (pattern match to avoid potential hidden formatting):
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_ilike FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Los Angeles Dons%';
- Result: 2

Evidence 3 – Full details of games vs Los Angeles Dons:
- SQL: SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Los Angeles Dons%' ORDER BY week;
- Results:
  - Week 2 | September 7, 1947 | Los Angeles Dons | Result: Win | Score: 17 - 14 | Record: 2 - 0
  - Week 9 | November 2, 1947 | Los Angeles Dons | Result: Win | Score: 26 - 16 | Record: 6 - 2 - 1

Note on query method: An exact-equality test returned zero (SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS games_vs_dons FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE opponent = 'Los Angeles Dons'; Result: 0). Given the contradiction with the distinct-opponents list and the detailed matches above, this likely reflects a text-formatting nuance (e.g., hidden characters). Using a robust pattern match (ILIKE) surfaces the two correct games documented above.

Assumptions made:
- “los angeles dones” refers to the AAFC team Los Angeles Dons.
- The table t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season is a complete record of the 49ers’ 1947 schedule/results.
