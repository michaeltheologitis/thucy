Claim to verify: "In the year 2000, Shane Hall DNF'd half of his races."

Data source discovery:
- Available PostgreSQL database with a table named public.shane_hall containing yearly statistics for Shane Hall (columns include year, races, dnf, etc.).

Key evidence from the database:
1) Retrieve races and DNFs for 2000
SQL executed:
SELECT races, dnf FROM shane_hall WHERE year = 2000;
Result: races = 2, dnf = 1

2) Compute DNF ratio directly in SQL
SQL executed:
SELECT 1.0 * (SELECT dnf FROM shane_hall WHERE year = 2000) / (SELECT races FROM shane_hall WHERE year = 2000) AS dnf_ratio;
Result: dnf_ratio = 0.5

Conclusion:
- In 2000, Shane Hall had 1 DNF out of 2 races, yielding a DNF ratio of 0.5. This matches the claim that he DNF’d half of his races that year.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the user’s phrase "dnf half of his race" as "DNF’d half of his races."
- Treated the public.shane_hall table as the authoritative yearly-stat record for Shane Hall for 2000.
