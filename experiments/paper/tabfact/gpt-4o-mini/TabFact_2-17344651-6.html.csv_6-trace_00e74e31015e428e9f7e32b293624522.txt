Claim to verify: "the new york knicks win all home game play against the boston celtic in the 1984 - 1985 season"

Data sources discovered
- Connected database: PostgreSQL
- Available relevant table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season (Boston Celtics 1984–85 season log)

Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), score (text), location (text), record (text)
  - No foreign keys or related tables reported

Evidence from data
1) Retrieve all Celtics games vs Knicks (to see dates, locations, and scores)
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, opponent, location, score, record 
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%'

Result:
- Game 34 | Date: Fri Jan 4 | Opponent: New York Knicks | Location: Boston Garden | Score: 105 - 94 | Record: 28 - 6
- Game 35 | Date: Mon Jan 7 | Opponent: New York Knicks | Location: Madison Square Garden | Score: 108 - 97 | Record: 29 - 6

2) Confirm the outcome by parsing the score and computing Boston win indicator
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, location, opponent, score,
       TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1))::int AS celtics_pts,
       TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2))::int AS opponent_pts,
       (TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1))::int > TRIM(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2))::int) AS boston_win
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%'

Result:
- Jan 4, 1985 | Boston Garden | New York Knicks | 105 - 94 | celtics_pts=105 | opponent_pts=94 | boston_win=TRUE
- Jan 7, 1985 | Madison Square Garden | New York Knicks | 108 - 97 | celtics_pts=108 | opponent_pts=97 | boston_win=TRUE

3) Count and list Knicks home (Madison Square Garden) games vs Celtics and outcome
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%' AND location ILIKE '%Madison Square Garden%';

Executed SQL (details with computed result):
SELECT *, 
  CASE 
    WHEN CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) > CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER) THEN 'Celtics Win'
    ELSE 'Celtics Lose'
  END AS result
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Knicks%' AND location ILIKE '%Madison Square Garden%';

Results:
- total_rows = 1
- Game at Madison Square Garden (Jan 7): Score 108 - 97 → Result: Celtics Win

Conclusion
- The data show one Knicks home game vs the Celtics in the 1984–85 season (Jan 7 at Madison Square Garden), and Boston won 108–97. Therefore, the claim that the Knicks won all home games against the Celtics in 1984–85 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- "Home game" for the Knicks is interpreted as games with location listed as "Madison Square Garden."
- The score column is from the Boston Celtics perspective (first number = Celtics points, second number = opponent points), consistent with the computed win flags and progression of the Boston record.
- The table represents the 1984–85 season game log for the Celtics (regular season). No additional Knicks home games beyond what is present in this authoritative dataset are assumed.
