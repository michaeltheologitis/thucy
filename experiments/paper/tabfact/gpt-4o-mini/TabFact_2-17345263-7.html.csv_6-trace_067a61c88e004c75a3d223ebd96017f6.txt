Summary conclusion: The data show no game with attendance 33,002 in the available East Carolina Pirates (1990–1999) dataset. The only game versus UAB in this dataset had an attendance of 31,002, not 33,002. Therefore, the claim that “UAB was the opponent when the attendance was 33,002” is not supported.

Data discovery
- Available source: public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 (columns: date text, opponent text, site text, result text, attendance text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any game with attendance = 33,002 (ignoring commas)
- Result: No rows returned.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE REPLACE(attendance, ',', '')::int = 33002;

2) Retrieve all games vs UAB (University of Alabama at Birmingham)
- Result: One game found:
  • Date: October 10
  • Opponent: UAB
  • Site: Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium, Greenville, NC
  • Result: W 26 - 7
  • Attendance: 31,002
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance 
  FROM east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%UAB%' OR opponent ILIKE '%Alabama-Birmingham%';

3) Confirm games with attendance = 31,002 (ignoring commas)
- Result: The same UAB game appears with attendance 31,002.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE REPLACE(attendance, ',', '')::int = 31002;

Conclusion
- There is no evidence of any game with attendance 33,002 in this dataset. The UAB game had 31,002 attendance. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “UAB” refers to the University of Alabama at Birmingham.
- The claim pertains to the East Carolina Pirates football dataset (1990–1999) available in the connected data source.
- Attendance comparison is based on exact numeric value after removing formatting (commas).
