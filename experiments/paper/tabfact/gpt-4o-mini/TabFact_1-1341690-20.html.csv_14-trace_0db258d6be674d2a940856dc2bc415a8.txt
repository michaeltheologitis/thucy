Assessment
- The data shows that in 1974, Parren (spelled “Parron” in the incumbent field) Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland’s 7th District and was unopposed. Therefore, he did not defeat Elton R. Wampler in MD-7.
- Elton R. Wampler was the Republican candidate in Maryland’s 6th District, where he lost to Goodloe Byron (D).

Conclusion
- The statement is partially incorrect: Mitchell was re-elected in MD-7, but he did not defeat Elton R. Wampler; Wampler ran in MD-6 and lost to Goodloe Byron.

Assumptions made
- The claim pertains to the 1974 election cycle, which is the scope of the available data. If a different year was intended, it is not represented in the accessible dataset.
