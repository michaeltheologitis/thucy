Assessment:
- The claim that Tiger Woods “scored 211 placing 5th” is contradicted by the data. In this dataset, Tiger Woods is 1st with a total of 205. While a score of 211 did correspond to tied 5th, that result belongs to Robert Allenby, Pádraig Harrington, and Billy Mayfair—not Tiger Woods.

Assumptions:
- "tiger wood" refers to Tiger Woods.
- The claim is interpreted against the available authoritative dataset for the 2002 U.S. Open, where place values like "t5" are treated as tied for 5th.
