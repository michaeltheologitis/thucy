Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “the Buffalo Bills lose more games than they win.” Given the available data source only covers the 1976 Buffalo Bills season, I verify this claim for that season.

Data source explored:
- Table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Evidence and SQL used:
1) Distinct results and their counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season GROUP BY result;
Result snapshot:
- l 20 - 10 : 1
- l 27 - 14 : 1
- l 31 - 13 : 1
- l 34 - 13 : 1
- l 26 - 22 : 1
- l 30 - 21 : 1
- l 45 - 27 : 1
- w 14 - 9 : 1
- l 19 - 14 : 1
- l 58 - 20 : 1
- w 50 - 17 : 1
- l 13 - 3 : 1
- l 17 - 14 : 1
- l 17 - 10 : 1
Observation: 2 entries start with “w” and 12 start with “l”.

2) Aggregated counts of wins, losses, ties, and total games
Executed SQL:
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 'w%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS wins,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 'l%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS losses,
    SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(result) LIKE 't%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS ties,
    COUNT(*) AS total_games
FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season;
Results:
- Wins: 2
- Losses: 12
- Ties: 0
- Total games: 14

Conclusion based on evidence: In the 1976 season, the Buffalo Bills lost more games than they won (12 losses vs 2 wins). Therefore, under this season-specific scope, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- The claim is interpreted to refer specifically to the 1976 Buffalo Bills season, because that is the only Bills-related dataset available in the connected data source.
- Classification of results is based on the first character of the result field: entries beginning with 'w' are wins, 'l' are losses, 't' are ties (case-insensitive).
