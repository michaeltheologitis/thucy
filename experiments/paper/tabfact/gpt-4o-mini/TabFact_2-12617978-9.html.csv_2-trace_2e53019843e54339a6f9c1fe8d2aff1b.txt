Claim interpreted: “game alert ask for 200000” likely asserts that there is an entry named “Game Alert” that requested 200,000 (currency presumed GBP) in the accessible dataset.

Data source discovery
- Tool: discover_data_sources
- Result: Available database: TabFact; Schema: public; Table: dragons_den_uk (Dragons’ Den UK episodes with columns including money requested)

Schema inspection
- Tool: schema_query
- Query: “List all available databases, schemas, and tables with brief descriptions.”
- Result summary: Database TabFact, schema public, table dragons_den_uk with columns:
  • episode (text)
  • first aired (text)
  • entrepreneur(s) (text)
  • company or product name (text)
  • money requested (bigint)
  • investing dragon(s) (text)

Evidence-gathering attempts and executed SQL
- I attempted to run SQL via the nl_query_traceable tool (which returns both results and the exact executed SQL) to directly verify whether a row exists where company or product name contains “Game Alert” and money requested = 200000. However, each attempt failed due to a tool execution error (“Max turns (10) exceeded”), so no row-level data or executed SQL could be retrieved from the database during this session.

Intended (but not executed due to tool error) SQL queries
Note: The following are the precise queries I prepared to execute; they did not run successfully, so they did not generate evidence in this session.
1) SELECT episode, "first aired", "entrepreneur(s)", "company or product name", "money requested", "investing dragon(s)"
   FROM public.dragons_den_uk
   WHERE lower("company or product name") LIKE '%game alert%'
     AND "money requested" = 200000;
2) SELECT episode, "first aired", "entrepreneur(s)", "company or product name", "money requested"
   FROM public.dragons_den_uk
   WHERE lower("company or product name") LIKE '%game%'
   ORDER BY "money requested" DESC
   LIMIT 50;

Conclusion
- Because the row-level verification query could not be executed, I could not gather evidence from the available data to confirm or refute the claim. Therefore, the claim is unsupported by evidence in this verification session.

Assumptions made
- “game alert” refers to a company or product name value in the dragons_den_uk table.
- “ask for 200000” refers to the money requested field being exactly 200,000 (GBP). If the claim refers to a different dataset or domain, it is outside the scope of the available data sources identified here.
