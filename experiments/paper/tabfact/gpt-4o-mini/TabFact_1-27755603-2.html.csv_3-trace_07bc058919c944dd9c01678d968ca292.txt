Step 1: Discover available data source
- Data source found: a PostgreSQL table named t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season in the public schema containing Detroit Pistons 2010–11 season game summaries.

Step 2: Inspect schema to understand where to verify the claim
- Schema details for t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season:
  - game (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - team (text)
  - score (text)
  - high points (text)
  - high rebounds (text)
  - high assists (text)
  - location attendance (text)
  - record (text)
- Relevant columns for this claim:
  - high assists: contains the Pistons’ player with the most assists and the count, e.g., "Will Bynum (5)".
  - location attendance: contains the venue name and attendance, e.g., "Carrier Dome 11747" (or formatted as "Carrier Dome (11,747)").

Step 3: Retrieve the game(s) at Carrier Dome and check assist leader and attendance
Query and evidence 1: List the game(s) where the venue contains "Carrier Dome"
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, game, team, "score", "high assists", "location attendance" 
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season 
WHERE "location attendance" LIKE '%Carrier Dome%';

Result:
- Date: October 15
- Game: 5
- Team: Minnesota
- Score: L 88 - 99 (OT)
- High Assists: Will Bynum (5)
- Location Attendance: Carrier Dome (11,747)

Query and evidence 2: Confirm there is only one Carrier Dome entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count
FROM t_2010_11_detroit_pistons_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Carrier Dome%';

Result:
- game_count: 1

Assessment of each part of the claim
- "player will bynum (5) score the highest number of assist in the game": Supported by the "high assists" field for the Carrier Dome game, which lists Will Bynum (5). Note: "high assists" reflects the Pistons’ team leader.
- "the attendance be 11747 people at the carrier dome": Supported by the "location attendance" field, which shows "Carrier Dome (11,747)", i.e., 11,747 attendees.

Conclusion
- The data shows that in Game 5 (October 15) against Minnesota, played at Carrier Dome, the Pistons’ high assists leader was Will Bynum with 5, and the recorded attendance was 11,747. This directly matches the claim.

Assumptions
- "highest number of assist in the game" is interpreted as the Detroit Pistons’ team leader in assists, because the available dataset records only Pistons’ leaders and does not provide opponent leaders.
