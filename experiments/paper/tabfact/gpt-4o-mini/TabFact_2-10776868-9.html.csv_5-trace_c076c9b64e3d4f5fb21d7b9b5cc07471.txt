Conclusion: The claim is not supported. The available 1962 VFL match data shows games occurring in June 1962, which means the VFL season did not begin in July.

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: public.t_1962_vfl_season.
- Table columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text).

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Query to retrieve sample rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season LIMIT 5;
Result highlights (all rows shown had the same date):
- Melbourne vs St Kilda at MCG, Crowd 48,952, Date: 23 June 1962
- Essendon vs Geelong at Windy Hill, Crowd 35,000, Date: 23 June 1962
- Collingwood vs Fitzroy at Victoria Park, Crowd 26,488, Date: 23 June 1962
- Carlton vs Footscray at Princes Park, Crowd 32,400, Date: 23 June 1962
- South Melbourne vs Richmond at Lake Oval, Crowd 17,000, Date: 23 June 1962

2) Query to list distinct dates present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Result: 23 June 1962

3) Query to find the earliest and latest date values
SQL:
SELECT MIN(date) as earliest_date, MAX(date) as latest_date FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season;
Result: earliest_date = 23 June 1962; latest_date = 23 June 1962

Interpretation
- The dataset contains VFL matches dated 23 June 1962. Therefore, VFL competition activity was underway in June, contradicting the claim that it began in July.

Assumptions
- "VFL" refers to the main VFL premiership match fixtures. The presence of matches on June 23, 1962 is sufficient to show the season began before July. The database table is treated as accurate and complete within its scope, which includes at least some 1962 VFL match records.
