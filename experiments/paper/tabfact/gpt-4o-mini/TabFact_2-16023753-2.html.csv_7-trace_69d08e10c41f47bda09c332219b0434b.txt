Claim to verify: “the most point score by the dolphin in a game be 34 point.”

Summary conclusion: Based on the available authoritative dataset (Miami Dolphins 1983 season), the highest single-game point total by the Dolphins in that season was 38 points, not 34. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data we have.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Available table: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (Miami Dolphins 1983 season).
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Schema confirmation
- The table’s result column stores outcomes like “w 34 - 24” or “l 27 - 14”. The first token is outcome (w/l), followed by the two scores separated by a hyphen. We must parse scores carefully because losses list the opponent’s score first.

Evidence
1) Inspect score formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, result FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season LIMIT 5;

Observed sample (tool output):
- buffalo bills | w 12 - 0
- new england patriots | w 34 - 24
- los angeles raiders | l 27 - 14
- kansas city chiefs | w 14 - 6
- new orleans saints | l 17 - 7

Interpretation: For wins, the first number is Miami’s points; for losses, the second number is Miami’s points.

2) Compute Dolphins’ points per game correctly and find the maximum
Executed SQL:
WITH game_results AS (
    SELECT week,
           opponent,
           result,
           LOWER(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1)) AS outcome,
           CASE WHEN LOWER(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1)) = 'w' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '([0-9]+)\s*-')::int
                WHEN LOWER(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1)) = 'l' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '-\s*([0-9]+)')::int
                ELSE SUBSTRING(result FROM '([0-9]+)\s*-')::int END AS dolphins_points,
           CASE WHEN LOWER(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1)) = 'w' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '-\s*([0-9]+)')::int
                WHEN LOWER(SPLIT_PART(result, ' ', 1)) = 'l' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '([0-9]+)\s*-')::int
                ELSE SUBSTRING(result FROM '-\s*([0-9]+)')::int END AS opponent_points
    FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
),
max_points AS (
    SELECT MAX(dolphins_points) AS max_points
    FROM game_results
)
SELECT gr.week,
       gr.opponent,
       gr.result,
       gr.outcome,
       gr.dolphins_points,
       gr.opponent_points,
       CASE WHEN (gr.outcome = 'w' AND gr.dolphins_points > gr.opponent_points)
            OR (gr.outcome = 'l' AND gr.dolphins_points < gr.opponent_points)
            THEN 'ok' ELSE NULL END AS consistency_flag
FROM game_results gr
JOIN max_points mp ON gr.dolphins_points = mp.max_points;

Result (tool output):
- Week: 13 | Opponent: Cincinnati Bengals | Result: w 38 - 14 | Outcome: w | Dolphins Points: 38 | Opponent Points: 14 | Consistency: ok

Finding: Maximum Dolphins points in a 1983 game = 38 (Week 13 vs Cincinnati Bengals). This directly contradicts the claim that the most is 34.

Conclusion
- The claim “the most point score by the dolphin in a game be 34 point” is not supported by the available data. In the 1983 season dataset, the highest single-game total is 38, not 34.

Assumptions and scope
- “dolphin” is interpreted as the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- Due to available data scope, verification is performed against the 1983 season table. Broader franchise-history data was not accessible in this environment. Within this scope, the claim is inaccurate.
