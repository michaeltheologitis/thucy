Summary conclusion:
- The claim is not supported. In the available 2008–09 Guildford Flames season data, the man of the match against the Slough Jets on the date recorded as “2nd” is Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital. Lukas Smital was man of the match for the Slough Jets game recorded as “1st”.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Retrieve all Guildford Flames matches vs Slough to inspect dates and men of the match
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, competition, result, attendance, "man of the match" 
FROM t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Slough%' 
ORDER BY date;
Result (pertinent fields summarized):
- Date: 1st | Opponent: Slough Jets | Venue: Home | Competition: League / Cup | Result: Lost 2 - 3 | Attendance: 1308 | Man of the Match: Lukas Smital
- Date: 2nd | Opponent: Slough Jets | Venue: Away | Competition: League | Result: Lost 5 - 6 (OT) | Attendance: 320 | Man of the Match: Paul Dixon

2) Directly verify the match recorded on “2nd” vs Slough Jets
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, competition, result, attendance, "man of the match" 
FROM t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Slough%' AND date = '2nd';
Result (pertinent fields summarized):
- Date: 2nd | Opponent: Slough Jets | Venue: Away | Competition: League | Result: Lost 5-6 (OT) | Attendance: 320 | Man of the Match: Paul Dixon

Interpretation:
- For the match vs Slough Jets on the “2nd,” the recorded man of the match is Paul Dixon, not Lukas Smital. Lukas Smital is recorded as man of the match for the fixture listed as “1st.”

Assumptions made:
- “Slough jet” is interpreted as “Slough Jets.”
- “on the 2nd” refers to the game in this dataset whose date field equals “2nd.”
- The verification is constrained to the authoritative 2008–09 Guildford Flames season table available in the connected data source.
