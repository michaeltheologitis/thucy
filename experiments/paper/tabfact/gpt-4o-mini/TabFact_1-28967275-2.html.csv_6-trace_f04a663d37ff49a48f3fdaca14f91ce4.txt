Claim interpreted: The episode with series number 14 has the title “new rule.”

What I checked
1) All episodes in series 14 and their titles.
2) Whether any episode in the dataset has the exact title “new rule” (case-insensitive).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Episodes in series 14
- Result: One row found — Episode 40 with title "new order".
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "episode title" FROM my_info_table WHERE series = 14;

2) Any episode titled “new rule” (case-insensitive)
- Result: No rows found.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT series, episode, "episode title" 
  FROM my_info_table 
  WHERE lower("episode title") = 'new rule';

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that for series = 14, the episode title is “new order,” not “new rule.”
- Additionally, there is no episode titled exactly “new rule” anywhere in the data.

Final assessment: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Series number 14” refers to the value in the column named series in the table my_info_table.
- Title matching is done case-insensitively for verifying the literal phrase “new rule.”
