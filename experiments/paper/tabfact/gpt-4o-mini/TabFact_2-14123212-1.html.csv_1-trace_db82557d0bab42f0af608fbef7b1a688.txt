Summary assessment
- Claim interpreted as: “All translator stations in the available dataset are Class D.”
- Result: The available dataset (public.whlp) contains 0 rows; therefore, there are 0 translator rows to evaluate. The claim is unsupported by evidence in this data environment.

Data discovery and schema
- Discovered data sources: a PostgreSQL database with a single table public.whlp.
- Schema (via schema inspection): columns = [call sign (text), frequency mhz (double precision), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text)]. No primary key or constraints identified.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine table row count
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp;
Result: 0

2) Attempt to view sample call signs and class values (no rows present)
SQL: SELECT "call sign", "class" FROM public.whlp LIMIT 20;
Result: 0 rows

3) Identify FM translator rows by call sign pattern (translators typically match ^[KW][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}$)
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ~ '^[KW][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}$';
Result: 0

4) Distinct class values among translator rows
SQL: SELECT "class", COUNT(*) FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ~ '^[KW][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}$' GROUP BY "class";
Result: 0 rows

5) Count translator rows that are Class D vs not Class D
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "class" ILIKE 'D') AS count_d, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE "class" ILIKE 'D' OR "class" IS NULL) AS count_not_d FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ~ '^[KW][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}$';
Result: count_d = 0, count_not_d = 0

Conclusion
- The dataset has no records. Consequently, there are no translator entries to evaluate, and the claim “all of the translator be class d” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- “Translator” refers to FM translator stations, operationalized by the U.S. translator call sign pattern: one of K/W, followed by three digits, then two letters (regex: ^[KW][0-9]{3}[A-Z]{2}$).
- “Class D” refers to the value 'D' in the class column.
- The claim is intended to be evaluated solely against the available dataset (public.whlp).
