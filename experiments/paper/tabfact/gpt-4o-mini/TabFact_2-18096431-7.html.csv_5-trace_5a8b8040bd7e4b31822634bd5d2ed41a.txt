Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database containing one relevant table: public.t_1996_pga_championship.
- Table columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint).

Evidence
1) Identify the player(s) who earned the most money in the 1996 PGA Championship
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, money
FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship
WHERE money = (SELECT MAX(money) FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship);

Result:
- Mark Brooks — 430000

2) Kenny Perry’s result and earnings in the 1996 PGA Championship
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE 'Kenny Perry';

Result:
- place: 2nd, money: 260000

Conclusion
Based on the available dataset for the 1996 PGA Championship, the player who earned the most money was Mark Brooks ($430,000). Kenny Perry finished 2nd with $260,000. Therefore, the claim that “kenny perry [is] the player who earn[s] the most money” is not supported by this data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available database (1996 PGA Championship results), since no other datasets (e.g., all-time PGA Tour career earnings) are accessible here.
- The claim’s phrasing is ambiguous; if it intended career earnings or another event, those data are not present in the accessible source.
