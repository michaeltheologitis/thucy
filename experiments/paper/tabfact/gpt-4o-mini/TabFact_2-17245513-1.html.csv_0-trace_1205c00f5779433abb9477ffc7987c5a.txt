Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Peter Oosterhuis finished T7 and won $7,500.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema
- Table: t_1975_u_s_open_golf (1975 U.S. Open results)
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text), money (text)

Evidence from data:
1) Locate Peter Oosterhuis and check place and money
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, money FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(player) = LOWER('Peter Oosterhuis');
Result summary: Returns Peter Oosterhuis with place = T7 and money = $7500.

2) Cross-check full row for name containing 'Oosterhuis'
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1975_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Oosterhuis%';
Result details:
- Player: Peter Oosterhuis
- Place: T7
- Country: England
- Score: 69 + 73 + 72 + 75 = 289
- To Par: +5
- Money: $7500

Assessment of the claim:
- “T7 be the place of Peter Oosterhuis” — Supported by the data (Place = T7).
- “who win 7500” — Supported by the data (Money = $7500). Minor formatting differences like $7,500 vs $7500 are acceptable.

Conclusion: The claim matches the 1975 U.S. Open data in the available table.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1975 U.S. Open results, which is the relevant data source available.
- “win 7500” is interpreted as prize money of $7,500.
- “t7” is interpreted as tied for 7th place (T7).
