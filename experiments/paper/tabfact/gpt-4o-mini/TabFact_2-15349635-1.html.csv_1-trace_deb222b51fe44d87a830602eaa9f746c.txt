Summary
Claim: “the top 2 team have the same number of point but separate by a goal difference.”
Conclusion: Verified against the available standings data in the database.

Data discovery
- We first enumerated available tables and confirmed the presence of a relevant table.
Executed SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' 
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
Result highlight: The list includes public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.

Schema and sample data inspection
- We inspected the table schema and sampled rows.
Executed SQL (columns):
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, column_default  
FROM information_schema.columns  
WHERE table_schema = 'public'  
AND table_name = 't_1940_in_brazilian_football';
Key columns relevant to the claim: position (bigint), team (text), points (bigint), difference (text).
Executed SQL (sample rows):
SELECT * FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football LIMIT 5;
Sample (from tool output):
1) position=1, team=flamengo, points=13, played=8, against=12, difference=8
2) position=2, team=fluminense, points=13, played=8, against=15, difference=10

Top-2 verification by standings position
- We retrieved the top two teams by position and examined their points and goal differences.
Executed SQL (top 2 rows):
SELECT position, team, points, played, against, difference FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football ORDER BY position ASC LIMIT 2;
Result (from tool output):
1) Flamengo — Points: 13 — Difference: 8
2) Fluminense — Points: 13 — Difference: 10

Boolean check (single-row summary)
- We programmatically verified the conditions: two rows exist, points are equal, goal differences are different.
Executed SQL:
WITH top2 AS (
  SELECT position, team, points, difference
  FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
  ORDER BY position ASC
  LIMIT 2
)
SELECT
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM top2) = 2 AS have_two,
  MIN(points) = MAX(points) AS equal_points,
  MIN(difference)::int <> MAX(difference)::int AS different_goal_diff
FROM top2;
Result: have_two=true, equal_points=true, different_goal_diff=true.

Assessment
- The data shows the top two teams by position both have 13 points and different goal differences (8 vs 10). This directly supports the claim that the top two are tied on points and separated by goal difference.

Assumptions
- “Top 2 team” refers to the first two rows by standings position in public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- “Point” corresponds to the points column.
- “Goal difference” corresponds to the difference column, which is stored as text but represents numeric goal difference.
- The claim pertains to the standings captured in this table (Brazilian football, 1940 context as per table name).
