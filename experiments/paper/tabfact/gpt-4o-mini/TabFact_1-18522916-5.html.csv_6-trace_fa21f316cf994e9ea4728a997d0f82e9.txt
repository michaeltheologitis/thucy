Claim to verify: “Daniel Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008 and replaced by Carlos de Toro on 29 December 2008.”

Findings grounded in data:
- Daniel Uberti: The dataset records that Daniel Uberti (team: Nejapa) was sacked, with the vacancy dated 29 December 2008. This supports the “sacked on 29 December 2008” part of the claim.
- Replacement: The same record shows he was replaced by Nelson Ancheta, appointed on 29 December 2008. There is no record that Carlos de Toro replaced Daniel Uberti.
- Carlos de Toro: The dataset does include Carlos de Toro as a replacement manager, but for a different team and date: Balboa, appointed 16 January 2009, replacing Roberto Gamarra.

Evidence (executed SQL and returned results):
1) Search around 29 December 2008 and for the named managers
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE "outgoing manager" = 'Daniel Uberti' OR "replaced by" = 'Carlos de Toro' OR "date of vacancy" = '2008-12-29' OR "date of vacancy" BETWEEN '2008-12-28' AND '2008-12-30';

Returned (excerpt):
- Team: Nejapa; Outgoing Manager: Daniel Uberti; Manner of Departure: Sacked; Date of Vacancy: 29 December 2008; Replaced By: Nelson Ancheta; Date of Appointment: 29 December 2008; Position in Table: Post-season (10th)

2) Confirm all rows with vacancy on 29 December 2008
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE "date of vacancy"::date = '2008-12-29';

Returned includes the same Nejapa row showing Uberti sacked on 2008-12-29 and replaced by Nelson Ancheta on the same date.

3) Robust search for Uberti by substring
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 WHERE "outgoing manager" ILIKE '%Uberti%';

Returned:
- Team: Nejapa; Outgoing Manager: Daniel Uberti; Manner of Departure: Sacked; Date of Vacancy: 29 December 2008; Replaced By: Nelson Ancheta; Date of Appointment: 29 December 2008; Position in Table: Post - Season (10th)

4) Search for any occurrence of Carlos de Toro
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008
WHERE LOWER("outgoing manager") LIKE '%de toro%' OR LOWER("replaced by") LIKE '%de toro%';

Returned:
- Team: Balboa; Outgoing Manager: Roberto Gamarra; Manner of Departure: Mutual Consent; Date of Vacancy: 1 January 2009; Replaced By: Carlos de Toro; Date of Appointment: 16 January 2009; Position in Table: Post - Season (7th)

Conclusion:
- True: Daniel Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008.
- False: He was not replaced by Carlos de Toro on that date; he was replaced by Nelson Ancheta on 29 December 2008. Carlos de Toro appears elsewhere in the dataset (Balboa) and on a different date (16 January 2009).

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to managerial changes in the “Primera División de Fútbol Profesional Apertura 2008” dataset available in the connected PostgreSQL database.
- “Be sack” is interpreted as “was sacked.”
