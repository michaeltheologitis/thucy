Evidence of a 5-game streak
3) Executed SQL (ordered game log with leading scorers):
SELECT game, date, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season ORDER BY game;

Returned excerpt shows the closing stretch of the season:
- Game 77: April 5 — High Points: Brook Lopez (30)
- Game 78: April 6 — High Points: Brook Lopez (39)
- Game 79: April 8 — High Points: Brook Lopez (27)
- Game 80: April 10 — High Points: Brook Lopez (35)
- Game 81: April 11 — High Points: Brook Lopez (31)

Analysis
- The per-game “high points” field identifies the Nets’ leading scorer each game.
- In games 77 through 81 (five consecutive games), the leading scorer is Brook Lopez, as shown in the ordered game log query above.
- This directly satisfies the claim that Brook Lopez led the team in points for 5 straight games (at least once during the 2010–11 season covered by this dataset).

Conclusion
- Based on the game log, Brook Lopez did lead the team in points for five consecutive games (Games 77–81).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “lead the team in point” as being listed as the team’s “high points” leader in the game log.
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (2010–11 New Jersey Nets).
