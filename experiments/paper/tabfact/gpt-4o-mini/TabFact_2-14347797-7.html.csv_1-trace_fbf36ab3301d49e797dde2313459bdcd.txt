What I checked
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season, containing game-level data for the Philadelphia Flyers’ 2003–04 season. Columns: game (bigint), february (bigint), opponent (text), score (text), record (text), points (bigint).

Evidence from the data
1) Query to retrieve the game on February 24 (day-of-month stored in column "february"):
SQL executed:
SELECT game, february, opponent, score, record, points 
FROM public.t_2003_04_philadelphia_flyers_season 
WHERE february = 24;

Result:
- Game: 64
- February: 24
- Opponent: Chicago Blackhawks
- Score: 3 - 1
- Record: 33 - 15 - 11 - 5
- Points: 82

Conclusion
- The data shows that on February 24 of the 2003–04 season, the Flyers’ game ended 3 - 1, not 5 - 4. Therefore, the claim that “the score be 5 - 4 on February 24” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- Because the only available dataset covers the Philadelphia Flyers’ 2003–04 season and stores February dates in a "february" column, I interpreted “February 24” as February 24, 2004 within that season and verified the Flyers’ game on that date.
