Claim interpreted: Among players who finished under par, a majority are from the United States (based on the available 1989 U.S. Open golf dataset).

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema contains table t_1989_u_s_open_golf with columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distribution of "to par" values (to understand how many players were under par)
SQL executed:
SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY "to par";
Result (rows):
- + 2: 1
- - 1: 3
- + 1: 2
- - 2: 1
- + 3: 4
- e: 1
Interpretation: Under par values are "- 1" (3 rows) and "- 2" (1 row), totaling 4 players under par.

2) Under-par players by country
SQL executed:
SELECT country, COUNT(*) AS player_count
FROM (
    SELECT country,
           CASE 
               WHEN "to par" = 'e' THEN 0
               ELSE CAST(REPLACE("to par", ' ', '') AS INTEGER)
           END AS to_par_value
    FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
) AS parsed_scores
WHERE to_par_value < 0
GROUP BY country;
Result:
- United States: 3 players
- Wales: 1 player
Interpretation: Of the 4 under-par players, 3 are from the United States (75%).

3) List of under-par finishers (for transparency)
SQL executed:
SELECT player, country, score, CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE("to par", ' ', ''), 'e', '0') AS INTEGER) AS to_par 
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf 
WHERE CAST(REPLACE(REPLACE("to par", ' ', ''), 'e', '0') AS INTEGER) < 0;
Result:
- Curtis Strange — United States — 71 + 64 + 73 + 70 = 278 — To-par: -2
- Chip Beck — United States — 71 + 69 + 71 + 68 = 279 — To-par: -1
- Mark McCumber — United States — 70 + 68 + 72 + 69 = 279 — To-par: -1
- Ian Woosnam — Wales — 70 + 68 + 73 + 68 = 279 — To-par: -1

Conclusion
- Based on the dataset, a majority (3 out of 4; 75%) of the players who finished under par are from the United States. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "Score under par" is interpreted as final tournament to-par less than 0 (i.e., under-par aggregate finish), not individual round performance.
- "united state" refers to the country value "United States" in the dataset.
- The verification is limited to the available dataset (1989 U.S. Open table), which is treated as accurate and complete within its scope.
