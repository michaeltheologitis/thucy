Claim to verify: "Google Chrome supports both VP8 (WebM) 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) 29.0."

Data source discovery:
- Used the discovery tool to identify available data. It reported a PostgreSQL database with a table public.html5_video related to HTML5 video/codec data.

Schema exploration:
- To confirm available tables in the public schema:
SQL executed:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result: html5_video

- To list columns of public.html5_video:
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'html5_video' AND table_schema = 'public';
Result columns:
- browser (text)
- operating system (text)
- latest stable release (text)
- theora (text)
- h264 (text)
- vp8 ( webm ) (text)
- vp9 ( webm ) (text)

Evidence retrieval:
- Query rows for Google Chrome and retrieve VP8 and VP9 columns.
SQL executed:
SELECT browser, "vp8 ( webm )", "vp9 ( webm )" 
FROM public.html5_video 
WHERE browser ILIKE '%Chrome%';
Observed result:
- browser: google chrome
- vp8 ( webm ): 6.0
- vp9 ( webm ): 29.0

Assessment:
- The database entry for google chrome lists VP8 (WebM) as 6.0 and VP9 (WebM) as 29.0. This directly matches the claim that Chrome supports VP8 starting at 6.0 and VP9 starting at 29.0.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The values in the vp8 ( webm ) and vp9 ( webm ) columns represent the earliest Chrome version that introduced support for each codec.
- The single row for "google chrome" is representative across operating systems unless otherwise specified by additional rows (none were needed for this verification).
