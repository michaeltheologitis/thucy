Overview of data sources discovered:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: isabel_cueto
  - Columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent in the final (text), score (text)

Goal interpreted: Verify whether, on 9 July 1990, the opponent in the final was Katerina Maleeva (for Isabel Cueto’s finals, per available data).

Evidence 1: All Isabel Cueto entries in 1990
Result:
- Date: 9 July 1990
- Tournament: Palermo, Italy
- Surface: Clay
- Opponent in the Final: Barbara Paulus
- Score: 6 - 2, 6 - 3
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", score FROM public.isabel_cueto WHERE date::date >= '1990-01-01' AND date::date < '1991-01-01';

Evidence 2: Exact match for opponent = Katerina Maleeva
Result: No rows found.
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, score 
FROM isabel_cueto 
WHERE "opponent in the final" = 'Katerina Maleeva';

Evidence 3: Case-insensitive search for any Maleeva final
Result:
- Date: 31 July 1989
- Tournament: sofia, bulgaria
- Surface: clay
- Opponent in the Final: katerina maleeva
- Score: 6 - 2 , 7 - 6 (3)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM isabel_cueto WHERE "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%Maleeva%';

Conclusion: The database shows that on 9 July 1990, Isabel Cueto’s opponent in the final was Barbara Paulus—not Katerina Maleeva. While Isabel Cueto did face Katerina Maleeva in a final, that occurred on 31 July 1989 in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to Isabel Cueto’s finals (the only available data source concerns Isabel Cueto). The date is interpreted literally as 9 July 1990 per the dataset’s date field.
- The provided database is complete and authoritative for Isabel Cueto’s finals.
