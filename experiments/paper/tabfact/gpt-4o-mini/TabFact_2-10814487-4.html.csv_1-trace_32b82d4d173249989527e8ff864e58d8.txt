Claim to verify: “the super league xii score on 21 / 07 / 07 be 14 - 10.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered available data sources: A PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table t_2007_bradford_bulls_season (2007 Bradford Bulls season data).
- Verified table structure includes: date (text), home team (text), score (text), away team (text), goals (text), attendance (bigint), competition (text).

Evidence from data
- Result found: On 21/07/07, there was a Super League XII match with score 14 - 10: Salford City Reds 14 - 10 Bradford.

Executed SQL (exact)
1) Locate the match on 21 July 2007:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", competition 
FROM public.t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
WHERE "date" LIKE '%21/07/%';

Query result excerpt:
- Date: 21 / 07 / 07
- Home Team: Salford City Reds
- Score: 14 - 10
- Away Team: Bradford
- Competition: Super League XII

Assessment
- The dataset shows that on 21 July 2007 (21/07/07), a Super League XII fixture finished 14-10 (Salford City Reds vs Bradford). This directly supports the claim that “the super league xii score on 21/07/07 [was] 14 - 10,” at least for the Bradford Bulls fixture recorded in the authoritative dataset available.

Assumptions noted
- The accessible database contains the 2007 Bradford Bulls season data. I interpret the claim as asserting that there existed a Super League XII match on 21/07/07 with a 14-10 score, which is verified by the Bradford Bulls fixture that day. If the claim intended to state that all Super League matches on that date had that score, broader league-wide data would be required, but within the available authoritative source, a Super League XII match on that date did end 14-10.
