Claim to verify: “the owner of the radio station that play adult hit be bell media.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with one table: public.media_in_kelowna.

Schema overview
- media_in_kelowna columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text). No primary key.

Evidence 1: List stations with any “Adult” format in Kelowna
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency, format, owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%Adult%';
- Result (relevant fields):
  1) Call sign: CILK - FM | Branding: 101.5 ez rock | Frequency: 0 101.5 fm | Format: Adult Contemporary | Owner: Bell Media
  2) Call sign: CKQQ - FM | Branding: Q103 | Frequency: 0 103.1 fm | Format: Hot Adult Contemporary | Owner: Jim Pattison Group
  3) Call sign: CJUI - FM | Branding: 103.9 the juice | Frequency: 0 103.9 fm | Format: Adult Hits | Owner: Vista Broadcast Group

Evidence 2: Identify the station with format exactly “Adult Hits”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "call sign", branding, frequency, format, owner 
  FROM media_in_kelowna 
  WHERE LOWER(format) = LOWER('Adult Hits');
- Result: CJUI - FM | 103.9 the Juice | 0 103.9 FM | Adult Hits | Owner: Vista Broadcast Group

Assessment
- The station in Kelowna with the format “Adult Hits” is CJUI-FM (103.9 The Juice), owned by Vista Broadcast Group, not Bell Media.
- While Bell Media does own an Adult Contemporary station (CILK-FM “101.5 EZ Rock”), that is a different format from Adult Hits.

Conclusion
- The claim that the owner of the radio station that plays Adult Hits is Bell Media is contradicted by the data in this environment.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “radio station that play adult hit” as the station with format exactly “Adult Hits,” and within the Kelowna market represented by the available dataset.
- Treated the provided database as authoritative for the Kelowna media landscape at the time it was compiled.
