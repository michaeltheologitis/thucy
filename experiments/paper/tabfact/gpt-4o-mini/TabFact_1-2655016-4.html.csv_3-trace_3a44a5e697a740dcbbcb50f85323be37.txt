Summary of data sources and schema
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a table: public.list_of_all_that_episodes.
- Relevant columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "nick prod" (bigint).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count episode titles consisting only of digits (after trimming whitespace)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_of_numeric_titles
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE TRIM("episode title") ~ '^[0-9]+$';
Result: 2

2) List distinct numeric-only episode titles and their counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT "episode title", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE TRIM("episode title") ~ '^[0-9]+'$
GROUP BY "episode title";
Result:
- "702": 1
- "112": 1

3) Distinct numeric-only titles (for completeness)
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "episode title"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE TRIM("episode title") ~ '^[0-9]+$';
Result:
- "702"
- "112"

Conclusion
- There are exactly 2 episode titles in the dataset that consist entirely of digits, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim over the table public.list_of_all_that_episodes (All That episodes dataset).
- “Consist entirely of number” interpreted as titles composed solely of digits 0–9 after trimming whitespace.
