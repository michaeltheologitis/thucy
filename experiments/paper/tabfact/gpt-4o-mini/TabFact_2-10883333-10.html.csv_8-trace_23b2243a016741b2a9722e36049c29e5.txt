Claim interpreted: All of the matches are on different dates (i.e., no two matches share the same date) within the available dataset.

Data source explored:
- Database: public
- Table: t_1975_vfl_season
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Total number of matches
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result: 6

2) Count of distinct dates
SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_dates FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
Result: 1

3) Dates that have more than one match
SQL: SELECT date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY date HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
Result: 7 June 1975

4) Check for NULL or empty date values and list all distinct dates present
SQL (distinct dates excluding NULL/empty): SELECT DISTINCT "date" FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "date" IS NOT NULL AND "date" <> '';
Result: 7 June 1975
SQL (NULL/empty count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE "date" IS NULL OR "date" = '';
Result: 0

Findings:
- There are 6 matches recorded.
- There is only 1 distinct match date in the dataset: 7 June 1975.
- Therefore, multiple matches share the same date, which contradicts the claim that all matches are on different dates.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Scope is the available dataset (1975 VFL season table t_1975_vfl_season). If a different competition/season was intended, the conclusion may differ.
- Date comparison is based on the exact string value in the "date" column, which appears consistently formatted in this dataset.
