Claim to verify:
"the score on 15 / 04 / 07 in super league xii be 52 to 22 with an attendance of 9000"

Data sources explored:
- Available PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table: t_2007_bradford_bulls_season
- Table columns: date (text), home team (text), score (text), away team (text), goals (text), attendance (bigint), competition (text)

Evidence collected (with executed SQL):
1) Identify valid competition values to ensure correct filtering
Executed SQL:
SELECT competition, COUNT(*) AS row_count 
FROM t_2007_bradford_bulls_season 
GROUP BY competition;
Result summary:
- competition = "super league xii": 28 rows
- competition = "rugby league challenge cup": 4 rows

2) Retrieve the match on the exact date 15 / 04 / 07 in Super League XII
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", attendance, competition 
FROM t_2007_bradford_bulls_season 
WHERE date = '15 / 04 / 07' AND competition = 'super league xii';
Returned row:
- date: 15 / 04 / 07; home team: Bradford; score: 52 - 22; away team: Hull KR; attendance: 10,881; competition: super league xii

3) Check if any match on that date in Super League XII had attendance 9000
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", attendance 
FROM t_2007_bradford_bulls_season 
WHERE date = '15 / 04 / 07' 
  AND competition = 'super league xii' 
  AND attendance = 9000;
Result: No rows returned

4) (Context) Find any Super League XII match with attendance exactly 9000
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", score, "away team", attendance 
FROM t_2007_bradford_bulls_season 
WHERE competition = 'super league xii' AND attendance = 9000;
Returned row:
- date: 21 / 9 / 07; home team: Bradford; score: 30 - 31; away team: Wigan Warriors; attendance: 9000

Assessment:
- Score on 15 / 04 / 07 in Super League XII: 52 - 22. This matches the claim.
- Attendance on that date: 10,881. This contradicts the claimed attendance of 9,000.

Conclusion:
The score component of the claim is correct, but the attendance is not. The actual attendance recorded for that match was 10,881, not 9,000.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "15 / 04 / 07" as a date string stored exactly in the dataset (day/month/year) for the 2007 season.
- Interpreted "super league xii" as the 2007 Super League season value stored in lowercase in the competition column.
- Interpreted "52 to 22" as equivalent to the stored score format "52 - 22".
