Summary
- Claim: "only 1 of the viral disease have be assign to a family"
- Finding: The data shows 22 viral diseases are assigned to a specific family and 1 is labeled as "unassigned." Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns:
  - family (text, not null)
  - baltimore group (text, not null)
  - envelopment (text, not null)
  - virion shape (text, not null)
  - replication site (text, not null)
- Keys: none

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Total number of viral disease records
- Result: 23
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM public.viral_disease;

2) Records with a non-empty family value (after trimming)
- Result: 23
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.viral_disease WHERE trim(family) <> '';

3) Distinct non-empty family values
- Result: 23
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT trim(family)) FROM public.viral_disease WHERE trim(family) <> '';

4) Family distribution (to inspect whether any records are unassigned)
- Result excerpt (each has count 1): adenoviridae, arenaviridae, astroviridae, bunyaviridae, caliciviridae, coronaviridae, filoviridae, flaviviridae, hepadnaviridae, hepeviridae, herpesviridae, orthomyxoviridae, papillomaviridae, paramyxoviridae, parvoviridae, picornaviridae, polyomaviridae, poxviridae, reoviridae, retroviridae, rhabdoviridae, togaviridae, unassigned
- SQL: SELECT family, COUNT(*) AS record_count FROM public.viral_disease GROUP BY family ORDER BY family;

5) Assigned vs. unassigned counts
- Records with family = 'unassigned': 1
- Records with family <> 'unassigned': 22
- Total rows: 23
- SQL (unassigned count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS unassigned_count FROM viral_disease WHERE family = 'unassigned';
- SQL (assigned count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS assigned_count FROM viral_disease WHERE family <> 'unassigned';
- SQL (total): SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM viral_disease;

Conclusion
- The statement "only 1 of the viral disease have be assign to a family" is contradicted by the data. In fact, 22 of 23 records have a specific family assigned, and 1 record is explicitly labeled "unassigned."

Assumptions
- Interpreted "assigned to a family" as having a specific, non-placeholder family value; the value "unassigned" was treated as not assigned. All other non-empty family names were treated as assigned.
