Claim to verify: “5 of the game list end with 0 - 0 result and 3 with a result of 5 - 0.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season (game bigint, date text, opponent text, venue text, result text, attendance bigint)
- This table contains the list of matches for Bradford City A.F.C. in the 2008–09 season, including a text “result” field.

Evidence gathered
1) Distinct results and their counts
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT result, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season
  GROUP BY result
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Key outputs from this query:
  • 0 - 0: 5 times
  • 5 - 0: 1 time
  (Additional context from the same query: 2 - 0: 6; 1 - 1: 5; 0 - 1: 4; 1 - 0: 3; 1 - 2: 3; 1 - 3: 2; 1 - 4: 2; 3 - 2: 2; 3 - 3: 2; 4 - 0: 1; 0 - 3: 1; 2 - 3: 1; 3 - 1: 1; 2 - 1: 1; 2 - 2: 1; 0 - 2: 1; 4 - 1: 1)

2) Direct count of 0 - 0 results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '0 - 0';
- Result: 5 games

3) Direct count of 5 - 0 results
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season WHERE result = '5 - 0';
- Result: 1 game

Conclusion
- The claim is partly correct and partly incorrect based on the Bradford City A.F.C. 2008–09 season data:
  • “5 end with 0 - 0” is supported (5 matches).
  • “3 with 5 - 0” is contradicted by the data (only 1 match).

Assumptions made
- “the game list” refers to all matches recorded in the table public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season for the 2008–09 season, and the result formatting is exactly as stored (e.g., '0 - 0', '5 - 0').
