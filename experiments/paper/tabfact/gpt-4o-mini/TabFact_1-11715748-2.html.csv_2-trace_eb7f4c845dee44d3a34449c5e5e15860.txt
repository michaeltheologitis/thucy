Claim to verify: “Interior Loft [was] directed by Ken Wiederhorn and originally aired on January 22, 1990.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes (episodes of Freddy’s Nightmares).
- Schema details (relevant columns): series (bigint), season (bigint), title (text), director (s) (text), writer (s) (text), original airdate (text).

Evidence query and results:
1) Purpose: Locate any episode titled “Interior Loft” (or similar) and check director and original airdate.
Executed SQL:
SELECT series, season, title, "director (s)", "original airdate" 
FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes 
WHERE title ILIKE '%Interior%' AND title ILIKE '%Loft%'

Results returned by the database:
- Episode Title: Interior Loft; Series: 37; Season: 15; Director(s): Ken Wiederhorn; Original Airdate: January 22, 1990
- Episode Title: Interior Loft Later; Series: 38; Season: 16; Director(s): Ken Wiederhorn; Original Airdate: January 29, 1990

Assessment:
- The record for the episode titled “Interior Loft” explicitly lists Ken Wiederhorn as the director and the original airdate as January 22, 1990. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Freddy’s Nightmares episode titled “Interior Loft.”
- “Originally air” is interpreted as the original airdate listed in the dataset.
