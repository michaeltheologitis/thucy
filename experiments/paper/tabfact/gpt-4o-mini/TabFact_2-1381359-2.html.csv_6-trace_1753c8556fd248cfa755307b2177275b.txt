Claim to verify: “Tenri be the winner in the game that have Teikyo as the runner-up.”

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table: all_japan_university_rugby_championship

Table schema inspected
- Columns: title (text), season (text), winner (text), score (text), runner - up (text), venue (text), attendance (text)
- Note: The runner-up column is named exactly "runner - up" (with spaces and hyphen) and must be double-quoted in SQL.

Evidence gathered
1) Check if Tenri ever appears as a winner
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue 
  FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
  WHERE winner ILIKE '%Tenri%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: There are no entries where the winner contains “Tenri”.

2) Check cases where Teikyo is the runner-up
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue 
  FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
  WHERE "runner - up" ILIKE '%Teikyo%';
- Result:
  season: 2008 - 9 details | winner: waseda | score: 20 - 10 | runner - up: teikyo | venue: national stadium , tokyo , tokyo
- Interpretation: In 2008–09, Teikyo was runner-up, but the winner was Waseda, not Tenri.

3) Check all rows involving Teikyo (either as winner or runner-up) to see if any match Tenri as the winner and Teikyo as runner-up
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue 
  FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
  WHERE winner ILIKE '%Teikyo%' OR "runner - up" ILIKE '%Teikyo%'
  ORDER BY season;
- Result rows:
  - 2008 - 9 details | Winner: Waseda | Score: 20 - 10 | Runner-Up: Teikyo | Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo, Tokyo
  - 2009 - 10 details | Winner: Teikyo | Score: 14 - 13 | Runner-Up: Tokai | Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo, Tokyo
  - 2010 - 11 details | Winner: Teikyo | Score: 17 - 14 | Runner-Up: Waseda | Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo, Tokyo
  - 2011 - 12 details | Winner: Teikyo | Score: 15 - 12 | Runner-Up: Tenri | Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo, Tokyo
  - 2012 - 13 details | Winner: Teikyo | Score: 39 - 22 | Runner-Up: Tsukuba | Venue: National Stadium, Tokyo, Tokyo
- Interpretation: The only row involving both Tenri and Teikyo shows Teikyo as winner and Tenri as runner-up (2011–12), not the reverse.

4) Confirm Tenri appears as runner-up (to verify presence in dataset)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, winner, score, "runner - up", venue 
  FROM all_japan_university_rugby_championship 
  WHERE "runner - up" ILIKE '%Tenri%';
- Result:
  season: 2011 - 12 details | winner: Teikyo | score: 15 - 12 | runner - up: tenri | venue: national stadium, tokyo, tokyo
- Interpretation: Confirms Tenri was runner-up to Teikyo in 2011–12.

Conclusion
- The database contains no instance where Tenri is the winner and Teikyo is the runner-up. Instead, in 2011–12, Teikyo defeated Tenri (Tenri was the runner-up). In 2008–09 Teikyo was runner-up, but the winner was Waseda, not Tenri. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Game” is interpreted as the All-Japan University Rugby Championship final (the scope of the available dataset).
- “Tenri” and “Teikyo” refer to university teams as recorded in the all_japan_university_rugby_championship table.
