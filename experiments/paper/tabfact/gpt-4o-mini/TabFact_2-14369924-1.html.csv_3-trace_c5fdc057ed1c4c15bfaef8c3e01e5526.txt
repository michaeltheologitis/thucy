Claim to verify: The ERP (in watts) and the class for W230AV (Gadsden, Alabama) are the same as for W269AX (Anniston, Alabama).

Data source explored:
- Database: Postgres (default)
- Schema: public
- Table: wyfk
- Columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (text), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text)

Evidence-gathering steps and executed SQL:
1) Search for the two call signs and cities to retrieve ERP and class values
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "erp w", "class", "frequency mhz"
FROM public.wyfk
WHERE ("city of license" ILIKE '%Gadsden%' OR "city of license" ILIKE '%Anniston%')
   OR ("call sign" ILIKE 'W230%' OR "call sign" ILIKE 'W269%');

Results returned from this query:
- Call Sign: W230AV; City of License: Gadsden, Alabama; ERP W: 10; Class: D; Frequency MHz: 93.9 FM
- Call Sign: W269AX; City of License: Anniston, Alabama; ERP W: 10; Class: D; Frequency MHz: 101.7 FM

Conclusion based on data:
- W230AV (Gadsden, AL) has ERP 10 W and Class D.
- W269AX (Anniston, AL) has ERP 10 W and Class D.
- Therefore, both stations have the same ERP (10 W) and the same class (D).

Assumptions:
- "erp w" represents effective radiated power in watts, and "class" reflects the FCC station class as stored in this dataset.
- Matching on city substrings (Gadsden, Anniston) is sufficient to identify the intended records.
