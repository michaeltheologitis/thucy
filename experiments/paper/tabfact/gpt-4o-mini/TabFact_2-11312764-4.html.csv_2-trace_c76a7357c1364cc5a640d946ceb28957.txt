Claim to verify: “Linda Fratianne was the winner and Anett Pötzsch was ranked second place in the 1979 World Figure Skating Championship.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships.
- Schema (from data source): columns include rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), "sp + fs" (bigint), points (double precision), places (bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Direct lookup of the two athletes
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE 'Linda Fratianne' OR name ILIKE 'Anett Pötzsch' OR name ILIKE 'Anett Poetzsch';

Result returned by the database tool:
- Linda Fratianne — Rank: 1 — Nation: United States
- Anett Pötzsch — Rank: 2 — Nation: East Germany

2) Context: top 10 by rank from the same table
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation 
FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships 
ORDER BY rank 
LIMIT 10;

Result returned by the database tool (first 10 rows):
1) Rank 1 — Linda Fratianne — United States
2) Rank 2 — Anett Pötzsch — East Germany
3) Rank 3 — Emi Watanabe — Japan
4) Rank 4 — Dagmar Lurz — West Germany
5) Rank 5 — Denise Biellmann — Switzerland
6) Rank 6 — Lisa - Marie Allen — United States
7) Rank 7 — Claudia Kristofics - Binder — Austria
8) Rank 8 — Susanna Driano — Italy
9) Rank 9 — Carola Weißenberg — East Germany
10) Rank 10 — Kristiina Wegelius — Finland

Assessment
- The data shows Linda Fratianne is ranked 1st and Anett Pötzsch is ranked 2nd in the table of 1979 World Figure Skating Championships results. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the database evidence.

Assumptions made
- The table public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships represents the Ladies’ singles results for the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. “Winner” is interpreted as rank 1, and “rank in second place” as rank 2.
