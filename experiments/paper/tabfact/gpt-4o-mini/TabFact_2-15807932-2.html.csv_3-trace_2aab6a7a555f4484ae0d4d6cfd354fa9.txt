Claim assessed: "south korea get 2 gold award in total"

Data environment explored
- Available authoritative source: a PostgreSQL database for the 1967 World Judo Championships containing table public.t_1967_world_judo_championships with columns: rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total.

Evidence gathered
1) Query to find any nation containing "Korea" and its medal counts
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total 
FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships 
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Korea%';
Result:
- Nation: South Korea | Gold: 0 | Silver: 1 | Bronze: 2 | Total: 3

2) Full medal table (context)
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, nation, gold, silver, bronze, total FROM public.t_1967_world_judo_championships ORDER BY rank;
Key row of interest:
- Rank: 3 | Nation: South Korea | Gold: 0 | Silver: 1 | Bronze: 2 | Total: 3

Conclusion
- Within the available authoritative dataset (1967 World Judo Championships), South Korea did not win 2 gold awards; they won 0 gold. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "gold award" as "gold medals" and the claim as referring to the 1967 World Judo Championships because this is the only available data source. If the claim intended a different event or time span, that data is not present in the accessible sources.
