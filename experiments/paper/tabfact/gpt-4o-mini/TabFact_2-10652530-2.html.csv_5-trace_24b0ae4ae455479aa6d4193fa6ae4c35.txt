Summary conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. On October 17, 2004, the Cleveland Browns played the Cincinnati Bengals with an attendance of 73,263. The Browns’ game against the San Diego Chargers occurred on December 19, 2004, with an attendance of 72,489.

Data source explored:
- PostgreSQL database (TabFact), public schema
- Table: public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), stadium (text), record (text), attendance (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Listing all games to identify the Oct 17 entry and its opponent and attendance
SQL: SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season ORDER BY week;
Key relevant rows from the results:
- October 17, 2004 | Cincinnati Bengals | 73,263
- December 19, 2004 | San Diego Chargers | 72,489

2) Verifying there is no game on October 17, 2004 against San Diego
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season WHERE date = 'October 17, 2004' AND opponent ILIKE '%San Diego%';
Result: 0
SQL: SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season WHERE date = 'October 17, 2004' AND opponent ILIKE '%San Diego%';
Result: No matching rows

3) Retrieving the game(s) against San Diego to confirm date and attendance
SQL: SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_2004_cleveland_browns_season WHERE opponent ILIKE '%San Diego%';
Result: December 19, 2004 | 72,489

Assessment:
- The attendance figure 73,263 corresponds to the Browns’ October 17, 2004 game, but the opponent was the Cincinnati Bengals, not the San Diego Chargers.
- The San Diego Chargers game occurred on December 19, 2004, with attendance 72,489.

Final determination: The specific claim tying October 17, 2004 to a game against the San Diego Chargers with 73,263 attendance is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- "san diego charger" refers to the NFL team San Diego Chargers (now Los Angeles Chargers).
- The claim pertains to the Cleveland Browns’ 2004 season, matching the available dataset.
