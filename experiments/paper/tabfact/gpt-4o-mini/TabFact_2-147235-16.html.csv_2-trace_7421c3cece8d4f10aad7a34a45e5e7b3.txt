Claim: “斤 and 担 / 擔 both have a relative value that’s at least 1.”

Result: Supported by the database of Chinese units of measurement.

Evidence from data
- Retrieved fields: character, relative value, metric value from table public.chinese_units_of_measurement for the characters 斤, 担, 擔 (including entries that contain these characters).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT character, "relative value", "metric value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE character IN ('斤', '担', '擔') 
OR character LIKE '%斤%' 
OR character LIKE '%担%' 
OR character LIKE '%擔%' ;

Query results (relevant rows):
- Character: 斤
  - Relative Value: 1
  - Metric Value: 604.78982 g
- Character: 担 / 擔
  - Relative Value: 100
  - Metric Value: 60.478982 kg

Assessment of each part of the claim
- 斤: relative value = 1 → meets “at least 1”.
- 担 / 擔: relative value = 100 → meets “at least 1”.

Conclusion: Both specified units have relative values ≥ 1 in the dataset.

Assumptions
- “Relative value” refers to the column named "relative value" in the chinese_units_of_measurement table, representing a unit’s value relative to the base unit used in the dataset (which, by the data, treats 斤 as the base unit with value 1).
