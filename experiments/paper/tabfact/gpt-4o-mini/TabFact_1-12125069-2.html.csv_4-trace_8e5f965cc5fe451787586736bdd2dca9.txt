Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and relevant table containing the 2005 Texas Rangers season game logs.
- Inspected the table’s columns and retrieved sample rows that include games around late June, providing direct evidence for June 24 and June 25.
- Assessed whether Chris Young was the winning pitcher on June 24 based on the returned records.

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2005_texas_rangers_season (Texas Rangers 2005 season game logs)

Schema inspection (executed SQL and results)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2005_texas_rangers_season';
- Returned columns:
  1) attendance
  2) winning team
  3) score
  4) date
  5) losing pitcher
  6) location
  7) winning pitcher

Evidence from the game log (executed SQL and results)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 5;
- Returned sample rows (as provided by the query engine):
  1) Date: May 20, Location: Arlington, Winning Team: Texas, Score: 7 - 3, Winning Pitcher: Kenny Rogers, Losing Pitcher: Brandon Backe, Attendance: 38,109
  2) Date: May 21, Location: Arlington, Winning Team: Texas, Score: 18 - 3, Winning Pitcher: Chris Young, Losing Pitcher: Ezequiel Astacio, Attendance: 35,781
  3) Date: May 22, Location: Arlington, Winning Team: Texas, Score: 2 - 0, Winning Pitcher: Chan Ho Park, Losing Pitcher: Roy Oswalt, Attendance: 40,583
  4) Date: June 24, Location: Houston, Winning Team: Houston, Score: 5 - 2, Winning Pitcher: Roy Oswalt, Losing Pitcher: Ricardo Rodríguez, Attendance: 36,199
  5) Date: June 25, Location: Houston, Winning Team: Texas, Score: 6 - 5, Winning Pitcher: Chris Young, Losing Pitcher: Brandon Backe, Attendance: 41,868

Analysis
- The June 24 entry clearly lists Roy Oswalt as the winning pitcher, not Chris Young.
- Chris Young appears as the winning pitcher on June 25, not June 24, in this dataset for the 2005 Texas Rangers season.

Conclusion
- Based on the table entries shown by the executed SQL queries, the claim that the winning pitcher on June 24 was Chris Young is contradicted. The winning pitcher on June 24 (in the 2005 Texas Rangers season log) was Roy Oswalt.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to June 24 of the 2005 Texas Rangers season (the only accessible dataset). If a different year/team/date context was intended, it is not available in the current data environment.
