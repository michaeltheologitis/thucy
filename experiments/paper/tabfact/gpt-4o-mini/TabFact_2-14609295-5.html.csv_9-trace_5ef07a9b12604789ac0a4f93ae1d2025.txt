Claim interpreted: “In 1996 they were the 2 seed of the Southeast region.” I interpret “they” as the VCU Rams men’s basketball team, given the available data source centers on VCU.

Data source discovery:
- Database: public schema
- Table: vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (columns: year, record, seed, region, results)

Evidence query and results:
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball WHERE year = 1996;

- Result:
year: 1996
record: 24 - 9
seed: 12
region: southeast
results: l 51 - 58

Analysis:
- The data shows VCU’s NCAA tournament seed in 1996 was 12 in the Southeast region—not a 2 seed. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “They” refers to the VCU Rams men’s basketball team.
- “1996” refers to the 1996 NCAA men’s basketball tournament season.
