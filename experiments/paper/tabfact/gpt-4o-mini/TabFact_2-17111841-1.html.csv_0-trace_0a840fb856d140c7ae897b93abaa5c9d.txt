Objective
Verify whether episode 4 is the earliest episode number that originally aired on June 8, 2008.

Data Source Exploration
- Discovered database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), original airdate (text), timeslot (approx) (text), viewers (millions) (double precision), nightly rank (bigint)

Evidence and Queries
1) Identify available airdates and counts (to confirm if “8 June 2008” exists and whether multiple episodes share that date):
SQL:
SELECT "original airdate", COUNT("episode") AS episode_count
FROM my_info_table
GROUP BY "original airdate"
ORDER BY "original airdate";
Result excerpt:
- 8 June 2008 | 1
(Each date appears once, including 8 June 2008.)

2) Retrieve the episode(s) that aired on 8 June 2008 and find the minimum episode number for that date:
SQL:
SELECT episode, "original airdate" FROM my_info_table WHERE "original airdate" ILIKE '%8 June 2008%';
Result:
- Episode: 4 | Original Airdate: 8 june 2008

Conclusion
- There is exactly one episode with original airdate "8 June 2008", and its episode number is 4. Therefore, episode 4 is the earliest episode number that originally aired on June 8, 2008.

Assumptions
- “Earliest episode number” is interpreted as the minimum episode number among entries with original airdate June 8, 2008.
- The dataset represents a single series’ episode list; no cross-series comparison is intended.
- Matching uses the text-formatted date value present in the data ("8 June 2008").
