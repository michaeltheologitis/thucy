Claim assessed: “the player in second place be from south africa.”

Finding: The data shows the player in second place is Jim Colbert, whose country is listed as United States, not South Africa.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Context of top finishers
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par" 
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf 
  ORDER BY place 
  LIMIT 10;
- Returned excerpt:
  - Place: 1 | Player: Gary Player | Country: South Africa | Score: 67 + 70 = 137 | To Par: -5
  - Place: 2 | Player: Jim Colbert | Country: United States | Score: 70 + 68 = 138 | To Par: -4
  - Place: t3 | Player: Jack Nicklaus | Country: United States | Score: 71 + 69 = 140 | To Par: -2
  - Place: t3 | Player: Johnny Miller | Country: United States | Score: 71 + 69 = 140 | To Par: -2
  - Place: t3 | Player: Bob Charles | Country: New Zealand | Score: 71 + 69 = 140 | To Par: -2

2) Direct check for second place (including ties)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country, score, "to par"
  FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE place LIKE '2%';
- Returned rows:
  - Place: 2 | Player: Jim Colbert | Country: United States | Score: 70 + 68 = 138 | To Par: -4

Conclusion: The second-place finisher is from the United States, not South Africa. While a South African player (Gary Player) appears in the data, he is listed as the winner (first place), not second place.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “the player in second place” as the second-place finisher in the available 1973 U.S. Open golf dataset (table public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf).
- Considered both outright and tied second places; the data shows an outright second place (no T2 row).
