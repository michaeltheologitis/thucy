Summary of approach
- Explored the available database and its schema.
- Queried for entries related to “2014 world cup qualification” to verify whether any recorded score is 2 - 1.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: public.kwak_tae_hwi
- Table columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Context scan for World Cup-related entries (limit 50)
SQL:
SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result 
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi 
WHERE competition ILIKE '%World Cup qualification%' OR competition ILIKE '%2014%' 
LIMIT 50;

Result rows of interest:
- Date: June 8, 2012; Competition: 2014 world cup qualification; Venue: Doha, Qatar; Score: 2 - 1; Result: 4 - 1

2) Exact match on competition = '2014 world cup qualification' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT date, venue, score, result FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE LOWER(competition) = LOWER('2014 world cup qualification');

Result:
- Date: June 8, 2012; Venue: Doha, Qatar; Score: 2 - 1; Result: 4 - 1

Analysis
- The dataset contains an entry labeled “2014 world cup qualification” with a score recorded as “2 - 1” on June 8, 2012 in Doha, Qatar. This supports the existence of at least one 2014 World Cup qualification match with a 2-1 score in the available data.
- Note that “the 2014 World Cup qualification” is not a single match but a multi-match process across confederations; there is no singular overall score. The claim, as phrased, is ambiguous if it implies a single definitive score for the entire qualification. Within this dataset, however, the only exact match for that competition label has score 2 - 1.

Conclusion
- The data supports that there is a 2014 World Cup qualification match with a score of 2 - 1 in the available table.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a specific match labeled “2014 world cup qualification” within the available dataset, rather than implying a single aggregate score for the entire qualification cycle.
- Treated the public.kwak_tae_hwi table as the authoritative source for this verification.
