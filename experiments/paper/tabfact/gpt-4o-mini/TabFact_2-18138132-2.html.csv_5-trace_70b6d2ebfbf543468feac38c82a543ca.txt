Claim to verify: "babaroga be the developer with a release date of 2010 - 12 - 16 and the title of facebook"

Findings from the available data source (public.list_of_zune_applications):

1) Existence and details of a "facebook" title
- Result: A record exists for the title "facebook" with developer "matchbox" and release date "2010 - 12 - 16".
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, "release date" FROM public.list_of_zune_applications WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('Facebook');
- Returned row:
  • title: facebook
  • developer: matchbox
  • release date: 2010 - 12 - 16

2) Entries where the developer is "babaroga"
- Result: The database shows at least one title by "babaroga", but it is not "facebook" and has a different release date.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT title, developer, "release date" FROM list_of_zune_applications WHERE developer = 'babaroga';
- Returned row(s):
  • title: fingerpaint; developer: babaroga; release date: 2011 - 07 - 29

3) Direct check for a "facebook" title by "babaroga"
- Result: No such row exists (case-insensitive check).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS app_count 
FROM public.list_of_zune_applications 
WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('Facebook') AND LOWER(developer) = LOWER('babaroga');
- Returned value: 0

Conclusion:
- The title "facebook" with release date "2010 - 12 - 16" exists, but the developer in the database is "matchbox", not "babaroga". Therefore, the claim incorrectly attributes the developer.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Zune applications dataset available to us, specifically an application titled "facebook".
- Treated the textual date format "2010 - 12 - 16" as the intended date for comparison with the claim "2010 - 12 - 16".
