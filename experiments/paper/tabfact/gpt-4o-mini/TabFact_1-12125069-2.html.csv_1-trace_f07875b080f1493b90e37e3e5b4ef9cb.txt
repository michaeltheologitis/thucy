Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single relevant table containing Texas Rangers season games data.
- Reviewed the table structure to understand available fields and date formatting.
- Queried the dataset to determine how many games occurred on “may 20” and retrieved details for that date.

Data source and schema
- Database: Postgres
- Table: public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season
- Columns: date (text), winning team (text), score (text), winning pitcher (text), losing pitcher (text), attendance (bigint), location (text)

Evidence
1) Inspect date values to understand format
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 20;
Result (examples): may 21, may 22, june 25, may 20, june 24
Interpretation: The date column stores month/day as lowercase text without a year (e.g., "may 20").

2) Count games on "may 20"
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE date = 'may 20';
Result: game_count = 1

3) Retrieve details for the game(s) on "may 20"
SQL:
SELECT date, location, score, "winning team" 
FROM public.t_2005_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE date = 'may 20';
Result: date = may 20; location = Arlington; score = 7 - 3; winning team = Texas

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly 1 game on “may 20.”

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (Texas Rangers season data) and its date representation (lowercase month/day without year).
