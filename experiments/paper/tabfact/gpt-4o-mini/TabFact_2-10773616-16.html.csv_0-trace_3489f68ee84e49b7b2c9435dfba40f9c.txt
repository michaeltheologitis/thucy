Claim interpreted: In the available 1954 VFL season dataset, Collingwood do not have a maximum home team score higher than Geelong’s maximum home team score.

Data source discovery:
- Available table: public.t_1954_vfl_season
- Relevant columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)

Score format check:
- Example rows show scores like "12.16 (88)", indicating total points are inside parentheses.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Sample of score format
SQL:
SELECT "home team score", "away team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt): entries like 13.12 (90), 12.16 (88), etc., confirming the total points are the numbers in parentheses.

2) Collingwood home entries
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE lower("home team") LIKE '%colling%';
Result: Collingwood home game example with score 12.16 (88).

3) Collingwood maximum home points
SQL:
SELECT MAX( CAST( regexp_replace("home team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\1') AS INT ) ) AS max_coll_home_points
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") LIKE '%colling%';
Result: 88

4) Geelong home entries
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season WHERE lower("home team") LIKE '%geelong%';
Result: Geelong home game example with score 13.12 (90).

5) Geelong maximum home points
SQL:
SELECT MAX( CAST( regexp_replace("home team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\1') AS INT ) ) AS max_geel_home_points
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") LIKE '%geelong%';
Result: 90

6) Combined comparison query
SQL:
WITH scores AS (
  SELECT "home team" AS team,
         CAST(regexp_replace("home team score", '.*\((\d+)\).*', '\1') AS INT) AS points
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
  WHERE lower("home team") IN ('collingwood','geelong')
)
SELECT team, MAX(points) AS max_home_points
FROM scores
GROUP BY team
ORDER BY team;
Result: Collingwood = 88, Geelong = 90

Conclusion:
- Collingwood’s maximum home team score is 88.
- Geelong’s maximum home team score is 90.
- Therefore, Collingwood do not have a home team score higher than Geelong’s.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the dataset at hand (the 1954 VFL season) and compares each team’s maximum home total points, which are the numbers inside parentheses in the score fields.
