Claim interpreted: Did Triston Grant play the same position as the other player drafted by the Flyers in his round?

Data source discovery and schema
- SQL (list tables):
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result: t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season

- SQL (list columns):
  SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result (for t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season):
  - round: bigint
  - player: text
  - position: text
  - nationality: text
  - college / junior / club team (league): text

Evidence
1) Identify Triston Grant’s round and position
- SQL:
  SELECT player, round, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE player ILIKE '%Triston Grant%';
  Result:
  - Triston Grant | round: 9 | position: Left Wing

2) List all players drafted in the same round as Triston Grant (round 9) and their positions
- SQL:
  SELECT player, position FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 9;
  Results:
  - Triston Grant — Left Wing
  - John Carter — Center

3) Check if positions are the same within round 9
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT position) AS distinct_positions_in_round9 FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season WHERE round = 9;
  Result: 2 distinct positions

Conclusion
- Triston Grant (Left Wing) did not play the same position as the other player drafted in his round (John Carter, Center). The data show two distinct positions among round 9 picks.

Assumptions
- “Other player drafted in his round” refers to other Philadelphia Flyers pick(s) recorded in the same draft round within the table t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season.
- Player name matched using case-insensitive substring search to account for potential formatting differences.
