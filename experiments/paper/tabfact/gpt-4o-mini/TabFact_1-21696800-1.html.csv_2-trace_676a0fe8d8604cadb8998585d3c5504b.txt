Data sources checked:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.smallville_season_9 (Smallville Season 9 episode data).

Relevant schema (public.smallville_season_9):
- Columns include: no (bigint), - (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), us air date (text), production code (text), us viewers (million) (double precision). No primary keys.

Verification steps and evidence:
1) Count how many rows list Wayne Rose as the director (case-insensitive).
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS director_count FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE 'Wayne Rose';
Result: 1

2) Retrieve the titles for rows directed by Wayne Rose.
SQL:
SELECT title FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE 'Wayne Rose';
Result: echo

Conclusion:
- Wayne Rose appears exactly once as a director in the table, and the associated title is "echo".

Assumptions:
- Interpreted "direct" as "directed by".
- Interpreted "title echo" as the episode title equals "echo" (case-insensitive).
- "only 1" refers to the count of rows in this specific table where the director is Wayne Rose.
