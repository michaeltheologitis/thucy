Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as: “For the name with the highest total and the name with the lowest total, their ‘last’ record date is in May.”

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_sumo_record_holders (columns: name text, total bigint, first text, last text, highest rank text)

Step 1: Confirm that the `last` field contains month names
Evidence (Sample of the date format in first/last)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT first, last FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders LIMIT 10;
- Result (excerpt shown by tool): months such as “may 1994”, “september 1999”, etc., confirming that ‘last’ includes a month and year.

Step 2: Identify the highest and lowest totals
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(total) AS max_total, MIN(total) AS min_total FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders;
- Result:
  - Maximum total: 34
  - Minimum total: 22

Step 3: Retrieve all rows at these extremes and check whether ‘last’ is in May
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, total, last FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders) OR total = (SELECT MIN(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders);
- Result rows (as returned by tool):
  - Max: kotonishiki | 34 | september 1999
  - Min: daikirin | 22 | september 1970
  - Min: kisenosato | 22 | september 2011
  - Min: tochiazuma ii | 22 | january 2005

- Executed SQL (with explicit May check):
SELECT name, total, last,
CASE
    WHEN total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders) THEN 'max'
    WHEN total = (SELECT MIN(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders) THEN 'min'
END AS which_extreme,
EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(last, 'Month YYYY')) = 5 AS is_last_may
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
WHERE total = (SELECT MAX(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders) OR total = (SELECT MIN(total) FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders)
ORDER BY which_extreme, name;
- Result (as returned by tool):
  - max | kotonishiki | 34 | september 1999 | is_last_may = false
  - min | daikirin | 22 | september 1970 | is_last_may = false
  - min | kisenosato | 22 | september 2011 | is_last_may = false
  - min | tochiazuma ii | 22 | january 2005 | is_last_may = false

Additional confirmation via separate highest/lowest single-row queries
- Executed SQL (highest):
SELECT 'highest' AS role, name, total, last,
       CASE WHEN LOWER(last) LIKE '%may%' THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS is_last_may
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
ORDER BY total DESC, name
LIMIT 1;
- Result: highest | kotonishiki | 34 | september 1999 | is_last_may = false

- Executed SQL (lowest):
SELECT 'lowest' AS role, name, total, last,
       CASE WHEN LOWER(last) LIKE '%may%' THEN TRUE ELSE FALSE END AS is_last_may
FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
ORDER BY total ASC, name
LIMIT 1;
- Result: lowest | daikirin | 22 | september 1970 | is_last_may = false

Conclusion
- For the highest total (kotonishiki, 34), the last record month is September, not May.
- For the lowest total(s) (22), all tied names have last months of September or January, not May.
- Therefore, the claim that the last record for both the highest- and lowest-total names is in May is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Last record” refers to the ‘last’ column in the table, which contains a textual month and year.
- Where the claim implies single names for highest/lowest totals, ties were inspected; no tied ‘last’ month equals May.
