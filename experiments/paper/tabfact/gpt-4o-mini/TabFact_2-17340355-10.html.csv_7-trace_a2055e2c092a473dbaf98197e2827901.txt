Claim to verify: “the game at the fedexforum take place after the game at the target center.”

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact-derived PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season (2008–09 Phoenix Suns season)
- Relevant columns: game (bigint, season order), date (text), team (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence 1: Directly locate games by venue names and check order
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%FedExForum%' OR "location attendance" ILIKE '%Target Center%' ORDER BY game;
- Result returned by the data tool:
  • Game 79 — Date: April 10 — Team: Memphis — Location Attendance: FedExForum (15,908 attendees)
  • Game 80 — Date: April 11 — Team: Minnesota — Location Attendance: Target Center (18,478 attendees)

Evidence 2: Cross-check via opponent names (Memphis/Minnesota) and venues
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, "location attendance" 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
  WHERE team ILIKE '%Memphis%' OR team ILIKE '%Minnesota%'
  ORDER BY game;
- Result returned by the data tool:
  • Game 79 — Date: April 10 — Team: Memphis — Location Attendance: FedExForum 15908
  • Game 80 — Date: April 11 — Team: Minnesota — Location Attendance: Target Center 18478
  • Game 81 — Date: April 13 — Team: Memphis — Location Attendance: US Airways Center 18422

Analysis:
- Both queries show that the Suns’ game at FedExForum (Game 79 on April 10) occurred before the game at Target Center (Game 80 on April 11).
- Therefore, the statement that the game at FedExForum took place after the game at Target Center is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion:
- The data clearly indicates FedExForum (Apr 10, Game 79) preceded Target Center (Apr 11, Game 80).

Assumptions:
- “The game at the fedexforum” and “the game at the target center” refer to the Phoenix Suns’ away games at those venues during the 2008–09 season, as captured in the provided table. The game column reflects chronological season order.
