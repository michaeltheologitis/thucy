Claim interpreted: Determine whether UAB is the opponent when East Carolina (ECU) plays at the "Legion Field, Birmingham, AL" site (within the available 1990–1999 ECU football dataset).

What the data shows:
- The dataset contains one ECU game at Legion Field, Birmingham, AL, and the opponent is Alabama, not UAB.
- The dataset contains no ECU games against UAB at all.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Find any ECU games at Legion Field
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE site ILIKE '%Legion Field%'
- Result:
  Date: October 17; Opponent: Alabama; Site: Legion Field, Birmingham, AL; Result: L 22 - 23; Attendance: 80,079

2) Cross-check for any mention of Legion/Birmingham variations
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE site ILIKE '%Legion%' OR site ILIKE '%Birmingham%';
- Result:
  Date: October 17; Opponent: Alabama; Site: Legion Field, Birmingham, AL; Result: L 22 - 23; Attendance: 80,079

3) Check for any ECU games vs UAB in the table
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE '%UAB%';
- Result:
  No rows returned.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available 1990–1999 ECU football data, when ECU played at Legion Field (Birmingham, AL), the opponent was Alabama, not UAB. There are no records of ECU playing UAB in this dataset.

Assumptions made:
- "They" refers to East Carolina University (ECU) football, as the only accessible dataset is for ECU (1990–1999).
- Verification is limited to the authoritative dataset provided (1990–1999 ECU games).
