Summary of data exploration
- Discovered available data: Database TabFact, schema public, table my_info_table with columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text).

Evidence query and results
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE record = '12 - 38 - 13' OR record = '12-38-13' OR record = '12 -38 - 13' OR record = '12-38- 13' OR record = '12- 38-13' OR record = '12- 38 - 13'

- Result returned by the query:
  Date: February 26
  Visitor: New Jersey
  Home: Pittsburgh
  Score: 4 - 5
  Record: 12 - 38 - 13

Conclusion
- The claim that the score of the game with a 12 - 38 - 13 record is 2 - 6 is contradicted by the data. The recorded score for that game is 4 - 5.

Assumptions
- “Record” in the user’s claim corresponds to the record field in my_info_table.
- “Score” refers to the score field in my_info_table for the identified row(s).
