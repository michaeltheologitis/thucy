Claim to verify: “there be more brm then any other with alfa romeo and matra tying for the least”

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (1971 South African Grand Prix data).

Table structure and size (evidence)
- Row count
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
  Result: 25 rows

- Columns
  SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='t_1971_south_african_grand_prix' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
  Result:
  - driver (text)
  - constructor (text)
  - laps (bigint)
  - time / retired (text)
  - grid (bigint)

Constructor frequency (evidence)
- Counts per constructor (sorted by count desc)
  SQL: SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix GROUP BY constructor ORDER BY cnt DESC;
  Results:
  - march - ford: 4
  - brabham - ford: 3
  - ferrari: 3
  - mclaren - ford: 3
  - brm: 3
  - surtees - ford: 3
  - lotus - ford: 2
  - tyrrell - ford: 2
  - march - alfa romeo: 1
  - matra: 1

- Distinct constructors with counts (alphabetical check)
  SQL: SELECT constructor, COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix GROUP BY constructor ORDER BY constructor ASC;
  Results:
  - brabham - ford: 3
  - brm: 3
  - ferrari: 3
  - lotus - ford: 2
  - march - alfa romeo: 1
  - march - ford: 4
  - matra: 1
  - mclaren - ford: 3
  - surtees - ford: 3
  - tyrrell - ford: 2

Findings
- “more brm than any other”: Not supported. The most frequent constructor is “march - ford” with 4 entries. “brm” has 3 entries, tied with several others (brabham - ford, ferrari, mclaren - ford, surtees - ford).
- “alfa romeo and matra tying for the least”: Supported. The least frequent constructors have 1 entry each: “march - alfa romeo” and “matra”.

Conclusion
- The claim is mixed: the part about BRM is incorrect, while the part about Alfa Romeo and Matra tying for the fewest is correct according to this dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “BRM,” “Alfa Romeo,” and “Matra” using the table’s constructor field values. “Alfa Romeo” appears as part of the combined constructor string “march - alfa romeo,” which is treated as the constructor identifier in this dataset.
