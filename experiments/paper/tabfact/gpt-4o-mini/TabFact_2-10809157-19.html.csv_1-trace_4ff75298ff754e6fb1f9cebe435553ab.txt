Claim assessed: “Carlton score 20.7 when they play Richmond at prince park.”

Evidence from available data (1969 VFL season):
- We queried all 1969 matches played at venues containing “Princes” and found a Carlton vs Richmond match at Princes Park where Carlton’s score was 20.7 (127).

Result returned by the database:
- Date: 23 August 1969
- Venue: Princes Park
- Home Team: Carlton
- Away Team: Richmond
- Home Team Score: 20.7 (127)
- Away Team Score: 24.12 (156)

Executed SQL (evidence):
SELECT date, venue, "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score" 
FROM public.t_1969_vfl_season 
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Princes%' AND date::date BETWEEN '1969-01-01' AND '1969-12-31';

Assessment:
- This directly supports the claim in the context of the accessible dataset (1969 VFL season). The venue is recorded as “Princes Park” (commonly known), and Carlton indeed scored 20.7 against Richmond there on 23 Aug 1969.

Assumptions noted:
- The verification is grounded in the available 1969 VFL season data only. The claim lacks a date; I interpret it as referring to the 1969 match at Princes Park found in this dataset. The venue name is “Princes Park” (not “prince park”), treated as a spelling variation in the claim.
