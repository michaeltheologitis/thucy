Claim to verify: "fitzroy have a higher score than any of the other team"

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database with historical sports data: table public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL season)
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), "venue" (text), "crowd" (bigint), "date" (text)
  - Scores are stored as text in AFL format like "goals.behinds (total)", e.g., "13.17 (95)". The integer inside parentheses is the total points.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm Fitzroy is in the dataset
- SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" AS team FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT "away team" AS team FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
- Result (excerpt): Essendon, Melbourne, Fitzroy, Footscray, Richmond, North Melbourne, Hawthorn, Collingwood, Carlton, St Kilda, Geelong, South Melbourne

2) Identify the highest single-game points and which team(s) achieved it
- SQL executed to compute the maximum points (extracting the integer in parentheses):
SELECT MAX(total_points) AS max_points FROM (
  SELECT "home team", CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
  UNION
  SELECT "away team", CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS total_points
  FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
) AS scores;
- Result: max_points = 138

- SQL executed to identify the team(s) that scored 138:
SELECT "home team" AS team
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) = 138
UNION
SELECT "away team" AS team
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) = 138;
- Result: Hawthorn

3) Context: Top single-game scores (shows Fitzroy’s highest)
- SQL executed:
SELECT "home team" AS team,
       CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS points
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
UNION ALL
SELECT "away team" AS team,
       CAST(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS points
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season
ORDER BY points DESC
LIMIT 10;
- Result (as returned):
  1. Hawthorn – 138
  2. Richmond – 128
  3. North Melbourne – 121
  4. Carlton – 106
  5. Geelong – 104
  6. St Kilda – 99
  7. Melbourne – 98
  8. Fitzroy – 97
  9. Footscray – 89
  10. Collingwood – 89

Conclusion
- The highest single-game score in the dataset is 138 points by Hawthorn. Fitzroy’s top single-game score (from the top-10 listing) is 97 points. Therefore, Fitzroy does not have a higher score than every other team in this dataset.

Assumptions
- "score" is interpreted as a single-game total points score (the integer inside parentheses of the recorded score strings).
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (1975 VFL season only).
- "higher than any of the other team" is interpreted as strictly higher than every other team’s best single-game score (no ties).
