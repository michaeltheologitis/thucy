Claim to verify: “for all 28 match that Atlético Ciudad play, his average be never below 0.61.”

Data sources discovered
- Available database: a PostgreSQL source with table: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (Spanish football Segunda División B 2008-09).

Relevant schema context
- t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b columns: goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision: average goals per match), team (text).

Evidence collected
1) Confirm the team exists in the dataset
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT team FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b ORDER BY team ASC;
- Result: Includes “Atlético Ciudad”.

2) Retrieve the record(s) for Atlético Ciudad
- SQL: SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE '%Atl%Ciu%';
- Result: goalkeeper = Miguel Zapata; goals = 17; matches = 28; average = 0.61; team = Atlético Ciudad.

3) Check if any Atlético Ciudad entry has average < 0.61
- SQL: SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE '%Atl%Ciu%' AND average < 0.61;
- Result: No rows returned.

4) Confirm the observed average is at most 0.61 (to verify equality case)
- SQL: SELECT goalkeeper, goals, matches, average, team FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE '%Atl%Ciu%' AND average <= 0.61;
- Result: goalkeeper = Miguel Zapata; goals = 17; matches = 28; average = 0.61; team = Atlético Ciudad.

5) Check if there are multiple rows for Atlético Ciudad (to rule out other entries with different averages)
- SQL (count): SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_count FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE '%Atl%Ciu%';
- Result: 1
- SQL (names): SELECT goalkeeper FROM t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team ILIKE '%Atl%Ciu%';
- Result: Miguel Zapata

Conclusion
- The dataset contains a single record for Atlético Ciudad’s goalkeeper (Miguel Zapata) with 28 matches and an average of 0.61 goals per match. This supports that, over 28 matches, his recorded average is not below 0.61 (it equals 0.61).
- The phrase “never below 0.61” could imply a per-match running average that was never below that threshold throughout the season. The available data is aggregated at season level for the goalkeeper and does not provide match-by-match running averages, so we cannot test the time-dynamic interpretation. However, under the straightforward reading that the season average across the 28 matches is not below 0.61, the evidence supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- “his average” refers to the goalkeeper’s average goals per match as represented by the ‘average’ column in this dataset.
- “for all 28 match that Atlético Ciudad play” refers to the 28 matches recorded for the Atlético Ciudad goalkeeper in this table, not a running per-match average over time.
- Team naming/accents may vary; searches used a case-insensitive pattern to reliably retrieve the team row.
