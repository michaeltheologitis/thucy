Claim: “the term start for bashkim fino be after the term start for vilson ahmeti.”

Data source exploration:
- Discovered database: TabFact
- Available table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania with columns:
  - name (text)
  - born - died (text)
  - term start (text)
  - term end (text)
  - political party (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve Bashkim Fino’s record
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Fino%';
Result:
- name: bashkim fino
- born - died: 1962 -
- term start: 11 March 1997
- term end: 24 July 1997
- political party: socialist party of albania

2) Retrieve Vilson Ahmeti’s record
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Ahmeti%';
Result:
- name: vilson ahmeti
- born - died: 1951 -
- term start: 10 December 1991
- term end: 13 April 1992
- political party: non - party

Analysis:
- Bashkim Fino term start: 11 March 1997
- Vilson Ahmeti term start: 10 December 1991
Since 1997 is after 1991, Fino’s term start is after Ahmeti’s term start.

Conclusion:
The evidence supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- Names are matched case-insensitively via ILIKE and uniquely identify the intended individuals.
- “term start” refers to the column named exactly “term start” in the table.
