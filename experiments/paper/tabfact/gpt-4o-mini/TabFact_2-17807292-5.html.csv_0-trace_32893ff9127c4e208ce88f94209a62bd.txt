Step 1: Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema/table: public.t_2008_pga_championship
- Description: Records of the 2008 PGA Championship with columns for place, player, country, score, and to par.

Step 2: Relevant schema details
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Step 3: Evidence query and results
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE 'Ben Curtis' OR player ILIKE 'J. B. Holmes' OR player ILIKE 'Steve Flesch' OR player ILIKE 'David Toms' OR player ILIKE 'JB Holmes' OR player ILIKE 'J B Holmes';

Results from the table:
- Ben Curtis — United States
- J. B. Holmes — United States (found as 'j b holmes')
- Steve Flesch — United States
- David Toms — United States

Assessment
- All listed golfers are recorded with country = United States in the 2008 PGA Championship dataset, supporting the claim that they are from the United States.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “david tom” as “David Toms,” the professional golfer, given the context of the other names (all golfers) and the dataset used.
