Claim to verify: “the term end for aleksandër meksi be after the term end for ylli bufi.”

Data discovery and schema context:
- Discovered an accessible relational data source with a relevant table: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania.
- Schema (as identified): columns include name (text), born - died (text), term start (text), term end (text), political party (text).

Evidence 1: Retrieve term start/end for both individuals
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", "term end" FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%';
- Result rows:
  - Name: ylli bufi | Term Start: 5 June 1991 | Term End: 10 December 1991
  - Name: aleksandër meksi | Term Start: 13 April 1992 | Term End: 11 March 1997

Evidence 2: Parse term end dates and compare ordering
- Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term end", TO_DATE("term end", 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_end 
FROM public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Meksi%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%' 
ORDER BY parsed_end ASC;
- Result rows (ordered by parsed_end ascending):
  - Name: ylli bufi | Term End: 10 december 1991 | Parsed End: 1991-12-10
  - Name: aleksandër meksi | Term End: 11 march 1997 | Parsed End: 1997-03-11

Conclusion:
- Aleksandër Meksi’s term end date (1997-03-11) is after Ylli Bufi’s term end date (1991-12-10). The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “term end” as the end date of their service as Prime Minister of Albania, as recorded in the referenced table.
- Used case-insensitive name matching (ILIKE) to account for capitalization/diacritics.
- Parsed textual dates using the Postgres format 'DD Month YYYY'.
