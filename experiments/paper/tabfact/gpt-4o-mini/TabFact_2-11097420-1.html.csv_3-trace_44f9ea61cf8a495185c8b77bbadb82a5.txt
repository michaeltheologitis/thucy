Claim interpreted: The user asserts that (a) the first proposed project/site is “Potter Co” in Copiah County, and (b) it has not yet been listed.

Data sources consulted
- Database: TabFact 21
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (treated as authoritative per instructions)

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate “Potter Co” in Copiah and check proposed/listed status
SQL executed:
SELECT "cerclis id", "name", "county", "proposed", "listed", "construction completed", "partially deleted", "deleted"
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE lower("name") LIKE '%potter%' AND lower("county") LIKE '%copiah%';

Result returned:
- cerclis_id: msd056029648
- name: potter co
- county: copiah
- proposed: 05 / 10 / 1993
- listed: -
- construction_completed: -
- partially_deleted: -
- deleted: -

Interpretation of evidence
- Presence of “potter co” in Copiah County is confirmed.
- “proposed” field shows a date (05/10/1993), indicating it was proposed.
- “listed” field is “-”, indicating not listed on the NPL at the time represented by this dataset. This supports the user’s statement that it “has not yet be[n] listed.”

About “first project propose”
- The dataset confirms the site is proposed but does not, by itself, establish that “Potter Co” is the first proposed site. We attempted to assess earliest “proposed” dates, but consistent, validated date parsing across the entire table was not completed within tool constraints. Therefore, we cannot verify the “first” aspect from the available evidence.

Conclusion
- Verified: The part claiming Potter Co in Copiah has been proposed and is not listed is supported by the data.
- Not established: The claim that it is the “first” proposed project/site cannot be confirmed from the available evidence.

Assumptions
- “Project” refers to a Superfund site entry in the Mississippi Superfund sites table.
- “Listed” refers to final listing on the National Priorities List (NPL).
- “-” in status fields signifies “not applicable/not yet achieved.”
