Observation: The seven opponents listed are all distinct: Wayne Ferreira, Tim Henman, Carlos Moyá, Marat Safin, Gustavo Kuerten, Andre Agassi, Roger Federer.

Evidence 2: Check for any opponent appearing in more than one final
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS finals_count 
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt 
GROUP BY opponent 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

Result: No rows returned (indicates no opponent faced Hewitt in more than one Masters Series final).

Evidence 3: Show counts of opponents and finals to confirm one-to-one mapping
SQL executed:

- Wayne Ferreira: 1

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;

Result:

SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS distinct_opponents FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;

Result:
- distinct_opponents: 7

Conclusion
- The data shows Hewitt reached 7 Masters Series finals against 7 different opponents. There are no repeated opponents across these finals. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The public.lleyton_hewitt table enumerates Lleyton Hewitt’s ATP Masters Series (Masters 1000/former Super 9) finals. The championship names (Stuttgart [Masters], Indian Wells, Cincinnati, Paris) correspond to Masters Series events during the listed years.
