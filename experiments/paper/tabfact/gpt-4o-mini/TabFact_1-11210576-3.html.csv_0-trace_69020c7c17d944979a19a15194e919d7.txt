Claim interpreted: The actor Christian de la Fuente has a recorded duration of appearance listed as “02x03 - 03x05”. We verify this against the available CSI: Miami characters database.

Data source explored: PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_csi_miami_characters containing character, position, actor, first episode, final episode, duration, final episode count.

Evidence 1
- Executed SQL: SELECT character, actor, duration FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters WHERE LOWER(actor) = LOWER('Christian de la Fuente');
- Result: Character: Sam Belmontes; Actor: Christian de la Fuente; Duration: 02x03 - 03x05

Evidence 2 (full row for confirmation)
- Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM list_of_csi_miami_characters WHERE LOWER(actor) = LOWER('Christian de la Fuente');
- Result: Actor: Christian de la Fuente; Character: Sam Belmontes; Position: Trace Technician; First Episode: Hard Time; Final Episode: Legal; Duration: 02x03 - 03x05; Final Episode Count: 7

Conclusion: The database explicitly lists Christian de la Fuente’s duration as “02x03 - 03x05,” which matches the claim.

Assumptions made: The claim refers to the CSI: Miami entry for Christian de la Fuente in the available database.
