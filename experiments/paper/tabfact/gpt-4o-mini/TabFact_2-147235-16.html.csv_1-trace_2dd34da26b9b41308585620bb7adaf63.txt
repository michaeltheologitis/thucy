Summary of findings
- I explored the available data sources and found a relational database (TabFact) with a public schema containing a table named public.chinese_units_of_measurement, which holds fields such as character, jyutping, and relative value.
- I queried this table for the entries corresponding to 厘 and 分. Both entries list the Relative Value as 1 / 1600.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Targeted retrieval of relative value for 厘 and 分
- Result:
  - Character: 厘 | Jyutping: lei4 | Relative Value: 1 / 1600
  - Character: 分 | Jyutping: fan1 | Relative Value: 1 / 1600
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value" FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');

2) Full record context for 厘 and 分
- Result (abridged to key fields):
  - 厘: jyutping=lei4, portuguese=liz, relative value=1 / 1600, metric value=37.79931 mg, imperial value=~0.2133 dr
  - 分: jyutping=fan1, portuguese=condorim, relative value=1 / 1600, metric value=377.9936375 mg, imperial value=~0.2133 dr
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');

Conclusion
- The database records show that the relative value for both 厘 and 分 is 1 / 1600. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “relative value” as the field named "relative value" in the available dataset. The base/unit to which this relative value refers is not specified in the table and was not required to assess the claim as stated.
