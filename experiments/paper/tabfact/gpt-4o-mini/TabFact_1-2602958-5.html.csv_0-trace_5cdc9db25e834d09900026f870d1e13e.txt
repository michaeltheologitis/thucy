- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_catalog AS database_name, table_schema AS schema_name, table_name 
  FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';
  
  SELECT n.nspname AS schema_name FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace n;

  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes';
  
  SELECT * 
  FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
  LIMIT 5;

  SELECT title, '-' AS episode_in_season, no AS overall_no, director 
  FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
  WHERE lower(title) = 'ballrooms and biscotti' 
  LIMIT 5;
- Result: title = Ballrooms and Biscotti; overall_no = 66; director = Amy Sherman-Palladino.

Conclusion
