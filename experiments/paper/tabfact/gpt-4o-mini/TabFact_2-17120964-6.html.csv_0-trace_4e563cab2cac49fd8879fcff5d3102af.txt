Summary
- Claim: “Stuart Potts [was] the man of the match during the League / Cup competition on the 22nd.”
- Conclusion: Supported by the data in the connected PostgreSQL database for the Guildford Flames 2008–09 season.

Data sources explored
- Connected PostgreSQL database.
- Relevant table identified: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season.
- Relevant columns (text): date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, man of the match.

Evidence
1) Context check (sample rows)
SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance, competition, "man of the match"
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
LIMIT 10;
Observed among the sample rows:
- Date: 22nd; Opponent: Wightlink Raiders; Venue: Away; Result: Lost 5 - 4; Attendance: 509; Competition: League / Cup; Man of the Match: Stuart Potts.

2) Direct verification for “22nd”
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE date = '22nd';
Result:
- Date: 22nd
- Opponent: Wightlink Raiders
- Venue: Away
- Result: Lost 5 - 4
- Attendance: 509
- Competition: League / Cup
- Man of the Match: Stuart Potts

Analysis
- The record for the date value “22nd” is explicitly labeled Competition = “League / Cup” and lists “Stuart Potts” as “Man of the Match.”
- This directly matches the claim’s components: the person (Stuart Potts), the competition type (League / Cup), and the day (“22nd”).

Conclusion
- The data confirms that on the 22nd, in a League / Cup fixture, the Man of the Match was Stuart Potts.

Assumptions
- “on the 22nd” refers to the row(s) where the date field equals the textual value “22nd” in this dataset.
- “league / cup competition” corresponds to the Competition column value “League / Cup.”
- The scope of verification is limited to the available 2008–09 Guildford Flames season dataset in the connected database.
