Conclusion
- The franchise total is 1177 points across 45 seasons, but records attribute 44 seasons (1129 points) to “Coquitlam Adanacs” and 1 season (48 points) to “Portland Adanacs.” Thus, the claim is accurate if referring to the franchise history across both names; it is slightly imprecise if interpreted as only seasons explicitly labeled “Coquitlam Adanacs.”

Key Evidence from the Database
1) Schema overview
- Table: public.coquitlam_adanacs
- Columns: season (text), "team name" (text), games (bigint), losses (bigint), points (bigint)

2) Distinct team labels present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "team name" FROM public.coquitlam_adanacs;
Result: Coquitlam Adanacs; Portland Adanacs; 45 Seasons

3) Totals by team label (rows, non-null points rows, total points, distinct seasons)
SQL:
SELECT "team name", COUNT(*) AS rows, COUNT(points) AS nonnull_points_rows, SUM(points) AS total_points, COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS seasons_count
FROM coquitlam_adanacs
GROUP BY "team name";
Results:
- Team name: 45 seasons — rows: 1, nonnull_points_rows: 1, total_points: 1177, seasons_count: 1
- Team name: coquitlam adanacs — rows: 44, nonnull_points_rows: 44, total_points: 1129, seasons_count: 44
- Team name: portland adanacs — rows: 1, nonnull_points_rows: 1, total_points: 48, seasons_count: 1

4) Coquitlam Adanacs only
SQL:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS seasons_count FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE LOWER("team name") = 'coquitlam adanacs';
Result: total_points = 1129; seasons_count = 44

5) Portland Adanacs only
SQL:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS total_seasons 
FROM coquitlam_adanacs 
WHERE LOWER("team name") = 'portland adanacs';
Result: total_points = 48; seasons_count = 1

6) Combined franchise total across Coquitlam Adanacs + Portland Adanacs
SQL:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS seasons_count 
FROM coquitlam_adanacs 
WHERE LOWER("team name") IN ('coquitlam adanacs', 'portland adanacs');
Result: total_points = 1177; seasons_count = 45

7) Summary row verification
SQL:
SELECT * FROM coquitlam_adanacs WHERE LOWER("team name") = '45 seasons' LIMIT 1;
Result: games = 1094; losses = 493; points = 1177 (summary record corroborates the totals)

Assessment
- Numerically correct for the franchise across 45 seasons: 1177 points.
- If restricted strictly to entries labeled “Coquitlam Adanacs,” the totals are 1129 points over 44 seasons. One season (48 points) is recorded as “Portland Adanacs.”

Assumptions
- “Points” are standings points as recorded in the table.
- “45 seasons” refers to the franchise’s seasons encompassing both “Coquitlam Adanacs” and “Portland Adanacs” entries.
