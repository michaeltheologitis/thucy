Claim to verify: "on august 25, remlinger (6 - 6) take the win against the rockies"

Data sources discovered
- public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (per-game 1997 Colorado Rockies results): columns date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

What the data shows
1) Confirm the table structure and sample dates include August entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season LIMIT 10;
- Returned sample (abbrev.): August 1 through August 10 entries, confirming August games are present and that the “loss” column lists the losing pitcher with their record after the decision (e.g., “Rincón (4 - 5)”).

2) Retrieve entries around August 25 to see opponent and pitching decisions
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season OFFSET 20 LIMIT 20;
- Returned relevant rows (verbatim from results):
  - August 24 — Opponent: Astros — Score: 3 - 1 — Loss: Wright (6 - 10) — Record: 62 - 68
  - August 25 — Opponent: Reds — Score: 7 - 6 — Loss: Castillo (10 - 11) — Record: 62 - 69
  - August 25 — Opponent: Reds — Score: 6 - 4 — Loss: Hutton (3 - 2) — Record: 62 - 70
  - August 26 — Opponent: Reds — Score: 9 - 5 — Loss: Martínez (1 - 1) — Record: 63 - 70
  - August 27 — Opponent: Reds — Score: 7 - 5 — Loss: Remlinger (6 - 6) — Record: 64 - 70

Interpretation
- On August 25, the Rockies played a doubleheader versus the Reds and lost both games. The dataset records the losing pitchers as Castillo and Hutton (both Rockies pitchers). It does not list the winning pitchers, but it clearly shows the Rockies were the losing team in both contests on August 25.
- On August 27 (not August 25), the entry shows “Loss: Remlinger (6 - 6)”, indicating Remlinger was the losing pitcher against the Rockies, with his record updated to 6-6 after that loss. This contradicts the claim that he “took the win.”

Conclusion
- The data directly contradicts the statement that “on August 25, Remlinger (6-6) took the win against the Rockies.” On that date, the Rockies lost two games to the Reds, and when Remlinger appears in this log (August 27), he is explicitly listed as the losing pitcher with a 6-6 record after the decision.

Assumptions
- The only available dataset covers the 1997 Colorado Rockies season. I interpreted the claim as referring to August 25, 1997. All conclusions are grounded in this dataset.
