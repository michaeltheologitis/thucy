Claim: “AT90S1200 is the chip with the smallest frequency of more than 12 MHz.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: PostgreSQL (schema: public)
- Relevant table: my_info_table(chip text, "flash size" text, eeprom bigint, sram bigint, frequency bigint, package text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) AT90S1200 frequency
SQL:
SELECT chip, frequency FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(chip) = LOWER('AT90S1200');
Result: chip = at90s1200, frequency = 12 (MHz)

2) Existence of any chip with frequency > 12 MHz
SQL:
SELECT frequency FROM my_info_table WHERE frequency > 12;
Result: No rows returned (no chips above 12 MHz)

3) Validation of available frequency values
SQL:
SELECT frequency FROM my_info_table WHERE frequency IS NOT NULL ORDER BY frequency;
Result: 8, 10, 12 (no values above 12)

Assessment
- AT90S1200’s frequency is exactly 12 MHz, not greater than 12 MHz.
- The dataset contains no chips with frequency > 12 MHz, so there cannot be a “smallest frequency greater than 12 MHz.”

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “frequency” column represents the chip’s maximum rated operating frequency in MHz.
- “smallest frequency of more than 12 MHz” is interpreted as the minimum frequency value strictly greater than 12 MHz among chips in my_info_table.
- Chip name matching is case-insensitive within the table.
