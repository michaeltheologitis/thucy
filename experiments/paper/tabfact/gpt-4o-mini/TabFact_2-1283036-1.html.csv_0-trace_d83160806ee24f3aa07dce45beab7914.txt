Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data in the available database. There is no record showing a screening that started on 29 March 2006 and was completed on 3 May 2006. Related records show a screening starting 27 March 2006 and completing 5 May 2006, but no entries match the specific dates asserted.

Data source and schema used:
- Database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (text columns: "screening started", "screening completed", "chapter unfrozen", "chapter opened", "chapter closed")

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspect sample rows to understand date formats
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 5;
- Result (abridged): Dates are stored as text like "9 March 2006", "3 March 2006", etc.

2) Direct equality checks for the claimed dates
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as count_started FROM my_info_table WHERE "screening started" = '29 March 2006';
- Result: 0
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as count_completed FROM my_info_table WHERE "screening completed" = '3 May 2006';
- Result: 0
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as count_both FROM my_info_table WHERE "screening started" = '29 March 2006' AND "screening completed" = '3 May 2006';
- Result: 0

3) Case-insensitive substring check for the start date
- SQL: SELECT *, COUNT(*) OVER() AS total_count FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER("screening started") LIKE '%29 march 2006%';
- Result: No rows

4) List all screenings that started in March 2006
- SQL: SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER("screening started") LIKE '%march 2006%' ORDER BY "screening started";
- Result:
  - screening started: 27 March 2006 | screening completed: 5 May 2006 | chapter opened: 29 March 2007
  - screening started: 9 March 2006  | screening completed: 28 April 2006 | chapter opened: 30 June 2010
  - Note: No entry with "29 March 2006".

5) List all screenings completed in May 2006
- SQL: SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER("screening completed") LIKE '%may 2006%';
- Result:
  - screening started: 27 March 2006 | screening completed: 5 May 2006 | chapter opened: 29 March 2007
  - Note: No entry with "3 May 2006".

Overall assessment based on evidence:
- There is no record for a screening with start date 29 March 2006 and completion date 3 May 2006. The closest related entry is 27 March 2006 → 5 May 2006. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- The term “screening” refers to entries in public.my_info_table.
- The date format used in the data is day month year (e.g., "29 March 2006").
- The claim’s “march 29, 2006” and “may 3rd, 2006” map to "29 March 2006" and "3 May 2006" in the dataset’s format.
