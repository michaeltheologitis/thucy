Claim interpreted: There are 2 matches that resulted in a draw.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: tim_lajcik (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time)

Evidence from the data
1) Count of draws
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS draw_count FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE res = 'draw';
Result: 1

2) Distribution of all results
SQL:
SELECT res, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.tim_lajcik GROUP BY res;
Result:
- loss: 6
- draw: 1
- win: 7

3) Rows that are draws (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, event, method, round, time FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE LOWER(res) = 'draw';
Result:
- res: draw | opponent: ron waterman | event: ufc 22 | method: draw | round: 3 | time: 5:00

4) Total matches for context
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.tim_lajcik;
Result: 14

Conclusion
- The table contains exactly 1 draw, not 2. Therefore, the claim that 2 matches resulted in a draw is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- “Match” refers to a row in public.tim_lajcik (Tim Lajcik’s recorded bouts in this dataset).
- “Result of a draw” corresponds to rows where res = 'draw' (case-insensitive).
