Summary
- I explored the available data sources and found a single authoritative dataset: a public table of Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins from the 2000s.
- I searched this dataset for any entries mentioning “Dan Fell” and checked whether any such item was released in 2003.

Available data source
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s
- Columns: year (bigint), theme (text), artist (text), mintage (text), issue price (double precision)

Evidence
1) Find any rows mentioning “Dan Fell”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE artist ILIKE '%Dan Fell%' OR theme ILIKE '%Dan Fell%';
- Result: year = 2002

2) Retrieve full details for the “Dan Fell” entry
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE artist ILIKE '%Dan Fell%' OR theme ILIKE '%Dan Fell%';
- Result:
  - Year: 2002
  - Theme: D - 10 Locomotive
  - Artist: Dan Fell
  - Mintage: Included in the gray - dort
  - Issue Price: 59.95

3) List all rows for year 2003 to check for any Dan Fell releases
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE year = 2003;
- Result (artists in 2003): Don Curley, John Mardon, Brian Hughes. No entries for Dan Fell.

4) Explicitly check for Dan Fell in 2003
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s WHERE year = 2003 AND artist ILIKE '%Dan Fell%';
- Result: No rows

Conclusion
- Within the accessible Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins data, the only entry mentioning Dan Fell is from 2002, not 2003. Therefore, the claim that “Dan Fell’s [item] was released in 2003” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and interpretation
- The request was ambiguous. Given that the only available data source concerns Royal Canadian Mint coins, I interpreted the claim as referring to a Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin designed by Dan Fell and its release year. If the claim pertains to a different domain (e.g., music or another product), that information is not available in the accessible data sources.
