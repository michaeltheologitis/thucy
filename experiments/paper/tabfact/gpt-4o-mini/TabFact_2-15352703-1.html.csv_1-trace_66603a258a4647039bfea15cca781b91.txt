Claim interpreted: Whether the last draft pick (in the available dataset) had Arizona as his college.

Data scope discovered:
- Available database contains a single table: public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season with columns (round, pick, player, position, college). This dataset represents the Buffalo Bills’ 1990 draft class (picks with associated colleges).

Key evidence:
1) Identify the last pick by ordering all picks by round DESC, pick DESC:
- Result: Round 11, Pick 293, Player: Al Edwards, Position: Wide Receiver, College: Northwestern State, LA
- Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, player, position, college
FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season
ORDER BY round DESC, pick DESC
LIMIT 1;

2) Cross-check using MAX(round) then MAX(pick) within that round:
- Result: Round 11, Pick 293, Player: Al Edwards, Position: Wide Receiver, College: Northwestern State, LA
- Executed SQL:
SELECT round, pick, player, position, college FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE round = (SELECT MAX(round) FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season) AND pick = (SELECT MAX(pick) FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE round = (SELECT MAX(round) FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season));

3) Check whether any Bills 1990 picks were from Arizona (for context):
- Result: 2 players with college containing 'Arizona'
  • Glenn Parker — Round 3, Pick 70, College: Arizona
  • John Nies — Round 6, Pick 155, College: Arizona
- Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE college ILIKE '%Arizona%';
- Executed SQL (details):
SELECT player, round, pick, college FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE college ILIKE '%Arizona%';

Conclusion:
- In the available dataset (Buffalo Bills 1990 draft class), the last pick’s college is Northwestern State, LA—not Arizona. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence in scope.

Assumptions made:
- "Last draft pick" is interpreted as the final pick within the Buffalo Bills 1990 draft class, as that is the only draft-related data available. If the intent was the overall last pick of an entire league’s draft or another year/team, such data is not present in the accessible sources.
