Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results containing Yugoslavia national team match results.
- Table columns: date (text), city (text), opponent (text), results (text), "type of game" (text). No primary/foreign keys.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find matches vs Denmark (case-insensitive) in World Cup qualifying
- Result: 1 match found — Date: September 27; City: Ljubljana; Opponent: Denmark; Results: 2:1; Type of Game: 1982 WCQ
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" 
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
  WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%den%' 
  AND LOWER("type of game") LIKE '%wcq%';

2) Verify any Denmark entries at all
- Result: 1 match found (same as above)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE opponent ILIKE '%den%';

3) Check if Yugoslavia ever failed to score vs Denmark
- Result: 0 matches where results start with '0:' and opponent contains 'den'
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%den%' AND results LIKE '0:%';
- Executed SQL (detail):
  SELECT * FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%den%' AND results LIKE '0:%';

4) Count all matches where Yugoslavia failed to score (regardless of opponent) and list them
- Result: 1 match
  - Date: November 15; Opponent: Italy; Results: 0:2; City: Torino, Italy; Type of Game: 1982 WCQ
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE results LIKE '0:%';
- Executed SQL (rows):
  SELECT date, opponent, results, city, "type of game"
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
  WHERE results LIKE '0:%';

Assessment of the claim
- "fail to score only 1 time": Supported by the data. The table shows exactly one match where Yugoslavia scored 0 (0:2 vs Italy, 1982 WCQ).
- "drop a world cup qualify match 2:1 against denmark": Contradicted by the data. The only recorded Denmark WCQ match is 2:1 in Ljubljana, which indicates Yugoslavia scored and, given the table’s convention (Yugoslavia’s score first), they won 2–1 rather than dropped the match.

Conclusion
- The dataset supports that Yugoslavia failed to score only once (vs Italy). It does not support that they dropped a WCQ match 2:1 against Denmark; instead it shows a 2:1 in Yugoslavia’s favor.

Assumptions
- The results column lists Yugoslavia’s goals first (e.g., 2:1 means Yugoslavia 2–1 Opponent).
- "1982 WCQ" denotes a FIFA World Cup Qualifier.
- Opponent name matching used case-insensitive searches to account for potential formatting variations.
