Data discovery and schema
- Data source discovered: Database TabFact, schema public.
- Relevant table: public.made_tv_series
- Columns: season (bigint), episode (bigint), episode summary (text), premier date (text), external link (text), coach (text)

Evidence
1) Locate any coach entries containing “kansa” (to identify the exact name)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT season, episode, coach, "episode summary", "premier date" 
  FROM public.made_tv_series 
  WHERE LOWER(coach) LIKE '%kansa%';
- Result:
  Season: 13; Episode: 11; Coach: Katie Kansas; Episode Summary: Shambre is made into a gogo dancer; Premier Date: October 11, 2012

2) Count episodes where the coach is exactly “Katie Kansas” (case-insensitive)

- Result: 1 episode

Conclusion
- The dataset lists coach “Katie Kansas” on exactly one episode (Season 13, Episode 11). This supports the claim that Katie Kansas is a coach for 1 episode.

Assumptions
