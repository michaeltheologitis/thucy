Claim to verify: “Pentium Dual-Core T2410 with sSpec number SLA4J (M0) has Socket P and release date Q2 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors.

Schema inspection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 'list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors' 
    AND table_schema = 'public';
- Relevant columns present: model number (text), sspec number (text), socket (text), release date (text).

Evidence
1) Locate Pentium Dual-Core T2410
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE lower("model number") LIKE '%t2410%';
- Result (key fields):
  • model number: pentium dual - core t2410
  • sspec number: sla4 g (m0)
  • socket: socket p
  • release date: q3 2008
  • other fields for context: frequency 2 ghz; fsb 533 mt/s; l2 cache 1 mb; mult 15; tdp 35 w; voltage 1.075 - 1.175v; part number(s) lf80537 ge0411 m
- Interpretation: For T2410, the sSpec is SLA4G (M0) and the release date is Q3 2008. Socket is Socket P.

2) Verify what CPU has sSpec SLA4J
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE lower("model number") LIKE '%t2370%' OR upper("sspec number") LIKE '%SLA4J%';
- Result (key fields):
  • model number: pentium dual - core t2370
  • sspec number: sla4j (m0)
  • socket: socket p
  • release date: q4 2007
- Interpretation: SLA4J (M0) corresponds to T2370, not T2410.

Assessment of the claim
- sSpec number: The claim assigns SLA4J (M0) to T2410. Data shows T2410’s sSpec is SLA4G (M0). SLA4J (M0) maps to T2370. This part is incorrect.
- Socket: The claim says Socket P. Data confirms T2410 uses Socket P. This part is correct.
- Release date: The claim says Q2 2008. Data shows T2410 was released in Q3 2008. This part is incorrect.

Conclusion
- The only correct element is the socket (Socket P). The sSpec and release date in the claim do not match the data.

Assumptions
- “Release date” is interpreted as the quarter listed in the dataset’s “release date” field.
- sSpec strings in the table like “sla4 g (m0)” are normalized to Intel format “SLA4G (M0).”
