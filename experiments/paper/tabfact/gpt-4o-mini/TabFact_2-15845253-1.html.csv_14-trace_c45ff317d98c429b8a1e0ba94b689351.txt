Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. The database shows 13 virus families with an icosahedral virion shape, not 7.

Data source explored
- Database: public
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence 1: Distinct virion shapes and counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(DISTINCT "family") AS unique_families 
FROM public.viral_disease 
GROUP BY "virion shape";
Result (unique families per shape):
- Complex: 2
- Helical: 6
- Helical, Bullet Shaped: 1
- Icosahedral: 13
- Spherical: 1

Evidence 2: Count of unique families with icosahedral virion shape
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS unique_virus_families_count
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';
Result: 13

Evidence 3: List of families with icosahedral virion shape
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT family
FROM viral_disease
WHERE "virion shape" = 'icosahedral';
Resulting families (13):
- Adenoviridae
- Astroviridae
- Caliciviridae
- Flaviviridae
- Hepadnaviridae
- Hepeviridae
- Papillomaviridae
- Parvoviridae
- Picornaviridae
- Polyomaviridae
- Reoviridae
- Retroviridae
- Togaviridae

Final assessment: The data shows 13 virus families with icosahedral virion shape, contradicting the claim of 7.

Assumptions
- “viral family” maps to the “family” column in public.viral_disease.
- “icosahedral virion shape” corresponds to rows where the “virion shape” field equals “Icosahedral” (case-insensitive match; the counts returned by the executed queries indicate these rows).
