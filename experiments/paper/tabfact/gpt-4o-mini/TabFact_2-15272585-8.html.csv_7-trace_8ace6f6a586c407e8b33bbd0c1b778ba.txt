Summary conclusion
- The claim is inaccurate. In the available data, Galina Voskoboeva has tournament “winner” results (i.e., she did win), and her winner rate differs between Clay and Hard surfaces.

What I checked and found (with executed SQL)
1) Discover the table structure
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'galina_voskoboeva'
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

Key takeaway: The table public.galina_voskoboeva has columns outcome, date, tournament, surface, opponent, score (all text; no constraints).

2) Inspect outcome values to understand what “win” means in this dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT outcome, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY outcome;

Result:
- outcome = 'runner - up' → 3
- outcome = 'winner' → 2
Interpretation: This dataset stores tournament outcomes, not match-level W/L. “Win” corresponds to outcome = 'winner'.

3) Inspect surface values to see how to normalize “Hard” vs “Clay”
SQL executed:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY surface;

Result:
- surface = 'hard (i)' → 2
- surface = 'hard' → 1
- surface = 'clay' → 2
Normalization decision: Treat any surface starting with 'hard' (including 'hard (i)') as Hard; any starting with 'clay' as Clay.

4) Compute winner rate by normalized surface (Hard vs Clay)
SQL executed:
SELECT 
  CASE 
    WHEN LOWER(surface) LIKE 'hard%' THEN 'Hard'
    WHEN LOWER(surface) LIKE 'clay%' THEN 'Clay'
  END AS normalized_surface,
  COUNT(*) AS entry_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN outcome = 'winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS winner_count,
  SUM(CASE WHEN outcome = 'runner - up' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS runner_up_count,
  ROUND(SUM(CASE WHEN outcome = 'winner' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)::numeric / NULLIF(COUNT(*), 0), 2) AS winner_rate
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva
WHERE LOWER(surface) LIKE 'hard%' OR LOWER(surface) LIKE 'clay%'
GROUP BY normalized_surface
ORDER BY normalized_surface;

Results:
- Clay: entry_count = 2, winner_count = 1, runner_up_count = 1, winner_rate = 0.50
- Hard: entry_count = 3, winner_count = 1, runner_up_count = 2, winner_rate = 0.33
Interpretation: Winner rates are not equal (50% on Clay vs 33% on Hard).

5) Verify whether she “never wins”
Evidence from step (2) already shows outcome='winner' occurs 2 times. For completeness, total winners across all rows:
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE outcome = 'winner') AS total_wins
FROM public.galina_voskoboeva;

Result:
- total_wins = 2
Interpretation: She did win (at least twice in the dataset). The statement “she never win” is contradicted by the data.

Final assessment of the claim
- “equal winrate between both clay and hard court” → False (0.50 vs 0.33 winner rates)
- “but she never win” → False (there are 2 'winner' outcomes)

Assumptions made
- “Winrate” is interpreted as the proportion of tournament entries resulting in outcome = 'winner' for each surface because the dataset stores tournament outcomes (winner, runner-up) rather than match-level W/L.
- “Hard court” includes 'hard' and 'hard (i)' (indoor hard).
- Analysis is limited to the provided dataset, which is treated as accurate and complete within its scope.
