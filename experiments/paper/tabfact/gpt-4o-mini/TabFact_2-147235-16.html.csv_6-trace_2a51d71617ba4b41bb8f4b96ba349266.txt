Claim assessed: “The relative value for 厘 and 分 is different from each other.”

Evidence from the data source
1) Retrieved rows for 厘 and 分
- Result:
  • 厘 — jyutping: lei4; portuguese: liz; relative value: 1 / 1600; metric value: 37.79931 mg; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr
  • 分 — jyutping: fan1; portuguese: condorim; relative value: 1 / 1600; metric value: 377.9936375 mg; imperial value: ~0.2133 dr
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT jyutping, character, portuguese, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" FROM chinese_units_of_measurement WHERE character IN ('厘', '分');

2) Checked counts and distinct relative values per character to ensure no alternate entries
- Result:
  • 分 — row_count: 1; distinct_relative_values: 1
  • 厘 — row_count: 1; distinct_relative_values: 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT character, COUNT(*) as row_count, COUNT(DISTINCT "relative value") as distinct_relative_values 
  FROM chinese_units_of_measurement 
  WHERE character IN ('厘', '分') 
  GROUP BY character;

Analysis
- Both 厘 and 分 have the same recorded relative value: 1 / 1600. There is exactly one row for each character and no alternative relative values recorded. Therefore, the claim that their relative values are different is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The data shows no difference in relative value between 厘 and 分; both are listed as 1 / 1600.

Assumptions
- “Relative value” refers to the authoritative comparative unit field in the chinese_units_of_measurement table.
- The database contains the relevant canonical entries for these units without missing context-specific variants.
