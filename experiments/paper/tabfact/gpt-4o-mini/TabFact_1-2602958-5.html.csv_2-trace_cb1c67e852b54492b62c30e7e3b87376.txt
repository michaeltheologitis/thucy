Data source consulted: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes

What the data shows

- Episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino: 1
- Difference (Daniel − Amy): 0

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Count of episodes directed by Daniel Palladino (robust match, excluding any Amy mentions)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count
FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE lower(director) LIKE '%daniel%palladino%'
  AND lower(director) NOT LIKE '%amy%';
Result: 1

2) Count of episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino (robust match for Amy … Palladino)
SQL:

FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes
WHERE lower(director) LIKE '%amy%palladino%';

4) Listing the matching Amy Sherman-Palladino-directed episode

Conclusion
- The data shows Daniel Palladino and Amy Sherman-Palladino each directed 1 episode of Gilmore Girls in this dataset. Therefore, Daniel did not direct 1 more episode than Amy; they are equal.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains specifically to Gilmore Girls, as that is the available authoritative dataset.
- Director counts are based on the director column textual credits per episode row; if an episode had co-directors, each credited person would be counted (none observed here).
- Name matching accounts for case and minor punctuation variations via ILIKE/lower() pattern matching.
