Claim to verify: "linda fratianne finish in first place , but anett pötzsch do not manage to get in the top 3"

Summary of findings:
- Linda Fratianne did finish in first place (in the accessible dataset for the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships).
- Anett Pötzsch did make the top 3; she finished 2nd in the same dataset. This contradicts the claim’s second part.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Full ranking context (shows both athletes and their ranks)
SQL: 
SELECT rank, name, nation, points 
FROM t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships 
WHERE name IN ('Linda Fratianne', 'Anett Pötzsch') 
OR TRUE 
ORDER BY rank ASC;
Key returned rows:
- Rank 1 | Name: Linda Fratianne | Nation: United States | Points: 186.92
- Rank 2 | Name: Anett Pötzsch | Nation: East Germany | Points: 184.36

2) Targeted lookup for the two skaters
SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation, points 
FROM t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Fratianne%' OR name ILIKE 'Anett%P%tzsch%' 
ORDER BY rank;
Returned rows:
- Rank 1, Name: Linda Fratianne, Nation: United States, Points: 186.92
- Rank 2, Name: Anett Pötzsch, Nation: East Germany, Points: 184.36

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- "linda fratianne finish in first place" – Supported by data (true for 1979 Worlds).
- "anett pötzsch do not manage to get in the top 3" – Contradicted by data (she placed 2nd in 1979 Worlds).

Conclusion: The claim contains one true and one false component based on the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions:
- Because the question did not specify an event, I interpreted it using the available dataset for the 1979 World Figure Skating Championships. If the claim intended a different event, results may differ, but no other datasets were accessible here.
