Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
- Columns (all text): "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"

Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret the statement as: In the row where the away team is Woking, the value in the column "tie no" (which appears before the "away team" column in the table) is 5.

Evidence
1) Check whether any match has away team = Woking (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE LOWER("away team") = LOWER('Woking');
- Result: No rows returned (there are no matches in this table where the away team is Woking).

2) Verify if Woking appears at all (either home or away) to ensure spelling/casing isn’t the issue
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%woking%' OR LOWER("away team") LIKE '%woking%';
- Result:
  - tie no: 5; home team: Woking; score: 0 - 1; away team: Everton; date: 27 / 01 / 1991
  - Interpretation: Woking appears as the home team (not away) in tie no 5.

3) Confirm details for tie no = '5'
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
WHERE "tie no" = '5';
- Result:
  - tie no: 5; home team: Woking; score: 0 - 1; away team: Everton; date: 27 / 01 / 1991

Conclusion
- There is no row where the away team is Woking. Therefore the claim that “5 be the tie no before the away team be woking” (i.e., the tie number for the row with away team Woking is 5) is not supported by the data. The only occurrence of Woking in this table shows Woking as the home team in tie no 5 against Everton.

Assumptions
- “Before the away team” was interpreted as the tie number value in the same row where the away team equals Woking (a common TabFact phrasing). 
- Matching was done case-insensitively for team names.
- The verification is limited to the provided 1990-91 FA Cup table (public.t_1990_91_fa_cup).
