Claim interpreted: Within the 2002 U.S. Open golf dataset, Nick Faldo is the only player whose country is listed as England.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf containing columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence
1) Players from England and distinct count
- SQL (players from England):
  SELECT player FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(country) = 'england';
  Result: Nick Faldo
- SQL (distinct count from England):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_player_count FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(country) = 'england';
  Result: 1 distinct player

2) Distinct players by country (to confirm uniqueness)
- SQL:
  SELECT country, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_player_count
  FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf
  GROUP BY country;
- Results:
  - Australia: 1
  - England: 1
  - Ireland: 1
  - Spain: 1
  - United States: 8
  This confirms that exactly one player is recorded from England.

3) Direct lookup for Faldo (cross-check)
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Faldo%';
- Result row:
  - Place: t8
  - Player: Nick Faldo
  - Country: England
  - Score: 70 + 76 + 66 = 212
  - To Par: + 2

Conclusion
- The dataset shows a single player from England, and that player is Nick Faldo. Therefore, within this dataset, the claim is supported.

Assumptions
- The user’s claim refers to the specific dataset available (the 2002 U.S. Open golf table). If the claim was meant more broadly (e.g., across all majors, world rankings, or all years), additional datasets would be required; this verification is limited to the available table.
