Claim to verify: "route 24 intersects with pleasant street turnpike street lindelof avenue"

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: massachusetts_route_139 (columns: county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes)

Key evidence from data:
1) Identify where Route 24 is listed as an intersecting road on MA 139 and see associated street names.
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, milepost, "roads intersected", "street names", notes 
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 
WHERE "roads intersected" LIKE '%route 24%';
Result summary: One row returned — County: Norfolk; Location: Stoughton; Milepost: 3.0; Roads Intersected: Route 24; Street Names: Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, Lindelof Avenue; Notes: Route 24 exit 20.

2) Confirm that all three names (Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, Lindelof Avenue) are present on the same Route 24 intersection row.
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, milepost, notes FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE "roads intersected" ILIKE '%route 24%' AND lower("street names") LIKE '%pleasant street%' AND lower("street names") LIKE '%turnpike street%' AND lower("street names") LIKE '%lindelof avenue%';
Result summary: Returned the same intersection (Norfolk County, Stoughton, milepost 3.0, notes: Route 24 exit 20), confirming all three names appear together for the Route 24 intersection.

Conclusion:
- The authoritative dataset shows that Massachusetts Route 139 intersects Route 24 at Stoughton (Route 24 exit 20), and the local street names associated with this segment of MA 139 are Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue. Therefore, the claim that Route 24 intersects with Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Route 24 interchange with MA 139 in Stoughton, where MA 139 is locally named Pleasant Street, Turnpike Street, and Lindelof Avenue in/near that interchange area.
