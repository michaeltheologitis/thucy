Claim to verify: "the lion finish with a record of 4 win and 8 loss"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint)

Evidence
1) Game-by-game results for the 1976 Detroit Lions
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, opponent, result FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season ORDER BY week;
Result (abridged to key fields):
Week 1: chicago bears — l 10 - 3
Week 2: atlanta falcons — w 24 - 10
Week 3: minnesota vikings — l 10 - 9
Week 4: green bay packers — l 24 - 14
Week 5: new england patriots — w 30 - 10
Week 6: washington redskins — l 20 - 7
Week 7: seattle seahawks — w 41 - 14
Week 8: green bay packers — w 27 - 6
Week 9: minnesota vikings — l 31 - 23
Week 10: new orleans saints — l 17 - 16
Week 11: chicago bears — w 14 - 10
Week 12: buffalo bills — w 27 - 14
Week 13: new york giants — l 24 - 10
Week 14: los angeles rams — l 20 - 17

2) Aggregated record calculation from the result column
- Wins
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as wins FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE result LIKE 'w %'
Query result: 6

- Losses
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as losses FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season WHERE result LIKE 'l %'
Query result: 8

- Total games
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_games FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
Query result: 14

- Final record (computed in one query)
Executed SQL:
SELECT CONCAT(SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'w %' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END), ' - ', SUM(CASE WHEN result LIKE 'l %' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END)) AS final_record FROM public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season
Query result: 6 - 8

Assessment
- The verified 1976 Detroit Lions final record is 6–8 over 14 games.
- The claim states a 4–8 record (12 games), which does not match the data. The team recorded 6 wins, not 4, and played 14 games, not 12.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "the lion" as the Detroit Lions NFL team and, given the available data source, evaluated the 1976 season contained in the database. If a different team, league, or season was intended, that information was not present in the accessible data sources.
