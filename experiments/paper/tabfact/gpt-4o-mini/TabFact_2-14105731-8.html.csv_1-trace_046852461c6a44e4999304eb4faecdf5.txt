Summary
- Claim: “season 6.0 have q245 as its format.”
- Interpretation: “season 6.0” corresponds to season = 6 in the available dataset (season is stored as an integer). We check whether the format for season 6 is q245.

Data source overview
- Database schema discovered: public schema with one table: my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), season (bigint), format (text), title (text), original airdate (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve all rows for season = 6
- SQL: SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE season = 6;
- Result: one row found with format = q145
  - episode = 222; season = 6; format = q145; title = denisa 's greedy doll / denisa 's slumber party; original airdate = september 24 , 1988

2) Distinct formats for season = 6
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT format FROM my_info_table WHERE season = 6;
- Result: q145

3) Check if any row has format = 'q245'
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) as row_count FROM my_info_table WHERE format = 'q245';
- Result: 0 rows

Conclusion
- The dataset shows season 6 has format q145, not q245. There are no rows with format q245 at all. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “season 6.0” is equivalent to season number 6 in this dataset (season stored as integer). If “season 6.0” or “q245” refer to entities outside this dataset, that context is not present in the available data; this verification is strictly based on the accessible table.
