Claim interpreted: The only person listed as a prison escapist has a status of dead.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: cube_film_series with columns: name, occupation, gender, prison connection, played by, status

Evidence from data queries
1) Verify how many entries are listed as “prison escapist”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT occupation, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.cube_film_series GROUP BY occupation;
- Result (excerpt):
  - prison escapist: 1
  This shows there is exactly one row where occupation = 'prison escapist'.

2) Retrieve the status of the person whose occupation is “prison escapist”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, status FROM cube_film_series WHERE occupation = 'prison escapist';
- Result:
  - name: rennes, status: dead
  This confirms the sole “prison escapist” is marked as dead.

Conclusion
- The dataset contains exactly one entry with occupation = 'prison escapist', and that entry’s status is dead. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “listed as a prison escapist” is interpreted as occupation = 'prison escapist' in the cube_film_series table.
- “status” refers to the status column in the same table.
