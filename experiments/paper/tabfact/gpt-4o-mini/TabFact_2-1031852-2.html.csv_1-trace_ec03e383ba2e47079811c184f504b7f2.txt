Summary of data environment
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing a single table: public.lexington_legends.
- Relevant columns for this verification: season, mlb affiliate, post - season record.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify available MLB affiliates in the dataset
- Purpose: Confirm whether “houston” appears as an MLB affiliate value and how many rows are associated with it.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "mlb affiliate", COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  GROUP BY "mlb affiliate";
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  - kansas city: 1 row
  - houston: 12 rows

2) Retrieve post-season records for rows affiliated with Houston
- Purpose: Determine whether rows affiliated with “houston” have any recorded post-season record values.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, "post - season record" FROM public.lexington_legends WHERE lower("mlb affiliate") = 'houston' ORDER BY season;
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  - 2001 | 4 - 0
  - 2002 | -
  - 2003 | 0 - 2 ♦
  - 2004 | -
  - 2005 | -
  - 2006 | 0 - 2 ♦
  - 2007 | -
  - 2008 | -
  - 2009 | -
  - 2010 | -
  - 2011 | -
  - 2012 | -

3) Count of seasons with and without a post-season record among Houston-affiliated rows
- Purpose: Quantify how many Houston rows have a non-empty/non-"-" post-season record versus none.
- Executed SQL (three separate queries, as returned by the tool):
  -- Total rows (Houston)
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  WHERE lower("mlb affiliate") = 'houston';

  -- Rows with non-empty/non-'-' post-season record
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_empty_post_season
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  WHERE lower("mlb affiliate") = 'houston'
    AND "post - season record" IS NOT NULL AND "post - season record" != '-';

  -- Rows with NULL or '-' post-season record (interpreted as no record)
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS no_post_season_record
  FROM public.lexington_legends
  WHERE lower("mlb affiliate") = 'houston'
    AND ("post - season record" IS NULL OR "post - season record" = '-');
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  - Total rows: 12
  - Non-empty/non-"-" post-season record: 3
  - NULL or "-" post-season record: 9

Conclusion
- The dataset contains multiple Houston-affiliated seasons with explicit post-season records (e.g., 2001: 4 - 0; 2003: 0 - 2; 2006: 0 - 2). Therefore, the statement “houston have no post - season record” is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted “houston” as the value in the mlb affiliate column within the public.lexington_legends table, since this is the only available data source mentioning Houston.
- Interpreted “no post - season record” to mean that no recorded post-season record exists across all Houston-affiliated rows (i.e., all values would be NULL or “-”). The data shows otherwise.
