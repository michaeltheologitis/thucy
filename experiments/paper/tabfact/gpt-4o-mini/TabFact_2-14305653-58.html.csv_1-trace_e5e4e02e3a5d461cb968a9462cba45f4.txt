Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and examined the schema to ground verification in the actual dataset.
- Queried the matches dataset to locate the specific match on August 27 and to evaluate whether it represents the worst outcome (largest negative goal difference) for Yugoslavia in the available data.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database with one table: public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results

Schema (relevant columns)
- date (text)
- city (text)
- opponent (text)
- results (text) — in format GF:GA from Yugoslavia’s perspective
- type of game (text)

Evidence 1: List of all matches (to locate August 27 match and its context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" 
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
ORDER BY date;

Result excerpt (as returned by the tool):
- April 26 | Borovo | Poland | 2:1 | Friendly
- March 22 | Sarajevo | Uruguay | 2:1 | Friendly
- March 30 | Belgrade | Romania | 2:0 | Balkan Cup
- August 27 | Bucharest, Romania | Romania | 1:4 | Balkan Cup
- September 10 | Luxembourg | Luxembourg | 5:0 | 1982 WCQ
- September 27 | Ljubljana | Denmark | 2:1 | 1982 WCQ
- November 15 | Torino, Italy | Italy | 0:2 | 1982 WCQ

This directly confirms: a Balkan Cup match vs Romania on August 27 with a 1:4 loss.

Evidence 2: Identify all losses and their goal differences
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game", 
       CAST(split_part(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) AS goals_for,
       CAST(split_part(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER) AS goals_against,
       (CAST(split_part(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) - CAST(split_part(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS goal_diff
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE CAST(split_part(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) < CAST(split_part(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)
ORDER BY goal_diff ASC;

Returned losses:
- August 27 | Bucharest, Romania | Romania | 1:4 | Balkan Cup | GF 1 | GA 4 | GD -3
- November 15 | Torino, Italy | Italy | 0:2 | 1982 WCQ | GF 0 | GA 2 | GD -2

Evidence 3: Explicitly compute the worst (minimum) goal difference
Executed SQL:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game",
         CAST(split_part(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) AS gf,
         CAST(split_part(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER) AS ga,
         (CAST(split_part(results, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) - CAST(split_part(results, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS gd
  FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
)
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game", gf, ga, gd
FROM parsed
WHERE gd = (SELECT MIN(gd) FROM parsed)
ORDER BY date;

Result:
- August 27 | Bucharest, Romania | Romania | 1:4 | Balkan Cup | gf 1 | ga 4 | gd -3

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that on August 27, Yugoslavia lost 1:4 to Romania in the Balkan Cup.
- Among all matches in the dataset, this is the worst outcome for Yugoslavia by goal difference (-3), confirming the claim as stated.

Assumptions noted
- “Worst outcome” is interpreted as the largest negative goal difference for Yugoslavia within the available dataset. The dataset does not include explicit years; the date “August 27” is matched exactly as stored in the data.
