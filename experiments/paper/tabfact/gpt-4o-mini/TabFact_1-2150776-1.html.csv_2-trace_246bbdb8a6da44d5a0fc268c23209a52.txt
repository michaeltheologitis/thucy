Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and identified a single database with a table containing race event data (drivers, teams, dates, etc.).
- Explored the table structure and sampled records to understand date formatting and content.
- Queried specifically for the 1996 entry on June 16 for Jeff Gordon to verify the team listed.

Data source
- Database: pocono_400 (public)
- Table: pocono_400
- Relevant columns: year (bigint), date (text), driver (text), team (text), manufacturer (text), laps (bigint), report (text), etc.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Initial sampling to understand data content and date formatting
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, driver, team, year FROM pocono_400 LIMIT 20;
- Result (excerpt as returned by the tool): includes a row
  | Date     | Driver       | Team                   | Year |
  | june 16  | jeff gordon  | hendrick motorsports   | 1996 |

- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT year FROM pocono_400;
- Result: includes 1996 among other years (1982–2012 listed by the tool).

2) Targeted verification for June 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, year, driver, team, manufacturer, laps 
  FROM pocono_400 
  WHERE year = 1996 
  AND date = 'june 16' 
  AND driver = 'jeff gordon';
- Returned row:
  - Date: June 16
  - Year: 1996
  - Driver: Jeff Gordon
  - Team: Hendrick Motorsports
  - Manufacturer: Chevrolet
  - Laps: 200

Conclusion
- The database record for June 16, 1996 explicitly lists Jeff Gordon with team “Hendrick Motorsports.” This supports the claim that on Jun 16, 1996, Jeff Gordon drove for Hendrick Motorsports.

Assumptions
- “Drive for” is interpreted as the team listed for Jeff Gordon in the event record on that date.
- Date normalization: the table stores the month/day in the “date” text field (e.g., “june 16”) and the year separately in the “year” column; matching was done using date = 'june 16' and year = 1996.
