Claim to verify: "grand fork county have 36.199 square mile of land"

Summary conclusion: The available data shows that the total land area recorded for the county labeled "grand forks" sums to 36.199 square miles. This matches the claim.

Data discovery
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database, schema public, table: list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
- Relevant columns: township (text), county (text), land ( sqmi ) (double precision), water (sqmi) (double precision), etc.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm the county name exists in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT county 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
ORDER BY county ASC 
LIMIT 50;
Result excerpt: includes "grand forks"

2) Compute total land area for county = "grand forks"
SQL:
SELECT SUM("land ( sqmi )") AS total_land_area 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE LOWER(county) = 'grand forks';
Result: total_land_area ≈ 36.199

3) Return total land area with 3-decimal precision
SQL:
SELECT SUM("land ( sqmi )")::numeric(10,3) AS total_land_area 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE county = 'grand forks';
Result: total_land_area = 36.199

4) Verify how many rows/townships contribute to this sum
SQL:
SELECT SUM("land ( sqmi )") AS total_land_area, COUNT(township) AS number_of_townships 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE LOWER(county) = 'grand forks';
Result: total_land_area ≈ 36.199; number_of_townships = 1

5) Inspect the contributing township row(s)
SQL:
SELECT township, county, "land ( sqmi )" AS land_area 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE LOWER(county) = 'grand forks';
Result: township = Johnstown; county = Grand Forks; land_area = 36.199

Assessment
- The dataset records a single township (Johnstown) under the county labeled "grand forks," with a land area of 36.199 sq mi, and the sum across the county equals 36.199 sq mi. This directly matches the claimed figure.

Final note on scope: The verification is grounded strictly in the provided dataset. Within this data, the county-level sum equals 36.199 sq mi.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "grand fork county" as Grand Forks County, North Dakota.
- Interpreted "square mile of land" as the land ( sqmi ) field in the dataset.
- Treated the available dataset as authoritative within its scope, per instructions.
