Summary
- Interpreting the claim as: “Was the highest game attendance (in the available dataset) at the Target Center?” Using the 2008–09 Phoenix Suns season game-log table as the authoritative data source.

Data source and relevant schema
- Database table: t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
- Relevant columns: date (text), team (text), "location attendance" (text, contains venue name and possibly a trailing numeric attendance)

Evidence
1) Inspect sample rows and the format of the location/attendance field
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season LIMIT 20;
SELECT DISTINCT "location attendance" FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season LIMIT 20;
Observed examples show venue names and, when available, a trailing integer attendance (e.g., “target center 18478”, “american airlines center 20301”, “us airways center 18422”). Some entries lack a trailing number (no attendance recorded).

2) Top attendances by parsing trailing number as attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT
  date,
  team,
  "location attendance" AS loc_att,
  trim(regexp_replace("location attendance", '\s*\d+$', '')) AS venue,
  (regexp_match("location attendance", '(\d+)$'))[1]::int AS attendance
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\\d+$'
ORDER BY attendance DESC
LIMIT 10;
Result (top entries summarized):
- American Airlines Center — 20,301 (Date: April 5; Team: Dallas)
- Target Center — 18,478 (Date: April 11; Team: Minnesota)
- US Airways Center — 18,422 (multiple dates)
- New Orleans Arena — 17,781
- FedExForum — 15,908

3) Overall maximum attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX((regexp_match("location attendance", '(\\d+)$'))[1]::int) AS max_attendance
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\\d+$';
Result: 20,301

4) Game(s) at the overall maximum attendance
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT
    date,
    team,
    trim(regexp_replace("location attendance", '\\s*\\d+$', '')) AS venue,
    (regexp_match("location attendance", '(\\d+)$'))[1]::int AS attendance
  FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
  WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\\d+$'
)
SELECT date, team, venue, attendance
FROM parsed
WHERE attendance = (SELECT MAX(attendance) FROM parsed);
Result: American Airlines Center — 20,301 (Date: April 5; Team: Dallas)

5) Highest attendance specifically at Target Center
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT
    trim(regexp_replace("location attendance", '\\s*\\d+$', '')) AS venue,
    (regexp_match("location attendance", '(\\d+)$'))[1]::int AS attendance
  FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
  WHERE "location attendance" ~ '\\d+$'
)
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance_at_target_center
FROM parsed
WHERE lower(venue) = 'target center';
Result: 18,478

Conclusion
- The highest attendance in this dataset is 20,301 at American Airlines Center, not at Target Center. The highest attendance observed at Target Center is 18,478. Therefore, the claim that the highest attendance was at the Target Center is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The verification is constrained to the available table (t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season), which appears to contain Phoenix Suns 2008–09 season game logs only.
- “Target Center” refers to the Minnesota Timberwolves’ arena.
- Attendance values are taken from the trailing integer in the "location attendance" field; rows without a trailing integer are treated as missing attendance and excluded from max computations.
