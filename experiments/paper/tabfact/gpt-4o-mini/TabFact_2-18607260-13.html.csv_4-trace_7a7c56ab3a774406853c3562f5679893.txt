Claim to verify: “the game on June 18 and 28, 1998 both have a score of 1 - 1.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football (columns: date text, venue text, score text, comp text, report text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Inspect available dates to understand formatting and see if June 18 and June 28, 1998 are present
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football LIMIT 50;
- Result excerpt (as returned):
  1998 - 06 - 24; 1998 - 06 - 28; 1998 - 05 - 21; 1998 - 03 - 14; 1998 - 03 - 18; 1998 - 05 - 17; 1998 - 04 - 22; 1998 - 06 - 12; 1998 - 02 - 08; 1998 - 06 - 19; 1998 - 06 - 01; 1998 - 06 - 06; 1998 - 06 - 03; 1998 - 03 - 28.
- Observation: The date “1998 - 06 - 28” exists; “1998 - 06 - 18” does not appear in these distinct values.

2) Verify the match and score on June 28, 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '%1998 - 06 - 28%';
- Result:
  date: 1998 - 06 - 28; venue: stade félix bollaert lens, france; score: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet); comp: world cup; report: report.
- Conclusion: The recorded score for June 28, 1998 is “0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet),” not “1 - 1.”

3) Check for any match on June 18, 1998
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, score, comp, report FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '%1998 - 06 - 18%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Conclusion: There is no match recorded on June 18, 1998 in this dataset.

4) Enumerate all June 1998 matches and scores to confirm no 1 - 1 draw
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date LIKE '1998 - 06 - %' ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  1998 - 06 - 01: 5 - 1
  1998 - 06 - 03: 3 - 2
  1998 - 06 - 06: 1 - 0
  1998 - 06 - 12: 0 - 0
  1998 - 06 - 19: 0 - 0
  1998 - 06 - 24: 1 - 3
  1998 - 06 - 28: 0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet)
- Conclusion: No June 1998 match in this table has a score of “1 - 1.”

Assessment
- June 28, 1998: The recorded score is “0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet),” not “1 - 1.”
- June 18, 1998: No match is recorded on that date in this dataset.
- Therefore, the claim that both games on June 18 and 28, 1998 have a score of 1 - 1 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to matches represented in the available dataset (1998 in Paraguayan football), which includes national team World Cup fixtures involving Paraguay.
- Date format in the table is treated literally as text “YYYY - MM - DD.”
- “Score of 1 - 1” is interpreted as the match result either at full time or as recorded in the table’s “score” field. The June 28 entry explicitly shows 0 - 0 in regulation, with 1 - 0 after extra time, which still is not 1 - 1.
