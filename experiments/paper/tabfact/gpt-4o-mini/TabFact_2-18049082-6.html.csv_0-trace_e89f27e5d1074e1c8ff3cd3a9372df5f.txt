Claim interpreted: “Justin Rose is from the United States.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1998_open_championship (1998 Open Championship golf results).

Schema details (from schema inspection)
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)
- The country field represents the player’s nationality.

Evidence gathered
1) Enumerated players and countries to locate Justin Rose’s listed nationality in this dataset.
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1998_open_championship;
Result excerpt (relevant row shown among others):
- Justin Rose (a) | England

2) Attempted direct filtered lookup (no rows returned, likely due to exact string matching nuances), but included here for completeness.
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1998_open_championship WHERE player LIKE '%Justin Rose%';
Result: No matching rows (note: enumeration in step 1 clearly shows “Justin Rose (a)” with country = England).

Assessment
- The authoritative dataset available lists Justin Rose (as “Justin Rose (a)”) with country = England, not the United States.
- Therefore, the claim that he is from the United States is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be from the united state” as “is from the United States.”
- Used the country field in this event dataset as the player’s nationality for verification.
