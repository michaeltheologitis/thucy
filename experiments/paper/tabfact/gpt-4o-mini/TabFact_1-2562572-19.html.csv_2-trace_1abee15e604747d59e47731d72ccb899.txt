Claim: “the settlement titel and lok differ only in population.”

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina
  - Columns: settlement, cyrillic name, type, population (2011), largest ethnic group (2002), dominant religion (2002)

Evidence collected
1) Locate records for Titel and Lok (case-insensitive match)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE LOWER(settlement) = LOWER('titel');
Result:
- settlement: titel
- cyrillic name: тител
- type: town
- population (2011): 5294
- largest ethnic group (2002): Serbs
- dominant religion (2002): Orthodox Christianity

SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE LOWER(settlement) = LOWER('lok');
Result:
- settlement: lok
- cyrillic name: лок
- type: village
- population (2011): 1114
- largest ethnic group (2002): Serbs
- dominant religion (2002): Orthodox Christianity

2) Attribute-by-attribute comparison (to check if anything besides population differs)
Type
- SQL: SELECT type FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'titel';
  Result: town
- SQL: SELECT type FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'lok';
  Result: village
- Match: False (they differ)

Largest ethnic group (2002)
- SQL: SELECT "largest ethnic group (2002)" FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'titel';
  Result: serbs
- SQL: SELECT "largest ethnic group (2002)" FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'lok';
  Result: serbs
- Match: True (they are the same)

Dominant religion (2002)
- SQL: SELECT "dominant religion (2002)" FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'titel';
  Result: orthodox christianity
- SQL: SELECT "dominant religion (2002)" FROM public.list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement = 'lok';
  Result: orthodox christianity
- Match: True (they are the same)

Conclusion
- Titel and Lok do not differ only in population; they also differ in type (Titel is a town; Lok is a village). Other listed attributes (largest ethnic group and dominant religion) are the same.

Assumptions
- “titel” and “lok” refer to the settlements recorded in the Vojvodina settlements table.
- “differ only” is interpreted across the table’s comparable attributes: type, largest ethnic group (2002), and dominant religion (2002), excluding the obvious difference in the settlement name itself.
