Scope of verification: Based on the available authoritative data source we have (2010 Vuelta a España stages and winners), we verify whether Mark Cavendish is the only rider with back-to-back stage wins in that race.

2) Identify consecutive stage wins by the same rider
Executed SQL:
SELECT a.stage AS stage1, b.stage AS stage2, a.winner
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a a
JOIN public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a b
  ON a.winner = b.winner
WHERE a.stage + 1 = b.stage
ORDER BY a.stage;
Finding: The only consecutive win pair is Mark Cavendish on stages 12 and 13.

3) Count riders with any back-to-back win pairs
Executed SQL:
SELECT winner, COUNT(*) AS consecutive_wins
FROM (
  SELECT winner,
         stage,
         LEAD(winner) OVER (ORDER BY stage) AS next_winner
  FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
) AS subquery
WHERE winner = next_winner
GROUP BY winner;
Finding: Only Mark Cavendish appears, with 1 consecutive-win pair.

4) Mark Cavendish’s stage wins in this race
Executed SQL:
SELECT stage AS stage_number, winner
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
WHERE winner = 'Mark Cavendish'
ORDER BY stage;
Finding: Cavendish won stages 12, 13 (consecutive), and 18.

Conclusion
- Within the 2010 Vuelta a España dataset, Mark Cavendish is the only rider who won two consecutive stages (stages 12 and 13). The data supports the claim in this context.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The user’s wording is ambiguous about the event/timeframe. I interpreted it to mean within the scope of the available dataset (2010 Vuelta a España). Broader claims about all races or all years are outside the scope of the accessible data here and are not asserted.
