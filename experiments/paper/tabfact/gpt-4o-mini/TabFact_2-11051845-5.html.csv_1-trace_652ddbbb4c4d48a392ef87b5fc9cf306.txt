Claim interpreted: “Spiral galaxy have the least apparent magnitude.” I interpret “least apparent magnitude” as the smallest numerical apparent magnitude (i.e., brightest appearance). I verify this against the available authoritative dataset.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 (NGC objects 5001–6000) with columns including: ngc number, object type, apparent magnitude.

Evidence collected
1) Distinct object types and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type";
Result:
- Globular Cluster: 1
- Irregular Galaxy: 2
- Spiral Galaxy: 2

2) All rows with apparent magnitudes (ordered ascending = brighter first)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude"
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
ORDER BY "apparent magnitude" ASC;
Result:
- NGC 5457, Spiral Galaxy, 8.7
- NGC 5466, Globular Cluster, 10.5
- NGC 5474, Spiral Galaxy, 11.9
- NGC 5408, Irregular Galaxy, 14.0
- NGC 5477, Irregular Galaxy, 14.5
Observation: The smallest (brightest) apparent magnitude in this table is 8.7, a Spiral Galaxy (NGC 5457). Both irregular galaxy entries are fainter (higher magnitude values).

3) Per-type brightness statistics
Executed SQL (count, min, max, average):
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count,
       MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_magnitude,
       MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_magnitude,
       AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_magnitude
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type";
Executed SQL (median):
SELECT "object type", PERCENTILE_CONT(0.5) WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY "apparent magnitude") AS median_magnitude
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type";
Results summary:
- Spiral Galaxy (n=2): min 8.7, max 11.9, avg 10.3, median 10.3
- Irregular Galaxy (n=2): min 14.0, max 14.5, avg 14.25, median 14.25
- Globular Cluster (n=1): 10.5 (min=max=avg=median)
Observation: Among galaxy types present, spirals have the lowest (i.e., brightest) minimum, average, and median apparent magnitudes in this dataset.

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (NGC objects 5001–6000), spiral galaxies indeed exhibit the least (smallest) apparent magnitudes compared with the other object types present. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data at hand.
- Important scope note: The dataset is small (only 5 total entries, 2 spirals, 2 irregulars, 1 globular cluster) and limited to a specific NGC range. The conclusion is valid for this dataset; broader generalization would require a more comprehensive catalog.

Assumptions made
- “Least apparent magnitude” is interpreted as the smallest numerical magnitude (brightest), not the faintest.
- Verification scope is limited to the accessible table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000, treated as authoritative within its scope.
