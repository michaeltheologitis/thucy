Claim: “Hong Kong have win 4 more total medal than Thailand for wushu.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Relevant table: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games (contains medal totals by nation for Wushu at the Asian Games)

Table structure (evidence)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'wushu_at_the_asian_games';
- Result summary: columns = rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Medal totals for Hong Kong and Thailand (evidence)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nation, total FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games LIMIT 50;
- Returned rows include:
  - hong kong (hkg) — total = 15
  - thailand (tha) — total = 11

Analysis
- Difference in total medals (Hong Kong − Thailand) = 15 − 11 = 4
- This matches the claim that Hong Kong has 4 more total Wushu medals than Thailand (within this dataset).

Conclusion
- The data supports the statement: Hong Kong has 4 more total Wushu medals than Thailand in the Asian Games Wushu dataset.

Assumptions
- “for wushu” is interpreted as Wushu at the Asian Games (the scope of the available dataset).
- “total medal” refers to the total medals column in the table (aggregate medals across editions captured by this dataset). If a different competition (e.g., World Wushu Championships or SEA Games) was intended, results could differ.
