Claim to verify: "week 9 be on october 30, 1983"

Summary conclusion: The available authoritative data for the 1983 Detroit Lions season shows their Week 9 game took place on October 30, 1983. This supports the claim that Week 9 falls on October 30, 1983.

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season (1983 Detroit Lions season data).

Schema details (via schema inspection):
- Table: public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season
  - week (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - result (text)
  - attendance (bigint)
  - No primary key defined

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM public.t_1983_detroit_lions_season WHERE week = 9;

- Result returned by the database:
  - Date: October 30, 1983
  - Opponent: Chicago Bears
  - Result: W 38 - 17
  - Attendance: 58,764

Interpretation:
- The 1983 Detroit Lions’ Week 9 game occurred on October 30, 1983, indicating that NFL Week 9 aligns with that date.

Assumptions made:
- The phrase "week 9" refers to NFL regular season Week 9 in 1983. I used the Detroit Lions’ schedule as a representative, since NFL week numbering is consistent across teams in a given season.
