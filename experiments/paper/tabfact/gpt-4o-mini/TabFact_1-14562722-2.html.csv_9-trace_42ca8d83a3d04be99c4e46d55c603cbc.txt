Claim assessed: "there be more than 1 disc"

Summary of findings grounded in data:
- The available table (public.my_info_table) includes a column named discs. Each row appears to represent a volume with associated discs and episodes, along with regional release info.
- Evidence shows that every row in the dataset has discs = 1. There are zero rows where discs > 1.

Supporting evidence and executed SQL:
1) Summary statistics on discs
- Result:
  - Total Rows: 5
  - Number of Non-Null Discs: 5
  - Number of Rows Where Discs > 1: 0
  - Minimum Discs: 1
  - Maximum Discs: 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;

  SELECT COUNT(discs) AS non_null_discs FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs IS NOT NULL;

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS rows_with_more_than_one_disc FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs > 1;

  SELECT MIN(discs) AS min_discs FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs IS NOT NULL;

  SELECT MAX(discs) AS max_discs FROM public.my_info_table WHERE discs IS NOT NULL;

2) Row-level inspection
- Result (excerpt of all rows):
  Volume 1: discs=1, episodes=4, region 1=january 31 , 2006; region 2=february 19 , 2007; region 4=march 15 , 2007
  Volume 2: discs=1, episodes=4, region 1=march 28 , 2006; region 2=june 4 , 2007; region 4=july 5 , 2007
  Volume 3: discs=1, episodes=4, region 1=may 30 , 2006; region 2=september 3 , 2007; region 4=march 13 , 2008
  Volume 4: discs=1, episodes=4, region 1=july 18 , 2006; region 2=february 18 , 2008; region 4=june 19 , 2008
  Volume 5: discs=1, episodes=4, region 1=september 19 , 2006; region 2=may 26 , 2008; region 4=march 5 , 2009
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 1", "region 2", "region 4" FROM my_info_table;

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows no instance of a volume having more than one disc. Therefore, interpreted as an existence claim that any item/row has discs > 1, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim to mean: “There exists at least one record in public.my_info_table where discs > 1.” If instead the intent was “The total number of discs across all records is greater than 1,” that would be true (sum(discs) = 5). However, the per-record interpretation aligns with the table’s schema and typical usage of a discs field per volume.
