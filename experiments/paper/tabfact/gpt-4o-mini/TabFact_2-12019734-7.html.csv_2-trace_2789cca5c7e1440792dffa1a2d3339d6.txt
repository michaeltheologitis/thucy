Claim interpreted: “When the record is 11 - 32 - 11, the score is 7 - 2.” I verify whether there exists a row in the available data where the record equals 11 - 32 - 11 and the score equals 7 - 2, and whether other scores exist for that same record.

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, public schema
- Table: public.my_info_table
- Columns (all text): date, visitor, score, home, record

Evidence
1) Find rows where record equals exactly '11 - 32 - 11'
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record FROM public.my_info_table WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11';
Result:
- Date: February 3; Visitor: NY Islanders; Home: New Jersey; Score: 7 - 2; Record: 11 - 32 - 11

2) Pattern search for robustness (allowing spaces around dashes)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE record ~ ' ?11 ?- ?32 ?- ?11 ?';
Result:
- Date: February 3; Visitor: NY Islanders; Home: New Jersey; Score: 7 - 2; Record: 11 - 32 - 11

3) Confirm a row exists where both the record and score match exactly; also list details
SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM my_info_table
WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11' AND score = '7 - 2';
Result: 1 row

SQL executed (details):
SELECT date, visitor, home 
FROM my_info_table
WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11' AND score = '7 - 2';
Result: Date = February 3; Visitor = NY Islanders; Home = New Jersey

4) Check whether any other scores appear for record = '11 - 32 - 11'
SQL executed:
SELECT score, COUNT(*) 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE record = '11 - 32 - 11' 
GROUP BY score;
Result:
- Score: 7 - 2; Count: 1

Conclusion
- There is a recorded instance where the record is exactly '11 - 32 - 11' and the score is exactly '7 - 2'. No other score values are present for that record in the dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement as an existence claim in the available dataset (i.e., at least one occurrence where record = 11 - 32 - 11 and score = 7 - 2), not as a universal rule across all possible contexts.
