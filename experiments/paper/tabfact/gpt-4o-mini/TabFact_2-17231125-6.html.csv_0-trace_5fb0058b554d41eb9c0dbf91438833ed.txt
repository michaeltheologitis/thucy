Claim to verify: “player larry mize and d a be tie for 5th place.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table: t_1988_u_s_open_golf (1988 U.S. Open Golf tournament results).
- Table columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1988_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place, player;
   Key relevant rows in the result:
   - place: t5, player: D A Weibring, country: United States, score: 71 + 69 + 68 = 208, to par: - 5
   - place: t5, player: Larry Mize, country: United States, score: 69 + 67 + 72 = 208, to par: - 5
   (This output shows both Larry Mize and D A Weibring listed with place t5, i.e., tied for 5th.)

2) SQL: SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM t_1988_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(place) LIKE 't5%' OR place = '5';
   Result:
   - Larry Mize — place: t5; score: 69 + 67 + 72 = 208; to par: -5
   - D. A. Weibring — place: t5; score: 71 + 69 + 68 = 208; to par: -5

Conclusion
- The 1988 U.S. Open data shows Larry Mize and D. A. Weibring tied for 5th place (both listed as t5).

Assumptions
- The phrase “d a be” refers to D. A. Weibring (a common PGA Tour player of that era) and the claim pertains to the 1988 U.S. Open Golf tournament, which is the available dataset.
