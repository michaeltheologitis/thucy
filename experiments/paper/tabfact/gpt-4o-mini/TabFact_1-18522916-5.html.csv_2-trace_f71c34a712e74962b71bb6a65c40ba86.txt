Claim to verify: “daniel uberti be sack on dec 29 2008 and nelson ancheta be appoint manager the same day.”

Summary of findings:
- The Primera División (Apertura 2008) management table shows a record for team Nejapa where:
  - Outgoing manager: Daniel Uberti
  - Manner of departure: Sacked
  - Date of vacancy: 29 December 2008
  - Replaced by: Nelson Ancheta
  - Date of appointment: 29 December 2008
- This directly supports both parts of the claim: Uberti was sacked on Dec 29, 2008, and Ancheta was appointed the same day.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) Broad search for the relevant managers (used to locate all relevant rows)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 
WHERE LOWER("outgoing manager") LIKE '%uberti%' 
   OR LOWER("replaced by") LIKE '%uberti%' 
   OR LOWER("outgoing manager") LIKE '%ancheta%' 
   OR LOWER("replaced by") LIKE '%ancheta%';

Returned relevant rows (excerpt):
- Team: Nejapa | Outgoing Manager: Daniel Uberti | Manner of Departure: Sacked | Date of Vacancy: 29 December 2008 | Replaced By: Nelson Ancheta | Date of Appointment: 29 December 2008 | Position in Table: Post - Season (10th)
- (Also found contextual rows such as FAS with outgoing manager Nelson Ancheta earlier on 27 December 2008, but the Nejapa row is the direct evidence for this claim.)

2) Targeted verification for Nejapa and the specific managers
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.primera_divisi_n_de_f_tbol_profesional_apertura_2008 
WHERE lower(team) LIKE '%nejapa%' 
AND (lower("outgoing manager") LIKE '%daniel%' OR lower("outgoing manager") LIKE '%uberti%') 
AND (lower("replaced by") LIKE '%nelson%' OR lower("replaced by") LIKE '%ancheta%');

Result: One row found confirming:
- Team: Nejapa | Outgoing Manager: Daniel Uberti | Manner of Departure: Sacked | Date of Vacancy: 29 December 2008 | Replaced By: Nelson Ancheta | Date of Appointment: 29 December 2008 | Position in Table: Post-season (10th)

Conclusion:
- The data shows Daniel Uberti was sacked on 29 December 2008 and Nelson Ancheta was appointed manager the same day (for Nejapa). The claim is supported.

Assumptions made:
- “be sack” is interpreted as “Manner of departure: Sacked,” with the “date of vacancy” representing the sacking date.
- “appoint manager” is interpreted as the “replaced by” manager with the corresponding “date of appointment.”
- “Dec 29 2008” equals “29 December 2008.”
