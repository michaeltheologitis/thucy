Summary of findings:
- The available data source (TabFact) contains one relevant table: public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix with columns: driver, constructor, laps, "time / retired", grid.
- Interpreting the request as: find the minimum laps ("least lap") for Christian Danner when grid is 5 or 43 in this table.
- Results show Christian Danner does not appear in this race table. Grid value 43 does not exist in this dataset (grid ranges from 1 to 26). The only row with grid=5 is Michele Alboreto with 43 laps (retired: Engine).
- Therefore, there is no recorded value for Christian Danner at grid 5 or 43 in this dataset; the “least lap” under those conditions is not applicable (null).

Executed SQL evidence and results:
1) Check grid range
SQL:
SELECT MIN(grid) AS min_grid FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix;
Result: min_grid = 1

SQL:
SELECT MAX(grid) AS max_grid FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix;
Result: max_grid = 26

2) Rows where grid is 5 or 43
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE grid IN (5, 43);
Result:
- driver: michele alboreto | constructor: ferrari | laps: 43 | time / retired: engine | grid: 5
(No rows with grid = 43)

3) Presence of Christian Danner in the table
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix WHERE driver = 'Christian Danner';
Result: No rows

4) Minimum laps for Christian Danner when grid IN (5, 43)
SQL:
SELECT MIN(laps) AS min_laps 
FROM public.t_1987_hungarian_grand_prix 
WHERE driver = 'Christian Danner' AND grid IN (5, 43);
Result: min_laps = null (no matching rows)

Conclusion:
- There is no data for Christian Danner at grid positions 5 or 43 in the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix table, so the “least lap” under those conditions cannot be determined from this dataset.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguity):
- “Least lap” was interpreted as the minimum value of the laps column.
- “When the grid be 5, be 43” was interpreted as filtering rows where grid IN (5, 43).
- Scope is limited to the available TabFact dataset for the 1987 Hungarian Grand Prix only.
