Claim interpreted: For the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team, in any game they won, they never scored more than 7 points.

Data source explored
- Database: public
- Table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
- Relevant columns: date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "wildcats points" (bigint), opponents (bigint)
- Win definition used: a game is a win if "wildcats points" > opponents.

Evidence 1: Total wins and maximum points in wins
- Finding: The team had 7 wins; the maximum points scored in those wins was 36.
- Executed SQL (wins count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_wins
  FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
  WHERE "wildcats points" > opponents;
  Result: 7 wins
- Executed SQL (max points in wins):
  SELECT MAX("wildcats points") AS max_wildcats_points
  FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team
  WHERE "wildcats points" > opponents;
  Result: 36 points

Evidence 2: List of wins with more than 7 points
- Finding: The team won multiple games scoring more than 7 points (e.g., 20, 26, 14, 15, 36).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, "wildcats points", opponents, result 
  FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team 
  WHERE "wildcats points" > opponents 
  AND "wildcats points" > 7 
  ORDER BY date;
- Returned examples include:
  - Sep 27: Cincinnati (20–0)
  - Oct 4: Xavier (20–7)
  - Oct 11: 9 Georgia (26–0)
  - Oct 18: 10 Vanderbilt (14–0)
  - Nov 8: West Virginia (15–6)
  - Nov 15: Evansville (36–0)

Conclusion
- The data shows several wins with the Wildcats scoring more than 7 points (maximum 36). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “the wildcat” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team for the 1947 season (the available dataset).
- “any game they win” refers to games in that 1947 season.
- A win is defined as "wildcats points" > opponents, independent of the text in the result column.
