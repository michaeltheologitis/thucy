Claim to verify: “Proteus mirabilis has a positive Voges–Proskauer reading.”

Summary conclusion: The data show Proteus mirabilis is Voges–Proskauer negative, contradicting the claim.

Data sources explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public, table: imvic (IMViC test results with columns: species, indole, methyl red, voges - proskauer, citrate).

Evidence from executed SQL queries
1) Query: Retrieve the VP result specifically for Proteus mirabilis
SQL executed:
SELECT species, "voges - proskauer"
FROM imvic
WHERE LOWER(species) = LOWER('Proteus mirabilis');

Result:
- species: proteus mirabilis
- voges - proskauer: negative

2) Query: Cross-check all Proteus entries and their VP results
SQL executed:
SELECT species, "voges - proskauer"
FROM imvic
WHERE species ILIKE '%proteus%';

Results:
- species: proteus vulgaris | voges - proskauer: negative
- species: proteus mirabilis | voges - proskauer: negative

Assessment
- Both targeted and broader queries indicate Proteus mirabilis is Voges–Proskauer negative, not positive. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Voges–Proskauer reading” refers to the VP test result captured in the imvic table’s "voges - proskauer" column.
- “Proteus mirabilis” refers to the species entry matching that name in the imvic dataset.
