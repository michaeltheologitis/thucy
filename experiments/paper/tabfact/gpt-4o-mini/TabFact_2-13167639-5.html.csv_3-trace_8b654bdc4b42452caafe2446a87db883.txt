Schema inspected
- Columns: date (text), round (text), opponents (text), "result f - a" (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence
1) Sample rows to understand date format
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season LIMIT 10;

Result:
- 7 January 2003 | 62,740

3) Direct check: Was attendance on 7 January > 70,000?
SQL executed:
SELECT date, attendance, attendance > 70000 AS over_70k
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '7 january%';
