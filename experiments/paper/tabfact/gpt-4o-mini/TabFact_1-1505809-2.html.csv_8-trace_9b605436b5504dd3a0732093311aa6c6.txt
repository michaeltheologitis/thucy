Claim interpreted: “46 be the value of end(s) lost when blank end(s) be 9.” Using the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier dataset, I interpret “end(s) lost” as the column "ends lost" and “blank end(s)” as the column "blank ends" in table public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier.

Evidence 1: Find rows where blank ends = 9 and read ends lost.
Executed SQL:
SELECT locale, skip, "ends lost", "blank ends"
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "blank ends" = 9;
Result:
- locale: northern ontario | skip: mike jakubo | ends lost: 48 | blank ends: 9
Interpretation: When blank ends = 9, the corresponding ends lost is 48 (not 46).

Evidence 2 (cross-check): Find any row with ends lost = 46 and see its blank ends.
Executed SQL:
SELECT locale, skip, "ends lost", "blank ends"
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "ends lost" = 46;
Result:
- locale: Ontario | skip: Wayne Middaugh | ends lost: 46 | blank ends: 10
Interpretation: A team with 46 ends lost had 10 blank ends, not 9.

Conclusion: The statement that the value of ends lost is 46 when blank ends is 9 is contradicted by the data; the correct ends lost value for blank ends = 9 is 48.

Assumptions:
- “end lost” refers to the “ends lost” statistic, and “blank end” refers to the “blank ends” statistic in the public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier table.
