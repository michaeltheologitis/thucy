Claim interpreted: “the score for air force - navy have all be decide up until 2018.” I interpret this as: all Air Force–Navy game scores are present (i.e., recorded/decided) for seasons up to and including 2018 in the available Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy dataset.

Findings:
- The dataset spans seasons 1972 through 2018 (44 seasons total).
- For every season in this range, the “air force - navy score” field is present (non-null and non-empty).
- Therefore, within this dataset, all Air Force–Navy scores are recorded up to and including 2018.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count seasons, min, and max season year
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS number_of_seasons, MIN(season) AS min_season_year, MAX(season) AS max_season_year
FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy;
Result: number_of_seasons = 44, min_season_year = 1972, max_season_year = 2018

2) Count of non-null Air Force–Navy scores
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS non_null_air_force_navy_score_count
FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy
WHERE "air force - navy score" IS NOT NULL;
Result: non_null_air_force_navy_score_count = 44

3) Count of null or empty Air Force–Navy scores up to and including 2018
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_or_empty_air_force_navy_score_count
FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy
WHERE ("air force - navy score" IS NULL OR "air force - navy score" = '') AND season <= 2018;
Result: null_or_empty_air_force_navy_score_count = 0

4) Sample of score formatting (to confirm scores are recorded as numeric results)
SQL:
SELECT season, "air force - navy score" FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy LIMIT 10;
Sample Results:
1972 | 21 - 17
1973 | 42 - 6
1974 | 19 - 16
1975 | 17 - 0
1976 | 13 - 3
1977 | 10 - 7
1978 | 37 - 8
1979 | 13 - 9
1980 | 21 - 20
1981 | 30 - 13

Conclusion:
- The data shows that all Air Force–Navy scores are recorded for seasons through 2018. This supports the claim under the interpretation that “decide” means “recorded/available.”

Assumptions made:
- “Have all be decide” is interpreted as “all have been recorded” (i.e., no missing scores). The claim does not appear to ask whether games ended without ties or about margins of victory; if that was the intent, please note that the verification here is strictly about completeness/availability of scores up to 2018 in the dataset.
