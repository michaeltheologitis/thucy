Claim to verify: “At Auckland, New Zealand on October 10, 2004, the playing surface was hard.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.ji_nov_k with columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Evidence collected (with executed SQL)
1) Check all entries mentioning Auckland
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score FROM ji_nov_k WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Auckland%';
Result:
- Date: January 14, 1996; Tournament: Auckland, New Zealand; Surface: Hard; Opponent: Brett Steven; Score: 6 - 4, 6 - 4

2) Check for an entry exactly on October 10, 2004
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score FROM ji_nov_k WHERE date = 'October 10, 2004';
Result: No rows returned

3) Find all entries in 2004 (to locate what occurred on October 10, 2004)
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface
FROM ji_nov_k
WHERE date LIKE '%2004%';
Results:
- Date: October 10, 2004; Tournament: Tokyo, Japan; Surface: Hard
- Date: November 3, 2004; Tournament: Basel, Switzerland; Surface: Carpet (i)

4) Specifically check for Auckland entries in 2004
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface FROM ji_nov_k WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Auckland%' AND date ILIKE '%2004%';
Result: No rows returned

5) Confirm the October 10, 2004 entry is Tokyo
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface FROM ji_nov_k WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Tokyo%';
Result:
- Date: October 10, 2004; Tournament: Tokyo, Japan; Surface: Hard

Assessment
- The database has an Auckland, New Zealand entry, but it is on January 14, 1996, and the surface is Hard.
- For the date October 10, 2004, the recorded tournament is Tokyo, Japan (surface Hard), not Auckland, New Zealand.
- There are no records showing an Auckland tournament on October 10, 2004 in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The specific claim tying Auckland, New Zealand to the date October 10, 2004 is not supported by the data. While Auckland entries show a Hard surface (at least for 1996), the only October 10, 2004 match in the dataset occurred in Tokyo on Hard courts. Therefore, the claim as stated (location + date + surface) is not supported.

Assumptions
- “Playing surface” refers to the “surface” column in the ji_nov_k table.
- “At Auckland, New Zealand” corresponds to tournament values that mention “Auckland, New Zealand.”
- Dates are interpreted as stored text in the date column; variations in whitespace/casing were accounted for using LIKE/ILIKE where needed.
