Summary
- Claim evaluated: “the score be 1 - 0 when the home team be shrewsbury town.”
- Context: Verified against the available TabFact database (public.t_1990_91_fa_cup), which contains FA Cup 1990–91 fixtures/results.

Data source and schema
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1990_91_fa_cup
- Columns (all text): "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date"

Evidence gathered
1) Locate matches where the home team is Shrewsbury Town (case-insensitive)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "tie no", "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%shrewsbury%';
- Result:
  - tie no: 6
  - home team: Shrewsbury Town
  - score: 1 - 0
  - away team: Wimbledon
  - date: 26 / 01 / 1991

2) Verify whether all Shrewsbury Town home entries (if more than one) share the same score; count by score and list rows
- Executed SQL (count by score):
  SELECT score, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE LOWER("home team") = 'shrewsbury town' GROUP BY score;
- Result: one row — score: 1 - 0, count: 1

- Executed SQL (list all such rows):
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE LOWER("home team") = 'shrewsbury town';
- Result: one row — tie no 6, Shrewsbury Town vs Wimbledon, score 1 - 0, date 26 / 01 / 1991

Conclusion
- The dataset records a match where Shrewsbury Town was the home team and the score was 1 - 0 (vs Wimbledon on 26/01/1991). This supports the claim within the scope of the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted relative to the accessible dataset (FA Cup 1990–91 only), not as a universal statement across all competitions or seasons.
- The phrasing is taken to assert the existence of such a match (home team Shrewsbury Town with score 1 - 0), not that every Shrewsbury Town home match ends 1 - 0.
