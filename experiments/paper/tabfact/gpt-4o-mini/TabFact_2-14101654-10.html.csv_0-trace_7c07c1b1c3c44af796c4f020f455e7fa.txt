Scope and data sources explored
- Discovered available data: TabFact database with schema public containing table t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season.
- Relevant columns: round, player, position, nationality, "college / junior / club team (league)".

Verification steps and evidence
1) Identify all nationalities present in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT nationality, COUNT(*) AS count_per_nationality 
FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season 
GROUP BY nationality;

Result:
- Canada: 5
- Slovakia: 1
- United States: 5

2) Verify whether any non–North American nationalities appear besides Slovakia
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT nationality, COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season
WHERE nationality NOT IN ('Canada', 'United States')
GROUP BY nationality;

Result:
- Slovakia: 1

Conclusion
- The only nationalities present are Canada, United States (both North America), and Slovakia. Thus, except for Slovakia, all other countries are from North America. The claim is supported by the data in this table.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the nationality values in public.t_2004_05_philadelphia_flyers_season.
- Considered North America to include at least Canada and the United States; no other North American countries appear in the data.
