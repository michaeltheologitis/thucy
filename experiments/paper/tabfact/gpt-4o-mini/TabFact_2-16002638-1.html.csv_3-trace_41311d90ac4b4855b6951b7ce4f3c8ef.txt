Claim interpreted: “The Dundee Hurricanes won the same number of games in 2003 and 2004.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, public schema
- Relevant table: public.dundee_hurricanes
- Columns: season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), "final position" (text), notes (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve wins for 2003 and 2004
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, wins FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season IN (2003, 2004);
Result (summarized):
- Season 2003: 6 wins
- Season 2004: 6 wins

2) Direct equality check of wins between 2003 and 2004
Executed SQL:
SELECT (SELECT wins FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2003) = (SELECT wins FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2004) AS are_equal;
Result (summarized): are_equal = true

3) Validate one record per season (to ensure no duplicates)
Executed SQL:
SELECT season, COUNT(*) AS record_count
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
WHERE season IN (2003, 2004)
GROUP BY season;
Result (summarized):
- 2003: 1 record
- 2004: 1 record

Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season
FROM public.dundee_hurricanes
WHERE season IN (2003, 2004);
Result (summarized): 2003, 2004

Conclusion:
- The Dundee Hurricanes recorded 6 wins in 2003 and 6 wins in 2004. The equality check confirms they won the same number of games in both seasons.

Assumptions:
- “Season” corresponds to the 2003 and 2004 seasons as stored in the season column.
- Each season is represented by a single aggregate record (validated above).
