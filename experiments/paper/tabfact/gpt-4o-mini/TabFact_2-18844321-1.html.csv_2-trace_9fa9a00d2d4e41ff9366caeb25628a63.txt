Data sources explored
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland (columns: opposing team [text], against [bigint], date [text], venue [text], status [text])

What the data contains
- This table records matches from New Zealand’s 1978 rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland. The column “opposing team” is New Zealand’s opponent; the column “against” is the number of points scored by that opponent (i.e., points scored against New Zealand).

Evidence gathered
1) Distinct opposing teams (to confirm Cambridge University appears)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "opposing team" FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland;
Result excerpt includes: Cambridge University (among others)

2) All matches with opposing team and points “against” (ordered by date)
SQL:
SELECT "opposing team", "against", "date" 
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
ORDER BY "date";
Relevant rows from result:
- 18 October 1978 — Cambridge University — Against Points: 12
- 28 October 1978 — London Counties — Against Points: 12
- 31 October 1978 — Munster — Against Points: 12
- 11 November 1978 — Wales — Against Points: 12

3) Count of opponents who scored exactly 12 points (against New Zealand)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_opposing_teams 
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
WHERE "against" = 12;
Result: 4

4) List of opponents who scored exactly 12 points (against New Zealand)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "opposing team" 
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland 
WHERE "against" = 12;
Result: Cambridge University; London Counties; Munster; Wales

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “there be 4 team that score exactly 12 against cambridge university.”
- The available dataset tracks points scored against New Zealand, not points scored against Cambridge University. It shows that four teams (Cambridge University, London Counties, Munster, Wales) each scored exactly 12 points against New Zealand. It does not provide data about teams scoring against Cambridge University in matches where Cambridge University was the opponent.
- Therefore, as written (about scoring against Cambridge University), the claim is not supported by the data. However, there are indeed four teams that scored exactly 12 points against New Zealand, one of which is Cambridge University.

Assumptions noted
- I interpret the user’s intent could have been to refer to teams scoring exactly 12 against New Zealand on the 1978 tour, with Cambridge University being one of those teams. The dataset does not allow verification of teams scoring against Cambridge University as an opponent.
