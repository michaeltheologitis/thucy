Claim: “suki to ietara iinoni have the 2nd most recent broadcast date.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table tsuki_no_koibito.
- Relevant columns: "romanized title" (text), "broadcast date" (text). Dates are stored as text like “June 7, 2010”.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Establish the correct descending order of broadcast dates by parsing the text dates, and assign ranks (1 = most recent):
SQL:
SELECT "romanized title", "broadcast date",
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC) AS rank
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
ORDER BY TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC;

Result (excerpt showing full set):
- Rank 1 | saishūshōjomakuwakare | June 14, 2010
- Rank 2 | suki to ietara iinoni | June 7, 2010
- Rank 3 | konna ni suki dattanda… | May 31, 2010
- Rank 4 | fukusyū no puropōzu | May 24, 2010
- Rank 5 | arienai kisu | May 17, 2010
- Rank 6 | omae ga hosii | May 10, 2010

2) Independently confirm the rank of the specific title across the entire table using a CTE (compute ranks first, then filter):
SQL:
WITH RankedTitles AS (
    SELECT "romanized title",
           "broadcast date",
           RANK() OVER (ORDER BY TO_DATE("broadcast date", 'Month DD, YYYY') DESC) AS rank
    FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito
)
SELECT *
FROM RankedTitles
WHERE "romanized title" = 'suki to ietara iinoni';

Result:
- romanized title: suki to ietara iinoni | broadcast date: June 7, 2010 | rank: 2

Conclusion
- The title “suki to ietara iinoni” has the 2nd most recent broadcast date in the tsuki_no_koibito table. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “suki to ietara iinoni” refers to the value in the column "romanized title" in public.tsuki_no_koibito.
- “2nd most recent” is interpreted as 2nd latest by broadcast date among the entries present in this table only.
