Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and focused on the table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix (1971 South African Grand Prix).
- Inspected the table schema to understand which fields capture laps completed and finish status/time.
- Queried all drivers with laps < 75 to verify whether they have listed finish times or retirement reasons.
- Queried the race’s maximum laps and drivers with laps ≥ 75 to understand classification and time/gap recording.
- Aggregated retirement reasons for drivers with laps < 75 to assess whether issues were mechanical (“car trouble”) or otherwise.

Data source discovery
The accessible data source is a PostgreSQL database containing the table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.

Schema inspection (evidence)
- Columns discovered: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint). No primary key.
SQL executed:
1) List columns
SELECT column_name, data_type, ordinal_position
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 't_1971_south_african_grand_prix';

2) Check primary key
SELECT kcu.column_name
FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
ON kcu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
WHERE tc.table_name = 't_1971_south_african_grand_prix' AND tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY';

Evidence: drivers with laps < 75
- All drivers with laps < 75 have a retirement reason in the time / retired column (no race times listed). The reasons include engine, gearbox, overheating, differential, suspension, fuel leak, accident, and physical.
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired" 
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE laps < 75;

Results summary (laps < 75):
- 12 drivers: all have retirement reasons, not finish times.
- Reasons breakdown (counts):
  • engine: 4
  • overheating: 2
  • gearbox: 1
  • differential: 1
  • suspension: 1
  • fuel leak: 1
  • accident: 1
  • physical: 1
SQL executed for breakdown:
SELECT "time / retired", COUNT(*) AS driver_count 
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix
WHERE laps < 75
GROUP BY "time / retired";

Evidence: maximum laps and laps ≥ 75
- The race maximum laps completed = 79.
- Drivers with laps ≥ 75 have time/gap entries (e.g., 1:47:35.5, + 20.9, + 1 lap, + 2 laps, + 1:09.4) rather than retirement reasons.
SQL executed:
1) Max laps
SELECT MAX(laps) AS max_laps FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;

2) Drivers with laps ≥ 75
SELECT driver, laps, "time / retired", CASE WHEN "time / retired" NOT LIKE '%:%' THEN 'Flag' END AS flag 
FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE laps >= 75;

Assessment of the claim
- “Any driver below 75 lap … thus no time list”: Verified. In this dataset, every driver with fewer than 75 laps has no finish time recorded; instead, a retirement reason is listed in time / retired.
- “… car trouble of some kind …”: Partly accurate. Most sub-75-lap retirements were mechanical (engine, gearbox, overheating, differential, suspension, fuel leak). However, at least two reasons are non-mechanical: accident and physical. Therefore, it is not true that all such retirements were due to “car trouble.”

Conclusion
- The core of the statement—drivers with fewer than 75 laps have no finish time listed because they encountered issues—is supported by the data.
- The specific characterization that all such cases were “car trouble” is not fully accurate; some were non-mechanical (accident, physical).

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the available dataset: the 1971 South African Grand Prix results in public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.
- Interpreted “no time list” as the absence of a race time in the time / retired field, replaced by a retirement reason.
- Interpreted “car trouble” as mechanical failures/issues (engine, gearbox, overheating, etc.).
