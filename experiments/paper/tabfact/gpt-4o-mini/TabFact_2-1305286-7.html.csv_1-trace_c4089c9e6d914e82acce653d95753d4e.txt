Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.nickelodeon_movies WHERE film ILIKE '%Rugrats%';
Result (relevant row excerpt):

- Year: 2004
- Category: Favorite Voice from an Animated Movie
- Winner/Nominee(s): Bruce Willis
- Result: Nominated

2) Targeted confirmation for Bruce Willis and Rugrats Go Wild
Executed SQL:
