Claim to verify: “Pádraig Harrington [is] the only player from Northern Ireland.”

Data source explored
- Discovered dataset: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf (2006 U.S. Open Golf participants; columns: place, player, country, score, to par)

Evidence
1) Pádraig Harrington’s listed country in the dataset
- SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Harrington%';
- Result:
  Pádraig Harrington — Ireland

2) Presence of players from Northern Ireland in the same dataset
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT player, country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE country ILIKE '%Ireland%' ORDER BY country, player;
- Results:
  Pádraig Harrington — Ireland
  Graeme McDowell — Northern Ireland

3) Valid country values include “Northern Ireland”
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY country ASC;
- Result (excerpt):
  … Ireland; Northern Ireland; …

Assessment
- The data shows Pádraig Harrington is from Ireland (Republic of Ireland), not Northern Ireland.
- The dataset includes at least one player actually from Northern Ireland (Graeme McDowell). Therefore, Harrington cannot be “the only player from Northern Ireland.”

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available dataset (2006 U.S. Open participants) and treated the “country” field as the player’s home country designation.
