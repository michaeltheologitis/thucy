Claim interpreted: “the only person to have a status of ‘alive after exist in the cube’ be male.” Based on the dataset, we interpret “exist” as “exiting,” i.e., status value: “alive after exiting the cube.”

Data source explored
- Available database: Cube film series dataset
- Table: cube_film_series(name text, occupation text, gender text, "prison connection" text, "played by" text, status text)

Evidence 1: Distinct status values and counts
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT status, COUNT(*) AS character_count FROM cube_film_series GROUP BY status;
Result:
- status: dead | character_count: 5
- status: alive after exiting the cube | character_count: 1

Evidence 2: Identity and gender of the character with the status “alive after exiting the cube”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, gender FROM cube_film_series WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result:
- name: Kazan | gender: Male

Conclusion
- There is exactly one person with status “alive after exiting the cube,” and that person (Kazan) is male. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “alive after exist in the cube” is taken to mean the explicit status string in the dataset: “alive after exiting the cube.”
