Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and schema.
- Queried the dataset for (a) Joachim Hansen’s fight(s) at DREAM 11, (b) any fight(s) vs Caol Uno, and (c) whether any fight vs Caol Uno had a time of 5:00.

Available data sources
- PostgreSQL database with a single table in public schema: joachim_hansen_fighter
- Table columns: res (text), record (text), opponent (text), method (text), event (text), round (text), time (text), location (text)

Evidence
1) Hansen at DREAM 11
- Finding: Hansen fought Shinya Aoki at DREAM 11, losing by submission (armbar) at 4:56 of Round 2 in Yokohama, Japan.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT event, opponent, res AS result, method, round, time, location 
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter 
WHERE event ILIKE '%DREAM 11%';
- Result excerpt:
  • Event: DREAM 11
  • Opponent: Shinya Aoki
  • Result: Loss
  • Method: Submission (armbar)
  • Round: 2
  • Time: 4:56
  • Location: Yokohama, Japan

2) Any fight vs Caol Uno
- Finding: Hansen fought Caol Uno at an event labeled “deep - 13,” winning by KO (knee) at 4:48 of Round 3 in Saitama, Japan—not at DREAM 11.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT event, opponent, res, method, round, time, location 
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Caol Uno%';
- Result excerpt:
  • Event: deep - 13
  • Opponent: caol uno
  • Result: win
  • Method: ko (knee)
  • Round: 3
  • Time: 4:48
  • Location: saitama, saitama, japan

3) Any fight vs Caol Uno with time exactly 5:00
- Finding: No fights vs Caol Uno recorded with a time of 5:00.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * 
FROM public.joachim_hansen_fighter 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Caol Uno%' AND time = '5:00';
- Result: No rows returned

Assessment of the claim
- “dream 11 be the event at 5:00 with the opponent of caol uno” interpreted as asserting that the relevant event is DREAM 11, that the time associated is 5:00, and that the opponent is Caol Uno.
- Data shows DREAM 11 opponent was Shinya Aoki and the time was 4:56 (Round 2), not 5:00. Hansen’s fight vs Caol Uno occurred at a different event (deep - 13) and at 4:48 of Round 3, not 5:00.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement as a verification-style claim about Joachim Hansen’s fight details: specifically tying DREAM 11, a time of 5:00, and opponent Caol Uno to the same bout.
- Treated the provided database as authoritative for Joachim Hansen’s professional fight record details.
