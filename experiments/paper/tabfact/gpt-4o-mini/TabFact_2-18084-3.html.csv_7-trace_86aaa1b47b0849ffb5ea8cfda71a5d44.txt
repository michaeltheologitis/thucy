Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret “4 athlete have a mark of 28 foot” as asserting that four athletes in the available long jump dataset have a recorded performance whose feet-and-inches component shows 28 feet (i.e., marks formatted like “(28ft...)”). I also tested the stricter interpretation of exactly 28 ft 0 in.

Data sources explored
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: long_jump
- Schema (from inspection): columns = mark (TEXT), wind (DOUBLE PRECISION), athlete (TEXT), nationality (TEXT), venue (TEXT), date (TEXT). The mark field stores distance in meters followed by a parenthetical feet-and-inches equivalent, e.g., “8.74 m (28ft8in)”.

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Count of rows and distinct athletes with a 28‑feet entry (any inches)
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows, COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athletes FROM long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft%'
- Result: total_rows = 6, distinct_athletes = 6

2) Count of rows and distinct athletes with exactly 28 ft 0 in
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft0in)%';
- Result: total_rows = 0
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS distinct_athletes FROM long_jump WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft0in)%';
- Result: distinct_athletes = 0

3) Which athletes have 28‑feet marks (any inches)
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT athlete, mark 
  FROM public.long_jump 
  WHERE mark LIKE '%(28ft%' 
  ORDER BY mark DESC;
- Result:
  • Erick Walder — 8.74 m (28ft8in) a
  • Dwight Phillips — 8.74 m (28ft8in)
  • Larry Myricks — 8.74 m (28ft8in)
  • Irving Saladino — 8.73 m (28ft7½in)
  • Iván Pedroso — 8.71 m (28ft6¾in)
  • Loúis Tsátoumas — 8.66 m (28ft4¾in)

Conclusion
- Under the broader interpretation (“28 feet” meaning any mark whose feet component starts with 28ft), the data show 6 distinct athletes, not 4.
- Under the strict interpretation (exactly 28 ft 0 in), the data show 0 athletes.
- Therefore, the claim that “4 athlete have a mark of 28 foot” is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made
- “28 foot” refers to the feet-and-inches representation embedded in the mark text (the substring in parentheses), not the metric value.
- Distinct athletes are counted by the athlete name column.
- Verification is limited to the accessible public.long_jump dataset, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
