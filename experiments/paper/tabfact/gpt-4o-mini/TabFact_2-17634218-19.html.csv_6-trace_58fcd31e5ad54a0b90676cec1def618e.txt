Claim to verify: “takamiyama have the shortest time range between his first and last record, 13 year.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_sumo_record_holders (columns: name text, total bigint, first text, last text, highest rank text)

Step 1: Locate Takamiyama’s entry and his first/last dates
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, total, first, last, "highest rank" FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders WHERE name ILIKE '%takamiyama%';
- Result:
  name = takamiyama; total = 27; first = "november 1969"; last = "september 1982"; highest rank = "sekiwake".

Step 2: Compute Takamiyama’s span between first and last
- SQL executed:
  SELECT age(to_date('september 1982', 'FMMonth YYYY')::date, to_date('november 1969', 'FMMonth YYYY')::date) AS age_difference;
- Result: 12 years 10 months (equivalent to 154 months)

Step 3: Determine the minimum span across all record holders
- SQL executed (smallest 10 spans, showing context):
  SELECT name,
         to_date(initcap(first), 'FMMonth YYYY') AS first_date,
         to_date(initcap(last),  'FMMonth YYYY') AS last_date,
         age(to_date(initcap(last), 'FMMonth YYYY'), to_date(initcap(first), 'FMMonth YYYY')) AS age_diff,
         EXTRACT(YEAR FROM age(to_date(initcap(last), 'FMMonth YYYY'), to_date(initcap(first), 'FMMonth YYYY')))  AS years_diff,
         EXTRACT(MONTH FROM age(to_date(initcap(last), 'FMMonth YYYY'), to_date(initcap(first), 'FMMonth YYYY'))) AS months_diff
  FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  ORDER BY years_diff, months_diff
  LIMIT 10;
- Sample of returned minima (name, first_date, last_date, span):
  - daikirin: Nov 1966 → Sep 1970 = 3 years 10 months
  - wakanosato: Nov 2000 → Sep 2005 = 4 years 10 months
  - kisenosato: Jul 2006 → Sep 2011 = 5 years 2 months
  (All shorter than Takamiyama’s 12 years 10 months)

- SQL executed (global minimum):
  SELECT name,
         TO_DATE(first, 'FMMonth YYYY') AS first_date,
         TO_DATE(last,  'FMMonth YYYY') AS last_date,
         AGE(TO_DATE(last, 'FMMonth YYYY'), TO_DATE(first, 'FMMonth YYYY')) AS span
  FROM public.list_of_sumo_record_holders
  WHERE first IS NOT NULL AND last IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY span
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: daikirin; first = November 1966; last = September 1970; span = 3 years 10 months

Findings
- Takamiyama’s first-to-last span is 12 years 10 months, not 13 years exactly.
- Multiple record holders (e.g., Daikirin) have significantly shorter spans than Takamiyama. Therefore, Takamiyama does not have the shortest time range between first and last record in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Takamiyama does not have the shortest span, and his span is not exactly 13 years (it is 12 years 10 months).

Assumptions
- “Record” refers to entries in the table public.list_of_sumo_record_holders, and “first”/“last” denote the first and last month-year values recorded for each holder. Spans are computed as the interval between these parsed dates.
