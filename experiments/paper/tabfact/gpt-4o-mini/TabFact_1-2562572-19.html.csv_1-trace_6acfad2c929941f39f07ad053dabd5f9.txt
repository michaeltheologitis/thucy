Conclusion: The settlement of Lok is classified as a village in the authoritative Vojvodina settlements dataset.

Data source context: TabFact database (public schema) containing the table list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina, which lists settlements across Vojvodina with their types and related attributes.

Evidence and executed SQL:
- Result: Settlement Name = Lok; Cyrillic Name = лок; Type = Village
- Executed SQL:
SELECT settlement, "cyrillic name", type FROM list_of_cities_towns_and_villages_in_vojvodina WHERE settlement ILIKE 'lok';

Assessment: The returned record explicitly marks Lok as Type = Village, directly supporting the claim.

Assumptions: Interpreted the claim as referring to the settlement named “Lok” located in Vojvodina, Serbia. If a different “Lok” (in another country/region) was intended, this verification specifically covers the Vojvodina locality present in the available data source.
