Summary conclusion: The claim is not correct for 1975. In the 1975 Cleveland International Piano Competition, second place was Julian Martin (USA) and fourth place was Roe Van Boskirk (USA). The pairing “Anders Martinson (USA) second” and “Jean‑François Bouvery (France) fourth” occurs in 1991, not 1975.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: cleveland_international_piano_competition (year, first, second, third, fourth)

Schema details:
- cleveland_international_piano_competition
  - year: bigint
  - first: text
  - second: text
  - third: text
  - fourth: text

Evidence 1 — 1975 results (contradicts the claim):
- Result row for 1975:
  - First: John Owings (USA)
  - Second: Julian Martin (USA)
  - Third: John‑Patrick Millow (France)
  - Fourth: Roe Van Boskirk (USA)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 1975;

Evidence 2 — 1991 results (shows where the claimed pairing actually appears):
- Result row for 1991:
  - First: Ilya Itin (Russia)
  - Second: Anders Martinson (USA)
  - Third: Markus Pawlik (Germany)
  - Fourth: Jean‑François Bouvery (France)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE year = 1991;

Supplementary search for names (corroboration):
- This search shows entries where the strings ‘Jean’, ‘François’, or ‘Bouvery’ appear, including the 1991 row with Jean‑François Bouvery (France) in fourth and Anders Martinson (USA) in second:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM cleveland_international_piano_competition WHERE first ILIKE '%Jean%' OR first ILIKE '%François%' OR first ILIKE '%Bouvery%' OR second ILIKE '%Jean%' OR second ILIKE '%François%' OR second ILIKE '%Bouvery%' OR third ILIKE '%Jean%' OR third ILIKE '%François%' OR third ILIKE '%Bouvery%' OR fourth ILIKE '%Jean%' OR fourth ILIKE '%François%' OR fourth ILIKE '%Bouvery%';

Assessment:
- The specific assertion “in 1975 … Jean‑François Bouvery (France) came fourth when Anders Martinson (USA) came second” is false for 1975. Those exact placements and nationalities occur in 1991.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to placements in the Cleveland International Piano Competition, which is the authoritative dataset available in the current data environment.
- “Come in second/fourth” is interpreted as final placement positions in that year’s competition.
