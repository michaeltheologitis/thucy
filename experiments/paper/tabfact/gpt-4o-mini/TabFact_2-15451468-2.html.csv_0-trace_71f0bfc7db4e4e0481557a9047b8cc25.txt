Data sources explored
- Connected PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, game site, attendance).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Saints opponent before Week 7
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance 
FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season 
WHERE week < 7 AND opponent ILIKE '%Saints%';
- Result:
  • Week: 3
  • Date: 1970 - 10 - 04
  • Opponent: New Orleans Saints
  • Result: L 14 - 10
  • Game Site: Tulane Stadium
  • Attendance: 69126

2) Games before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, "game site", attendance 
FROM public.t_1970_new_york_giants_season 
WHERE week < 7 AND date IS NOT NULL AND "game site" ILIKE '%Tulane%';
- Result (one match):
  • Week: 3
  • Date: October 4, 1970
  • Opponent: New Orleans Saints
  • Result: Lost (14 - 10)
  • Game Site: Tulane Stadium
  • Attendance: 69,126

Findings
- The available dataset (1970 New York Giants season) shows that before Week 7 (specifically Week 3), the Giants played the New Orleans Saints at Tulane Stadium. This substantiates the claim—within the scope of the available data—that the New Orleans Saints played before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as asking whether, in the available 1970 NFL game data, the New Orleans Saints had a game before Week 7 at Tulane Stadium. The verification is limited to this dataset (1970 New York Giants season) and does not generalize to other seasons.
