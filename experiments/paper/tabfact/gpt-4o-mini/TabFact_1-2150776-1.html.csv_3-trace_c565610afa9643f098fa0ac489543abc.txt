Claim evaluated: “In 1997, Jeff Gordon finished with a time of 3:34:33.”

Data source discovery
- Connected database: TabFact
- Available table: public.pocono_400
- Relevant columns: year, date, driver, team, manufacturer, laps, "-", "race time", "average speed (mph)", report

Schema verification
- Table: public.pocono_400 (authoritative dataset for this verification task)

Evidence collection
1) Full listing to locate the 1997 entry
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, date, driver, "race time" FROM public.pocono_400 ORDER BY year ASC;
Key portion of returned results includes:
- 1997 | June 8 | Jeff Gordon | 3:34:33

2) Targeted lookup for year 1997
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, date, driver, "race time" FROM public.pocono_400 WHERE year = 1997;
Result:
- year: 1997
- date: june 8

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly shows that for the year 1997, the driver listed is Jeff Gordon and the recorded race time is 3:34:33. This directly supports the claim.
