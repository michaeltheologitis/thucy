Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships (1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships).
- Relevant columns include: name (text) and points (double precision).

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve the points for any participants whose names contain 'Pierre' or 'Shinji' (case-insensitive):
SQL executed:
SELECT name, points FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%pierre%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%shinji%';

Result rows:
- Name: Pierre Lamine, Points: 150.5
- Name: Shinji Someya, Points: 150.34

Computation:
- Difference (Pierre Lamine minus Shinji Someya) = 150.50 − 150.34 = 0.16 points

Conclusion:
- Pierre Lamine has 0.16 more points than Shinji Someya, as supported by the table data.

Assumptions:
- "point" refers to the "points" column in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships table.
- The names in the claim correspond to the participants listed in this dataset.
