Claim to verify: "the dundee hurricane have 2 losing season, in 2006 and 2009"

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table public.dundee_hurricanes containing season-by-season records (season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes).

Evidence gathered via SQL:
1) Query: List all seasons with a losing record (wins < losses)
SQL executed:
SELECT season, division, wins, losses, ties, notes 
FROM dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE wins < losses;
Result:
- Season: 2006 | Division: bafl division 2 scottish | Wins: 3 | Losses: 4 | Ties: 0 | Notes: -
- Season: 2009 | Division: bafl division 1 north    | Wins: 2 | Losses: 6 | Ties: 1 | Notes: -

2) Query: Count losing seasons and list the seasons
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losing_record_count 
FROM dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE wins < losses;
Result:
- losing_record_count: 2

SQL executed:
SELECT season 
FROM dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE wins < losses;
Result:
- 2006
- 2009

Conclusion:
- The data shows exactly two seasons with more losses than wins: 2006 and 2009. This matches the claim.

Assumptions:
- "Losing season" is defined as wins < losses (ties do not negate a losing record if losses still exceed wins).
