Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the team name is “Golden State Warriors” when the location attendance is “HemisFair Arena 16057”. I verify this against the available season game log data for the Seattle Supersonics (1991–92).

Data source exploration
- Available database: public schema with a table t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season (Seattle Supersonics 1991–92 season logs). The “team” column represents the opponent team. The “location attendance” column stores arena and attendance together (e.g., “Hemisfair Arena 16057”).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify the game(s) with location attendance = “HemisFair Arena 16057”
SQL:
SELECT date, team, score, record 
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season 
WHERE LOWER("location attendance") = LOWER('hemisfair arena 16057');
Result: Date: March 21; Team: San Antonio Spurs; Score: L 96 - 101; Record: 37 - 31.

2) Check all rows where the opponent is Golden State Warriors to see the associated location/attendance
SQL:
SELECT date, "location attendance", score FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE team = 'golden state warriors'
Result: Date: March 17; Location Attendance: Seattle Center Coliseum 13163; Score: L 107 - 119.

3) List all games at HemisFair Arena (any attendance) for completeness
SQL:
SELECT date, team, score, "location attendance" 
FROM public.t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season 
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%HemisFair Arena%';
Result: Date: March 21; Team: San Antonio Spurs; Score: L 96 - 101; Location Attendance: Hemisfair Arena 16057.

Assessment
- The only game with “HemisFair Arena 16057” in this dataset lists the opponent as the San Antonio Spurs, not the Golden State Warriors.
- The Golden State Warriors game in this dataset has “Seattle Center Coliseum 13163” as the location/attendance, not HemisFair Arena 16057.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “team name” as the opponent team listed in the “team” column (as this table catalogs the Seattle Supersonics’ season, with opponents in the “team” field).
- Interpreted “location attendance” as a combined field of arena name and attendance (e.g., “Hemisfair Arena 16057”).
