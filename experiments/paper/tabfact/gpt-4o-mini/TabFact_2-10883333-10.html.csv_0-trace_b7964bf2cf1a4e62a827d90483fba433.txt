Claim interpreted: “Princes Park venue has more crowd than the Junction Oval [venue].” We verify this using the available 1975 VFL season match-attendance data.

Data environment explored
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with a single table t_1975_vfl_season.
- Table schema (key fields): home team (text), away team (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text). This table records match attendances (“crowd”) and venues for the 1975 VFL season.

Evidence 1: Identify relevant matches at Princes Park and Junction Oval
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd 
FROM t_1975_vfl_season 
WHERE venue ILIKE '%Princes Park%' OR venue ILIKE '%Junction Oval%' 
ORDER BY venue, date;

Result:
1) Date: 7 June 1975 | Home Team: Fitzroy | Away Team: Carlton | Venue: Junction Oval | Crowd: 16,249
2) Date: 7 June 1975 | Home Team: Hawthorn | Away Team: Collingwood | Venue: Princes Park | Crowd: 23,830

Evidence 2: Compare attendance totals and averages by venue
Executed SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS matches, SUM(crowd) AS total_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS average_crowd, MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd 
FROM t_1975_vfl_season 
WHERE LOWER(venue) LIKE '%princes park%' OR LOWER(venue) LIKE '%junction oval%' 
GROUP BY venue;

Result:
- Junction Oval: matches=1, total_crowd=16,249, average_crowd=16,249, min=16,249, max=16,249
- Princes Park: matches=1, total_crowd=23,830, average_crowd=23,830, min=23,830, max=23,830

Conclusion
Within the 1975 VFL season dataset, Princes Park drew a higher crowd (23,830) than Junction Oval (16,249). This holds for both total and average attendance at these venues in the dataset.

Assumptions and interpretation notes
- “prince park” is interpreted as the venue “Princes Park,” the standard name in this dataset.
- “menu” is interpreted as a typographical error for “venue.”
- “more crowd” is interpreted as higher match attendance. We compared both total and average attendance for matches recorded at each venue within the 1975 VFL season data. The dataset shows one recorded match at each venue for that season, and the comparison is based on those records.
