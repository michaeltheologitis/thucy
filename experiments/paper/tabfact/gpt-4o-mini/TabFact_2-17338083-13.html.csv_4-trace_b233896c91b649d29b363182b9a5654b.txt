Claim to verify: “yi be the name when the royal house be ji and the state be cai and the year be 826.”

Data source explored
- Database contains table: public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc with columns: state, type, name, title, royal house, from.

Context sample (to understand structure)
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc LIMIT 20;
- Result excerpt shows an entry for the State of Cai:
  - from: 837 bc | name: yi | royal house: ji | state: cai | title: marquis | type: sovereign

Direct evidence for State = Cai and Royal House = Ji
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'cai' AND "royal house" = 'ji';
- Result:
  - from: 837 bc | name: yi | royal house: ji | state: cai | title: marquis | type: sovereign

Check for an exact record “from = 826 bc” for Cai (to clarify date field)
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state='cai' AND "royal house"='ji' AND "from"='826 bc';
- Result: no rows.

Interpretation
- The table explicitly catalogs leaders “in the 820s BC.” For the State of Cai (royal house: Ji), the listed leader during that decade is “yi,” with a start year recorded as 837 bc. Although there is no row whose “from” value equals 826 bc for Cai, the table’s scope indicates that “yi” was the incumbent for the 820s BC, which includes the year 826 bc.

Conclusion
- For the State of Cai with royal house Ji in the year 826 bc (within the 820s BC), the name is “yi,” as supported by the table entry.

Assumptions made
- “Year be 826” is interpreted as asking who held the position in 826 bc and leveraging the dataset’s scope (leaders in the 820s BC) to identify the incumbent. The “from” column is treated as the start of reign, not necessarily the specific year queried, and inclusion in this table implies incumbency during the 820s decade, covering 826 bc.
