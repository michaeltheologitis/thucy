Summary of what was checked
- Interpreted the claim as: “The score was 1–0 and the home team was Bolton Wanderers.”
- Explored the only available dataset (FA Cup 1990–1991) and searched for any matches involving Bolton Wanderers, especially with them as the home team and a 1–0 score.

Data source discovery
- Available schemas: information_schema, pg_catalog, pg_toast, public
- Relevant table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup

Executed SQL (evidence)
1) List schemas
SELECT schemata.schema_name
FROM information_schema.schemata;

2) List tables in public schema with comments
SELECT table_schema, table_name, obj_description( (table_schema || '.' || table_name)::regclass ) AS table_comment
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

3) Describe columns for public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1990_91_fa_cup';

4) Attempt to find Bolton Wanderers as home team (no rows returned)
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE LOWER("home team") = LOWER('Bolton Wanderers');

5) Find any rows where home or away contains 'Bolton'
SELECT "tie no", "date", "home team", "score", "away team" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%bolton%' OR LOWER("away team") LIKE '%bolton%' ;

Result from (5)
- Tie No: 11 | Date: 26 / 01 / 1991 | Home Team: Manchester United | Score: 1 - 0 | Away Team: Bolton Wanderers

Findings
- The dataset contains one match involving Bolton Wanderers in the 1990–91 FA Cup: Manchester United 1–0 Bolton Wanderers, with Bolton Wanderers as the away team.
- No evidence in this dataset shows a 1–0 match with Bolton Wanderers as the home team.

Conclusion
- The “1–0” score aligns with a match involving Bolton Wanderers, but the home team was Manchester United, not Bolton Wanderers. Therefore, the claim is partly incorrect within the scope of the available data.

Assumptions
- “Bolton wanderer” was interpreted as “Bolton Wanderers.”
- Verification was constrained to the FA Cup 1990–1991 dataset, which is the only accessible data source. No claims are made about other seasons or competitions.
