Claim interpreted: The final scoreline was 4 - 6, 3 - 6 at the Stuttgart Open (Stuttgart, Germany) on a clay surface.

Findings from the data:
- The database contains a record for the Stuttgart Open held in Stuttgart, Germany on clay, involving Fabio Fognini in the final. The recorded final score for that event is 5 - 7, 6 - 4, 6 - 4 (opponent: Philipp Kohlschreiber), not 4 - 6, 3 - 6.
- A final score of 4 - 6, 3 - 6 is present in the data, but it corresponds to a different tournament: the BRD Năstase Ţiriac Trophy (Bucharest, Romania) on clay, vs Gilles Simon, dated 29 April 2012.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) To see tournaments and surfaces (confirms Stuttgart Open is on clay)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT tournament, surface FROM fabio_fognini;
Result excerpt includes:
- Tournament: Stuttgart Open; Surface: Clay

2) To retrieve the Stuttgart Open entry and its final score
SQL:
SELECT tournament, date, surface, "opponent in the final", "score in the final"
FROM fabio_fognini
WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Stuttgart%';
Result:
- Tournament: Stuttgart Open, Stuttgart, Germany
- Date: 14 July 2013
- Surface: Clay
- Opponent in the Final: Philipp Kohlschreiber
- Score in the Final: 5 - 7, 6 - 4, 6 - 4

3) To check for any final with score 4 - 6, 3 - 6
SQL:
SELECT tournament, date, surface, "opponent in the final", "score in the final"
FROM fabio_fognini
WHERE "score in the final" = '4 - 6 , 3 - 6';
Result:
- Tournament: BRD Năstase Ţiriac Trophy
- Date: 29 April 2012
- Surface: Clay
- Opponent in the Final: Gilles Simon
- Score in the Final: 4 - 6 , 3 - 6

Conclusion:
- Surface and tournament/location context (Stuttgart Open, Stuttgart, Germany, clay) are correct in the data.
- The final score claimed (4 - 6, 3 - 6) does not match the Stuttgart Open record; the actual recorded score is 5 - 7, 6 - 4, 6 - 4.

Assumptions:
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available database, which documents Fabio Fognini’s finals.
- The phrase refers to Fognini’s Stuttgart Open final appearance (2013), given the table contents.
