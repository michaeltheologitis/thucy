Claim: “the specie that test positive for indol also test positive on the methyl red reading.”

Summary of approach
- Explored the available data sources and identified a table (imvic) containing IMViC biochemical test results by species.
- Queried the table to check whether any species with indole = 'positive' had methyl red ≠ 'positive'.
- Counted relevant categories and listed the species involved to provide concrete evidence.

Key findings
1) No exceptions found: all indole-positive species are also methyl-red-positive in this dataset.
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT species, indole, "methyl red" 
   FROM imvic 
   WHERE indole = 'positive' AND "methyl red" <> 'positive';
   Result: 0 rows.

2) Data normalization check: values are standardized as 'positive'/'negative' for both tests.
   Executed SQL:
   - For indole distinct values:
     SELECT DISTINCT indole FROM imvic;
   - For methyl red distinct values:
     SELECT DISTINCT "methyl red" FROM imvic;
   Results:
   - indole: {negative, positive}
   - methyl red: {negative, positive}

3) Counts confirm the relationship in-scope:
   Executed SQL:
   - Total species count:
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species) AS total_species FROM public.imvic;
     Result: 7
   - Indole-positive species count:
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species) AS positive_indole FROM public.imvic WHERE indole = 'positive';
     Result: 2
   - Indole-positive and methyl-red-positive species count:
     SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT species) AS positive_indole_methyl_red FROM public.imvic WHERE indole = 'positive' AND "methyl red" = 'positive';
     Result: 2

4) Which species are indole-positive (and their MR results):
   Executed SQL:
   SELECT species, "methyl red" FROM imvic WHERE indole = 'positive';
   Results:
   - Escherichia coli — methyl red: positive
   - Proteus vulgaris — methyl red: positive

Conclusion
- Within the available data (imvic table), every species that tests positive for indole also tests positive for methyl red. No counterexamples are present in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The verification is based solely on the species represented in the imvic table of the available database. The claim is evaluated within this data scope, which contains 7 species entries.
