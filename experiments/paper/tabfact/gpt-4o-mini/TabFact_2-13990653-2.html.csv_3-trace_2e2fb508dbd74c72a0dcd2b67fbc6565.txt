Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season covering the 2007 Uni-President Lions season.
- Table schema (from schema introspection):
  - date TEXT
  - opponent TEXT
  - score TEXT
  - loss TEXT
  - save TEXT

Evidence collected
1) Distinct opponents in the season data
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season;
Result excerpt: LA New Bears; Brother Elephants; Macoto Cobras; Chinatrust Whales

2) All games vs Chinatrust Whales
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE opponent = 'chinatrust whales'
Results:
- 3 / 22 | chinatrust whales | 7 - 9 | kao lung - wei | ni fu - deh
- 3 / 23 | chinatrust whales | 4 - 5 | pan wei - lun | miguel saladin
Observation: The only game where Pan Wei-Lun took the loss vs Chinatrust Whales (3/23) had the save credited to Miguel Saladin, not Huang Chun-Chung.

3) All games where save = 'huang chun - chung'
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save 
FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season 
WHERE save = 'huang chun - chung';
Results:
- 3 / 17 | la new bears | 4 - 5 | pan wei - lun | huang chun - chung
- 3 / 25 | la new bears | 1 - 6 | rob cordemans | huang chun - chung
Observation: Huang Chun-Chung recorded saves vs LA New Bears, not vs Chinatrust Whales in the retrieved records.

4) All games where loss = 'pan wei - lun'
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, save FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season WHERE loss = 'pan wei - lun';
Results:
- 3 / 17 | la new bears | 4 - 5 | pan wei - lun | huang chun - chung
- 3 / 23 | chinatrust whales | 4 - 5 | pan wei - lun | miguel saladin
Observation: The combination “Pan Wei-Lun loss and Huang Chun-Chung save” occurred on 3/17 vs LA New Bears, not against Chinatrust Whales.

Assessment
- True elements:
  - Pan Wei-Lun did take a loss in a game against the Chinatrust Whales (3/23).
  - Huang Chun-Chung did record saves during the season (e.g., 3/17 and 3/25), but these were in games vs LA New Bears.
- False element:
  - There is no game in this dataset against the Chinatrust Whales where the save was credited to Huang Chun-Chung when Pan Wei-Lun took the loss.

Conclusion: The specific combined claim (Pan Wei-Lun loss + Huang Chun-Chung save vs Chinatrust Whales) is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguous phrasing
- “Chinatrust whale” interpreted as the CPBL team “Chinatrust Whales”.
- Names matched exactly as stored in the dataset (lowercase with spaces/hyphens), e.g., “pan wei - lun”, “huang chun - chung”.
