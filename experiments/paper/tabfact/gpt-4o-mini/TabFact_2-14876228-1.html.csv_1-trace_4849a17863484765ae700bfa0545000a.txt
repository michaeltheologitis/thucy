Claim interpreted: “the total number score of the team position higher than 10 be zero.” I interpret “score” as the goals scored (column `scored`) and “position higher than 10” as `position > 10` in the table t_2005_in_paraguayan_football.

Data source overview
- Table: public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football
- Columns: position, team, played, wins, draws, losses, scored, conceded, points

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Are there any teams with position > 10?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_count, SUM(scored) AS total_scored, SUM(points) AS total_points FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football WHERE position > 10;
Result: team_count = 0, total_scored = null, total_points = null (no teams beyond position 10)

2) Express the totals with zero for empty sums (for practical interpretation):
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS team_count, 
       COALESCE(SUM(scored), 0) AS total_scored_zero, 
       COALESCE(SUM(points), 0) AS total_points_zero 
FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football 
WHERE position > 10;
Result: team_count = 0, total_scored_zero = 0, total_points_zero = 0

3) Context check: range of positions in the table
SQL:
SELECT MIN(position) AS min_position FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football;
Result: 1
SQL:
SELECT MAX(position) AS max_position FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football;
Result: 10
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM public.t_2005_in_paraguayan_football;
Result: 10

Findings
- There are 10 teams total, with positions ranging from 1 to 10. No teams exist with position > 10.
- Consequently, the sum of goals scored (scored) for teams with position > 10 is 0 when treating empty sums as zero (COALESCE), and null in a raw SUM over an empty set. Practically, the total is zero because there are no such teams.

Conclusion
- The claim that the total score (interpreted as goals scored) for teams with position higher than 10 is zero is supported by the data, given there are no teams beyond position 10.

Assumptions
- “score” refers to the `scored` (goals scored) column rather than `points`.
- “position higher than 10” means position > 10.
- The relevant dataset is the 2005 Paraguayan football table described above.
