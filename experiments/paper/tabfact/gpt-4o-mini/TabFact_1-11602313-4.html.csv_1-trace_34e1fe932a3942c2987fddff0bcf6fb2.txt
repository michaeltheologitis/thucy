Claim to verify: "part number lf80537 gf0411 m have a frequency of 2 ghz"

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
- Relevant columns: model number, sspec number, frequency, l2 cache, fsb, mult, voltage, tdp, socket, release date, part number (s), release price ( usd )

Evidence collected (with executed SQL)
1) Locate entries with part number containing 'lf80537'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE "part number (s)" LIKE '%lf80537%';
Result (excerpt showing the most relevant match):
- Model Number: Pentium Dual-Core T3200
- Part Number (s): LF80537 GF0411 M
- Frequency: 2 GHz

2) Locate entries with part number containing 'gf0411'
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE "part number (s)" LIKE '%gf0411%';
Result:
- Model Number: Pentium Dual-Core T3200
- SSpec Number: SLAVG (M0)
- Frequency: 2 GHz
- L2 Cache: 1 MB
- FSB: 667 MT/s
- Mult: 12
- Voltage: 1.075 - 1.175V
- TDP: 35 W
- Socket: Socket P
- Release Date: Q4 2008
- Part Number (s): LF80537 GF0411 M
- Release Price (USD): OEM

3) Confirm a single row contains both substrings (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", frequency, "part number (s)" 
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
WHERE LOWER("part number (s)") LIKE '%lf80537%' 
AND LOWER("part number (s)") LIKE '%gf0411%';
Result:
- Model Number: pentium dual - core t3200
- Frequency: 2 ghz
- Part Number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m

4) Robust match ignoring spaces (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT "model number", frequency, "part number (s)"
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors
WHERE LOWER(REPLACE("part number (s)", ' ', '')) LIKE '%lf80537gf0411m%';
Result:
- Model Number: Pentium Dual - Core T3200
- Frequency: 2 GHz
- Part Number: lf80537 gf0411 m

Conclusion
- The table contains a processor entry with Part Number (s) = "LF80537 GF0411 M" and its frequency is explicitly listed as "2 GHz". This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Matching for the part number was done case-insensitively and tolerant of spacing variations to accommodate formatting differences in the source data.
