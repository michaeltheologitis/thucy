What I checked:
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: list_of_all_that_episodes.
- Table schema (key columns): season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text, NOT NULL), "original air date" (text), "nick prod" (bigint).

Evidence and results:
1) Count of titles starting with letter T (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS title_count 
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes 
WHERE LOWER("episode title") LIKE 't%';
Result: 3

2) List the titles starting with letter T (case-insensitive)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "episode title" 
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes 
WHERE LOWER("episode title") LIKE 't%';
Result titles:
- tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j
- tyra banks / blackstreet
- tony! toni! tone!

3) Robust check with TRIM and case-insensitive matching
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count, ARRAY_AGG(TRIM("episode title")) AS episode_titles 
FROM list_of_all_that_episodes 
WHERE TRIM("episode title") ILIKE 't%';
Result: episode_count = 3; episode_titles = {"tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j","tyra banks / blackstreet","tony! toni! tone!"}

Conclusion:
- The data shows 3 episode titles starting with the letter T, not 1.

Assumptions made:
- "start with the letter t" is interpreted case-insensitively and after trimming leading whitespace.
- The claim pertains to the table list_of_all_that_episodes in the connected database.
