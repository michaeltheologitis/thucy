Claim to verify: The episode that aired on March 31, 2008 is titled “New York: Secret Societies.”

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database with a public.cities_of_the_underworld table containing: production no (bigint), episode no (bigint), original airdate (text), episode title (text), host (text).

Evidence from executed SQL queries:
1) Query to list 2008 episodes (shows the March 31, 2008 row and its title)
SQL:
SELECT "episode no", "original airdate", "episode title"
FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld
WHERE "original airdate" LIKE '%2008'
ORDER BY "episode no";
Result excerpt (relevant row):
- Episode No: 209 | Original Airdate: March 31 , 2008 | Episode Title: New York : Secret Societies

2) Direct lookup by episode number 209 (confirms the airdate and title)
SQL:
SELECT "episode no", "original airdate", "episode title" FROM public.cities_of_the_underworld WHERE "episode no" = 209;
Result:
- Episode No: 209 | Original Airdate: March 31, 2008 | Episode Title: New York: Secret Societies

Assessment:
- Both queries indicate that the episode airing on March 31, 2008 has the title “New York: Secret Societies.” Minor spacing differences around punctuation in one listing are formatting artifacts and do not change the title.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The question refers to the History Channel series represented by the available dataset (Cities of the Underworld).
