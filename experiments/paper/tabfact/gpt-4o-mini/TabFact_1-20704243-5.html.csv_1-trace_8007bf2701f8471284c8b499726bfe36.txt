Claim assessed: "series number 50 have have 3.38 million viewer"

Data source explored:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_leverage_episodes (columns: series, season, title, directed by, written by, original air date, us viewers (in millions))

Step 1: Inspect table contents to understand columns and numbering
- Observation: The table lists episodes of the TV show Leverage with an overall episode number (series), an in-season episode number (season), and US viewership in millions.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes LIMIT 10;
- Key excerpt from results (relevant rows):
  - Series 50 | Season 6 | Title: The Carnival Job | US Viewers (in millions): 3.38

Step 2: Verify the specific claim about series number 50
- Executed SQL:
SELECT series, season, title, "us viewers (in millions)"
FROM public.list_of_leverage_episodes
WHERE series = 50;
- Result:
  - Series: 50
  - Season: 6
  - Title: The Carnival Job
  - US Viewers (in millions): 3.38

Conclusion:
- The data shows that the episode with overall series number 50 (“The Carnival Job”) had 3.38 million US viewers. This supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- "series number 50" refers to the overall episode number captured in the column named series (not the in-season episode number captured in season).
- "viewer" refers to the US viewers (in millions) column in the dataset, i.e., US live/same-day viewership as recorded in this table.
