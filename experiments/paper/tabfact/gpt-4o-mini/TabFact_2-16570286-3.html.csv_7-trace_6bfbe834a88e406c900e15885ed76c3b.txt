Summary
- Claim: "all of the england player take as many wicket as bill johnston"
- Interpreted within the available data (1948 Ashes series): This asserts that every England player listed for the 1948 Ashes took as many wickets as Bill Johnston.
- Finding: False. Bill Johnston took 27 wickets; no England player in the dataset reached 27 wickets, and their wicket tallies are all lower.

Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema with table public.t_1948_ashes_series (players and bowling stats for the 1948 Ashes series).
  - Columns: player (text), team (text), matches (bigint), wickets (bigint), average (double precision), best bowling (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify players and wickets (full list to see England vs. Australia wicket counts)
SQL:
SELECT player, team, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series;
Result excerpt:
- ray lindwall | australia | 27
- bill johnston | australia | 27
- alec bedser | england | 18
- keith miller | australia | 13
- ernie toshack | australia | 11
- norman yardley | england | 9
- jim laker | england | 9

2) Players with exactly 27 wickets (to test equality with Bill Johnston)
SQL:
SELECT player, team, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE wickets = 27;
Result:
- ray lindwall | australia | 27
- bill johnston | australia | 27
Interpretation: No England player appears with 27 wickets.

3) Bill Johnston’s wickets (to confirm his tally explicitly)
SQL:
SELECT player, wickets FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player ILIKE 'Bill Johnston';
Result:
- bill johnston | 27

Conclusion
- No England player in the dataset has as many wickets as Bill Johnston (27). England players listed have 18, 9, and 9 wickets, all less than 27.
- Therefore, the claim that “all of the England player(s) take as many wicket(s) as Bill Johnston” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “as many wickets as” is interpreted as an equality comparison of wicket counts.
- “England player” refers to players recorded under team = 'england' in this 1948 Ashes series table (not career totals or other series).
