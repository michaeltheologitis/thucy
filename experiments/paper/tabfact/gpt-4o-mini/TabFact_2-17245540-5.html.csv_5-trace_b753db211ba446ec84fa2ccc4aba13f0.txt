Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that Gene Borek, who finished T6 (tied for 6th) in the 1973 U.S. Open golf results, is from New Zealand.

Evidence from the data:
1) Full view of relevant fields
- SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place, player;
- Result excerpt (relevant rows):
  - t6 | gene borek | united states
  - t6 | arnold palmer | united states
  - t6 | julius boros | united states
  - t6 | lee trevino | united states
  - t6 | tom weiskopf | united states
  - t3 | bob charles | new zealand
  (This shows Gene Borek finished t6 and his country is listed as united states, not New Zealand.)

2) Direct lookup of Gene Borek
- SQL:
  SELECT place, player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(player) = 'gene borek';
- Result:
  - place: t6 | player: gene borek | country: united states

3) All T6 finishers and their countries
- SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place ILIKE 't6';
- Result:
  - gene borek | united states
  - julius boros | united states
  - tom weiskopf | united states
  - arnold palmer | united states
  - lee trevino | united states

4) Who is from New Zealand?
- SQL:
  SELECT player, place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(country) = 'new zealand';
- Result:
  - bob charles | t3

Conclusion:
- The table shows Gene Borek finished t6 and his listed country is united states. The only player from New Zealand in this table is Bob Charles (t3). Therefore, the claim that the player Gene Borek (t6) is from New Zealand is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- “t6” is interpreted as the tied-for-6th finishing position in the 1973 U.S. Open golf results contained in the table public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf.
- The field “country” indicates player nationality for this event.
