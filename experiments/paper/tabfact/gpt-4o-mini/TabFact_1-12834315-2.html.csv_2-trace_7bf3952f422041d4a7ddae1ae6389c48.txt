Claim to verify: "the fire control for the sporter target be a1"

Interpretation: The claim asserts that the Colt Sporter Target model’s fire control is “A1.” I interpret “Sporter Target” as the Colt model commonly known as the Sporter Target (model R6551), and “fire control” as the configuration recorded in the database’s "fire control" field.

Evidence from data
1) Direct lookup of the Sporter Target row
- Result: The entry for “sporter target” shows fire control = “s - 1,” not “A1.”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "colt model no", name, "fire control" FROM my_info_table WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('sporter target')

- Returned row:
  - colt model no: r6551
  - name: sporter target
  - fire control: s - 1

2) Cross-check by listing all models (to confirm presence and value)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "colt model no", name, "fire control" FROM my_info_table;

- Relevant returned row excerpt:
| colt model no | name            | fire control |
| r6551         | sporter target  | s - 1        |

Conclusion
The data shows the Colt Sporter Target (R6551) has fire control recorded as “s - 1,” not “A1.” Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Sporter target” refers to the Colt Sporter Target model (R6551) present in the dataset.
- “A1” is being asserted as the fire control marking/type, comparable to what the database records in the "fire control" field.
