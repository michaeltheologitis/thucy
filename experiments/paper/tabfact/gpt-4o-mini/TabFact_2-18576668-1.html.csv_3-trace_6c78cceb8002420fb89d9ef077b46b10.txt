Claim interpreted: “the last 2 game in season 5 be hold in los angeles and london.” Interpreting “season 5” as the 2005 season (the only season in the dataset that could plausibly align with a “5”) and “game” as “event,” we verify whether the final two events (by end date) in the 2005 season occurred in Los Angeles and London.

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: tsuyoshi_fujita(season text, "event type" text, location text, format text, date text, rank bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct seasons available (to see how seasons are labeled)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita;
Result (abridged): 1997 - 98, 1998 - 99, 1999 - 00, 2000 - 01, 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, 2003 - 04, 2005, 2011.

2) Check for a literal “Season 5” entry (none found)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = 'Season 5' OR season = '5';
Result: No rows.

3) List all events in the 2005 season (locations and dates)
SQL:
SELECT "event type", location, date, rank FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2005';
Result:
- Grand Prix | Seattle | 5 - 6 March 2005 | 7
- Invitational | Los Angeles | 17 - 20 May 2005 | 2
- Pro Tour | London | 8 - 10 July 2005 | 2
- Pro Tour | Los Angeles | 28 - 30 October 2005 | 5

4) Determine the last two events in 2005 by parsing the end date and ordering descending
SQL:
SELECT "event type", location, date, to_date(trim(split_part(date, '-', 2)), 'DD Month YYYY') AS end_date
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE season = '2005'
ORDER BY end_date DESC
LIMIT 2;
Result (ordered by parsed end_date desc):
- Pro Tour | Los Angeles | 28 - 30 October 2005 | end_date = 2005-10-30
- Pro Tour | London | 8 - 10 July 2005 | end_date = 2005-07-10

Analysis
- The final two events in the 2005 season were indeed held in Los Angeles (Oct 30, 2005) and London (Jul 10, 2005). This matches the claim’s locations, though the dataset labels the season as “2005” rather than “Season 5,” and the term “game” corresponds to “event.”

Conclusion
- Under the reasonable interpretation that “season 5” refers to the 2005 season and “game” refers to event, the claim is supported: the last two events in 2005 were in London and Los Angeles.

Assumptions made
- “Season 5” maps to the 2005 season label in the dataset (since no literal “Season 5” exists).
- “Game” is interpreted as “event.”
- “Last two” are determined by the parsed event end date within the season.
