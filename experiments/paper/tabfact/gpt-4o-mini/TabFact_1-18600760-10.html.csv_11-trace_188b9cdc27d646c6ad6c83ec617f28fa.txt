Claim being checked: “the latitude for the township janke be -97.945530”.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public.
- Relevant table: list_of_townships_in_north_dakota (includes columns: township, county, latitude, longitude, etc.).

Schema details (relevant columns):
- township (text)
- county (text)
- latitude (double precision)
- longitude (text)

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT township, county, latitude, longitude 
  FROM list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
  WHERE township ILIKE '%Janke%';

- Result:
  township: Janke
  county: Logan
  latitude: 46.415512
  longitude: -99.131701

Assessment:
- The dataset lists Janke Township (Logan County, North Dakota) with latitude 46.415512.
- The claimed value “-97.945530” cannot be a latitude (valid latitude range is -90 to 90). It also does not match the recorded latitude for Janke Township.
- Note: -97.945530 numerically resembles a longitude value typical for the region, but the recorded longitude for Janke Township is -99.131701, not -97.945530. Regardless, the claim is specifically about latitude and is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the latitude for Janke Township is -97.945530 is not supported by the data. The correct latitude in the available dataset is 46.415512.

Assumptions:
- “township janke” refers to Janke Township in North Dakota (as listed in the table list_of_townships_in_north_dakota). If a different jurisdiction was intended, it is outside the scope of the available data.
