Summary conclusion
- NGC 1705 has a recorded redshift (radial velocity) of 633 ± 6 km/s in the available dataset, and it is the smallest value among all entries in that dataset.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all objects and their redshift entries
- Result (excerpt): includes an entry for ngc 1705 with “633 ± 6”.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" FROM public.dorado_group;

2) Extract numeric speed and uncertainty, sort ascending, show top values
- Result (top 5 by speed_value):
  - ngc 1705 | 633 ± 6 | speed_value=633 | uncertainty_value=6
  - ngc 1533 | 790 ± 5 | speed_value=790 | uncertainty_value=5
  - ngc 1796 | 1014 ± 9 | speed_value=1014 | uncertainty_value=9
  - ngc 1574 | 1050 ± 25 | speed_value=1050 | uncertainty_value=25
  - ngc 1617 | 1063 ± 21 | speed_value=1063 | uncertainty_value=21
- SQL executed:
  SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" AS original_field,
         CAST(SPLIT_PART("redshift (km / s )", '±', 1) AS INTEGER) AS speed_value,
         CAST(SPLIT_PART("redshift (km / s )", '±', 2) AS INTEGER) AS uncertainty_value
  FROM dorado_group
  ORDER BY speed_value ASC
  LIMIT 5;

3) Confirm the minimum speed value and which object(s) have it
- Result: Minimum speed_value = 633, corresponding to ngc 1705 only.
- SQL executed (min value):
  SELECT name,
         CAST(SPLIT_PART("redshift (km / s )", '±', 1) AS INTEGER) AS speed_value
  FROM dorado_group
  ORDER BY speed_value ASC
  LIMIT 1;
- SQL executed (object(s) with the minimum):
  SELECT name
  FROM dorado_group
  WHERE CAST(SPLIT_PART("redshift (km / s )", '±', 1) AS INTEGER) =
        (SELECT MIN(CAST(SPLIT_PART("redshift (km / s )", '±', 1) AS INTEGER))
         FROM dorado_group);

4) Full row for NGC 1705 (to verify the exact value and uncertainty)
- Result: name=ngc 1705; redshift (km/s)=633 ± 6; other metadata present.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 1705';

Assessment of the claim
- “ngc 1705 have the smallest redshift … 633 km/s ± 6 km/s”: Supported by the dataset. NGC 1705 is the minimum in this table, and its recorded value is 633 ± 6 km/s.

Assumptions
- The phrase “smallest redshift” is interpreted as the smallest redshift value within the available dorado_group dataset accessed here.
- The “redshift (km/s)” column represents radial velocity values (cz) reported with uncertainties, stored as text and parsed as shown above.
