Assessment of the claim
- “lose to Penn State … on September 27th” – Inaccurate. The Sept 27 opponent was Villanova, not Penn State. The Penn State loss occurred on Oct 25.
- “whose record be 2 - 1” – The Army record became 2–1 after the Sept 27 game (vs Villanova), which is accurate for that date but not connected to a Penn State game.

Conclusion: The claim mixes a correct record and date with the wrong opponent; the Penn State loss occurred nearly a month later. Therefore, the statement is not accurate overall.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the 1975 Army football season (team historically known as Cadets/Black Knights), as this is the authoritative data available in the connected database.
- “record be 2 - 1” is interpreted as Army’s record after the Sept 27 game, consistent with the table’s “record” field.
