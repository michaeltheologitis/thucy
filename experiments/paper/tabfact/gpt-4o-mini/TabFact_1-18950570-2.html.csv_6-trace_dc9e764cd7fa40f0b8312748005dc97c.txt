Claim to verify: “the total life expectancy in 1950 - 1955 be greater than 70.1 and the cdr be less than 32.5”.

Data source discovery and schema check:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table my_info_table.
- Relevant columns (types): period (text), cdr (double precision), life expectancy total (double precision), plus other demographic fields.

Evidence queries and results:
1) Retrieve the period row and relevant metrics
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, "life expectancy total", cdr FROM my_info_table WHERE period = '1950 - 1955';
- Result:
  period: 1950 - 1955
  life expectancy total: 50.9
  cdr: 15.5

2) Directly evaluate both conditions in SQL
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period, "life expectancy total", cdr,
         ("life expectancy total" > 70.1 AND cdr < 32.5) AS both_conditions_met
  FROM my_info_table
  WHERE period = '1950 - 1955';
- Result:
  life expectancy total: 50.9; cdr: 15.5; both_conditions_met: false

Assessment against the claim:
- life expectancy total > 70.1? No (50.9 is not greater than 70.1)
- cdr < 32.5? Yes (15.5 is less than 32.5)
- Combined (AND): false

Conclusion: The claim is false overall because the life expectancy condition is not met, even though the CDR condition is satisfied.

Assumptions made:
- “total life expectancy” maps to column “life expectancy total”.
- “cdr” maps to column cdr (crude death rate).
- The period reference is the exact text value '1950 - 1955' in my_info_table, representing the relevant entity captured by this dataset.
