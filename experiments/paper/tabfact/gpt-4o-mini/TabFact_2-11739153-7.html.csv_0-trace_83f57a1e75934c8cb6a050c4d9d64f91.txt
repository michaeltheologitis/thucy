Summary
The claim states that during the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the score was the same on February 27 and February 29. Using the authoritative table for that season, both dates correspond to games that ended with the same final score: 3 - 2.

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season
- Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Verify date format and sample entries
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 10;
Notes: Sample rows show the date column in the form 'February X', confirming the textual month-day format.

2) Retrieve games on February 27 and February 29 and compare scores
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home 
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season 
WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE '%february 27%' OR LOWER(date) LIKE '%february 29%';
Results:
- Date: February 27 | Visitor: Minnesota | Score: 3 - 2 | Home: Tampa Bay
- Date: February 29 | Visitor: Minnesota | Score: 3 - 2 | Home: Florida

Conclusion
Both games on February 27 and February 29 in the 2007–08 season had the same final score: 3 - 2. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Score” refers to the final game score reported in the table’s score column.
- The date column is text (month day) without a year; given the table is for the 2007–08 season, February refers to February 2008.
- Because the date is stored as free text, a case-insensitive LIKE filter was used to ensure correct matching.
