Claim to verify: "the average of all the home team score be 15.67"

Data source discovered
- Database: PostgreSQL (default connection)
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
  - Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Step 1: Confirm score format
Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score" FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season LIMIT 5;
Result (samples):
- footscray — 14.7 (91)
- fitzroy — 16.14 (110)
- essendon — 13.12 (90)
- carlton — 20.8 (128)
- hawthorn — 19.14 (128)
Interpretation: The field "home team score" uses the goals.behinds (total points) format.

Step 2: Count rows (context)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Result: 6 rows

Step 3: Average of home team total points (if "score" means points)
Executed SQL:
SELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS average_home_team_points
FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Result: 103.33
Conclusion for points: The average home team total points is 103.33, not 15.67.

Step 4: Average of home team goals (if "score" is interpreted as goals)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS n, ROUND(AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '^(\d+)') AS NUMERIC)), 2) AS avg_home_goals FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
Results: n = 6, avg_home_goals = 15.33
Conclusion for goals: The average home team goals is 15.33, not 15.67.

Overall conclusion
- Under the two most plausible interpretations of "home team score":
  - Total points average = 103.33 (not 15.67)
  - Goals average = 15.33 (not 15.67)
- Therefore, the claim that the average is 15.67 is not supported by the data available.

Assumptions and notes
- Assumed the relevant dataset is public.t_1972_vfl_season and that "home team score" refers to the goals.behinds (total points) format typical for VFL/AFL.
- Considered two interpretations: average total points and average goals. Neither matches 15.67 in this dataset of 6 rows.
