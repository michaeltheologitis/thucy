Claim to verify: The 15th place in the Liga (Primeira Liga) of the 2003–2004 season is associated with Estádio do Restelo, while the 13th place is associated with Estádio Cidade de Coimbra.

Data discovery and schema understanding:
- Available data source: public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga
- Relevant columns: club (text), head coach (text), city (text), stadium (text), 2003 - 2004 season (text)
- The 2003 - 2004 season column contains textual descriptors of each club’s status for that season (e.g., “13th in the liga”, “15th in the liga”).

Evidence retrieved from the data:
- Querying for rows where the stadium contains “Restelo” or “Coimbra” returned:
  - Club: académica de coimbra | Stadium: estádio cidade de coimbra | City: coimbra | 2003 - 2004 season: 13th in the liga
  - Club: belenenses | Stadium: estádio do restelo | City: lisbon | 2003 - 2004 season: 15th in the liga
  - (Also found: estoril - praia | estádio antónio coimbra da mota | 1st in the liga de honra — not directly relevant to the claim.)

This directly supports that:
- The entry labeled “15th in the liga” for 2003–2004 is tied to Estádio do Restelo (belenenses).
- The entry labeled “13th in the liga” for 2003–2004 is tied to Estádio Cidade de Coimbra (académica de coimbra).

Executed SQL (as returned by the query tool):
SELECT club, stadium, city, "2003 - 2004 season" 
FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga 
WHERE LOWER(stadium) LIKE '%restelo%' OR LOWER(stadium) LIKE '%coimbra%';

Conclusion: The data clearly confirms the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “the 15th in the liga” and “the 13th in the liga” to mean the clubs that finished 15th and 13th in the 2003–2004 Primeira Liga standings, respectively, and “be in/held in” to refer to their home stadiums as listed in the dataset for that season.
