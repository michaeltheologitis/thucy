Summary
- Claim interpreted as: the Detroit Lions finished a season with a 6–8 record.
- Available data source covers only the 1976 Detroit Lions season. Verification is therefore based on that season.

Data source discovery
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table: public.t_1976_detroit_lions_season (1976 Detroit Lions NFL season).

Schema inspection
- Table: t_1976_detroit_lions_season
  - Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)
  - The result column encodes game outcomes (e.g., starting with W, L, or T).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count wins, losses, ties
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result ILIKE 'W%') AS wins, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result ILIKE 'L%') AS losses, COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE result ILIKE 'T%') AS ties FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result:
- wins: 6
- losses: 8
- ties: 0

2) Total games played
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result:
- total_games: 14

Conclusion
- The 1976 Detroit Lions finished with a 6–8–0 record, which matches “6 wins and 8 losses.” Thus, under the available data scope, the claim is supported.

Assumptions
- “the lion” refers to the Detroit Lions NFL team.
- The unspecified season is taken to be 1976 because that is the only season available in the connected data source.
