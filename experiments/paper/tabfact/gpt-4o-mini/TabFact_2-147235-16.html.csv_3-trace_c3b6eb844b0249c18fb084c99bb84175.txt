Interpretation
- The dataset shows only one character entry with a metric value stated in kilograms: 担 / 擔 (60.478982 kg). All other listed units are represented in grams or milligrams.

Assumptions
- “Only character” is interpreted relative to the available chinese_units_of_measurement table.
- “Have a metric value measure in kg” is interpreted as the metric value text explicitly containing the unit label “kg,” as opposed to values expressed in g or mg.
- The combined entry “担 / 擔” is treated as one unit record in the dataset.
