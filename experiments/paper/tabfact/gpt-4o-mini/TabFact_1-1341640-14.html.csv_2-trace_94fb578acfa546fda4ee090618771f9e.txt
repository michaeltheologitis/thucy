Claim to verify: “In the Illinois 6th district, Republican Henry Hyde, incumbent since 1974, beat Democrat Mario Reymond Reda.”

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: A PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 (1980 U.S. House elections data).

Schema context
- Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980
  - Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (bigint), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence
1) Sample of records including Illinois 6 (executed SQL and returned row)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 LIMIT 10;
- Relevant returned row (excerpt):
  - District: Illinois 6
  - Incumbent: Henry Hyde
  - Party: Republican
  - First Elected: 1974
  - Result: Re-elected
  - Candidates: Henry Hyde (R) 67.0%, Mario Reymond Reda (D) 33.0%

2) Direct lookup for Illinois 6 (executed SQL and returned row)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1980 
  WHERE district ILIKE '%Illinois 6%';
- Returned row:
  - District: Illinois 6
  - Incumbent: Henry Hyde
  - Party: Republican
  - First Elected: 1974
  - Result: Re-elected
  - Candidates: Henry Hyde (R) 67.0%, Mario Reymond Reda (D) 33.0%

Assessment
- “Illinois 6th district”: Matches district = Illinois 6.
- “Republican Henry Hyde”: Matches incumbent = Henry Hyde, party = Republican.
- “Incumbent since 1974”: Matches "first elected" = 1974.
- “Beat Democrat Mario Reymond Reda”: Candidates field shows Henry Hyde (R) 67.0% vs Mario Reymond Reda (D) 33.0%, with result “Re-elected,” confirming Hyde defeated Reda in the 1980 general election.

Conclusion: The dataset directly supports all parts of the claim for the 1980 U.S. House election in Illinois’s 6th district.

Assumptions
- The verification is grounded in the 1980 U.S. House election data available in the connected database. If the claim intended a different election year, that is outside the scope of the accessible data; however, the statement as written is fully satisfied by the 1980 result.
