Claim interpreted: The Bell 212 (Twin Huey) is a trainer-type aircraft.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.uruguayan_air_force (columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, in service). This dataset is treated as authoritative within its scope.

Evidence 1: Classification of Bell 212 in the dataset
- Result: Aircraft: Bell 212 Twin Huey; Type: Transport / Utility; Versions: Bell 212
- Executed SQL:
SELECT aircraft, type, versions FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%Bell 212%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%Twin Huey%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%UH-1N%'

Evidence 2: Which aircraft are explicitly labeled as Trainer
- Result (subset of rows with Trainer in type):
  1) beechcraft b58 baron — type: trainer / liaison
  2) aermacchi sf260 — type: trainer
  3) pilatus pc - 7 turbo trainer — type: trainer
  4) cessna t - 41 mescalero — type: trainer
- Executed SQL:
SELECT aircraft, type FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE type ILIKE '%Trainer%';

Analysis
- The table explicitly categorizes aircraft by type. The entry for Bell 212 Twin Huey is categorized as Transport / Utility, not Trainer. The dataset also uses the label Trainer for other aircraft where applicable, indicating that if the Bell 212 were treated as a trainer in this dataset, it would be labeled accordingly.

Conclusion
- Based on the available authoritative dataset, the Bell 212 (Twin Huey) is not classified as a trainer-type aircraft; it is classified as Transport / Utility.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the aircraft type/classification field as represented in the available dataset.
- Verification is grounded in the Uruguayan Air Force dataset; broader global usage is not assessed beyond this data source.
