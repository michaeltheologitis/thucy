Assessment
- The dataset explicitly records, for the Pistons’ game vs Dallas, “High Points: Austin Daye (16)”.
- This verifies that Austin Daye scored 16 and was the Pistons’ leading scorer for that game versus Dallas.
- The table does not include Dallas Mavericks players’ stats, so we cannot verify whether 16 was the game-high across both teams. The “high points” column refers to the Pistons’ high scorer.

Conclusion
The claim that “player austin daye (16) score the highest number of point in the game and the team be dallas” is supported insofar as the Pistons’ recorded “High Points” vs Dallas is “Austin Daye (16)”. The part implying overall game-high across both teams cannot be confirmed from this dataset.

Assumptions
- “(16)” refers to points scored (as represented in the “high points” column format “player name (points)”).
- “score the highest number of point in the game” is interpreted as the Pistons’ team-high for that game, since that is what the table’s “high points” column represents.
