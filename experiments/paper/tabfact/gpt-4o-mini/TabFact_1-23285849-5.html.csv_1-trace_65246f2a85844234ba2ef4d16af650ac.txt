Claim to verify: “the nugget win all 6 game play at the pepsi center during this span.”

Interpretation: We interpret “this span” as the time window covered by the available dataset for the Denver Nuggets’ 2009–10 season, and “Pepsi Center” as home games (location_attendance starting with “pepsi center”). We verify whether every game at the Pepsi Center in this dataset was a win, and how many such games there were.

Data source overview:
- Table: t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
  Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)

Evidence 1: List all home (Pepsi Center) games with results
Executed SQL:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance" AS loc_att
FROM "t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season"
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE 'pepsi center%'
ORDER BY game;

Result (abridged to key fields):
- Game 3 | November 1 | Grizzlies | W 133 - 123 (OT) | Pepsi Center 15823
- Game 10 | November 13 | Lakers | W 105 - 79 (OT) | Pepsi Center 19141
- Game 11 | November 17 | Raptors | W 130 - 112 (OT) | Pepsi Center 16446
- Game 13 | November 21 | Bulls | W 112 - 93 (OT) | Pepsi Center 19359
- Game 14 | November 24 | Nets | W 101 - 87 (OT) | Pepsi Center 16307
- Game 16 | November 27 | Knicks | W 128 - 125 (OT) | Pepsi Center 19155
All six home games listed show wins (score begins with “W”).

Evidence 2: Aggregate counts of home games, wins, losses
Executed SQL:
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS home_games,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(score) LIKE 'w %' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN lower(score) LIKE 'l %' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_losses
FROM "t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season"
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE 'pepsi center%';

Result:
- home_games = 6
- home_wins = 6
- home_losses = 0

Evidence 3: Span of the home games in this dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(date) AS first_home_game_date, MAX(date) AS last_home_game_date
FROM "t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season"
WHERE lower("location attendance") LIKE 'pepsi center%';

Result:
- first_home_game_date = November 1
- last_home_game_date = November 27

Conclusion:
- Within the dataset’s span, the Nuggets played 6 games at the Pepsi Center and won all 6. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “This span” refers to the period covered by the provided 2009–10 dataset (which includes games through at least November 27), not the entire NBA season.
- “Pepsi Center” indicates home games, identified by location_attendance starting with “pepsi center”.
