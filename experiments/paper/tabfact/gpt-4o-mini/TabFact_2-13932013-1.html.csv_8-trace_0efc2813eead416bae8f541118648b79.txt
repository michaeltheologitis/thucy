Summary of claim
- Claim: “only 10 Cleveland Browns quarterbacks have won more than 30 games.”
- Interpretation: Count of distinct Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks whose wins (as a starter) exceed 30, based on the authoritative dataset available.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing a single relevant table: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.

Schema details (for grounding)
- Table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
  - quarterback (text): Name of the quarterback
  - uniform no (s) (text): Uniform number(s)
  - games started (bigint)
  - wins (bigint)
  - losses (bigint)
  - ties (bigint)
  - winning pct (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count of QBs with more than 30 wins
- Result: 6
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS quarterback_count
FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE wins > 30;

2) List of QBs with more than 30 wins, ordered by wins
- Result (name — wins):
  - Brian Sipe — 57
  - Otto Graham — 57
  - Bernie Kosar — 53
  - Frank Ryan — 52
  - Bill Nelsen — 34
  - Milt Plum — 33
- SQL executed:
SELECT quarterback, wins 
FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks 
WHERE wins > 30 
ORDER BY wins DESC;

3) Sensitivity check (30 or more wins)
- Result: 6
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS quarterback_count
FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
WHERE wins >= 30;

Conclusion
- The data shows 6 quarterbacks with more than 30 wins as starters for the Cleveland Browns, not 10. Even when including quarterbacks with exactly 30 wins (>= 30), the count remains 6.

Assumptions
- “Wins” refers to wins as a starting quarterback for the Cleveland Browns, as represented by the wins column in the list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks table.
- The dataset is treated as authoritative and complete for the scope of this verification.
