Claim to verify: “gold coast blaze win the most game in the season.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_09_nbl_season (columns: team, lost, last 5, streak, home, away, % pts, % won)

Step 1 — Inspect season data
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, lost, "last 5", streak, home, away, "% pts", "% won" FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season;

Key observations from the returned rows (2008–09 NBL season data):
- Gold Coast Blaze: lost=22, home="6 - 9", away="2 - 13", % won=26.67
- South Dragons: lost=8, home="13 - 2", away="9 - 6", % won=73.33
- Other teams’ records are also present.

Step 2 — Compute total wins per team and rank
Executed SQL (wins computed from home/away wins, then sorted):
SELECT team, wins, lost, "% won" 
FROM (SELECT team, 
            (CAST(SUBSTRING(home FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) + 
            CAST(SUBSTRING(away FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER)) AS wins, 
            lost, 
            "% won" 
        FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season) AS derived 
ORDER BY wins DESC;

Result highlights returned by the query:
- South Dragons: 22 wins, 8 losses, 73.33% won (most wins)
- Melbourne Tigers: 20 wins, 10 losses
- New Zealand Breakers: 18 wins, 12 losses
- Perth Wildcats: 17 wins, 13 losses
- Townsville Crocodiles: 17 wins, 13 losses
- Adelaide 36ers: 15 wins, 15 losses
- Wollongong Hawks: 11 wins, 19 losses
- Sydney Spirit: 11 wins, 19 losses
- Cairns Taipans: 11 wins, 19 losses
- Gold Coast Blaze: 8 wins, 22 losses, 26.67% won (fewest wins)

Conclusion
- The data show South Dragons had the most wins (22) in the season captured by this table (2008–09 NBL), while Gold Coast Blaze had 8 wins, the fewest. Therefore, the claim that “Gold Coast Blaze win the most game in the season” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win the most game in the season” as “finished the season with the most wins among all teams in the season represented by the available dataset,” which is the 2008–09 Australian NBL season contained in public.t_2008_09_nbl_season.
