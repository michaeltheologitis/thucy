Summary of verification
- Claim interpreted: “Three of the games at the US Airways Center have the same attendance.” We verify this within the available dataset (Phoenix Suns 2008–09 table with 8 rows), treating entries whose location begins with “us airways center” as games at that venue and “same attendance” as identical numeric attendance in the location field.

Evidence from data
1) Identify repeated attendance values for US Airways Center
- Result: The value “us airways center 18422” appears 3 times. One additional US Airways Center entry has no attendance number.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "location attendance", COUNT(*) AS attendance_count 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
  WHERE "location attendance" LIKE 'us airways center%'
  GROUP BY "location attendance" 
  ORDER BY attendance_count DESC;
- Returned rows (abridged):
  • us airways center 18422 — 3
  • us airways center — 1

2) Count checks to corroborate the grouping
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE "location attendance" LIKE 'us airways center%';
  → 4

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE "location attendance" = 'us airways center 18422';
  → 3

  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season WHERE "location attendance" = 'us airways center';
  → 1

3) List the specific games that share the attendance 18422
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, record 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season 
  WHERE "location attendance" = 'us airways center 18422' 
  ORDER BY game;
- Returned rows:
  • Game 75 | Date: April 1 | Team: Houston | Record: 41 - 34
  • Game 76 | Date: April 3 | Team: Sacramento | Record: 42 - 34
  • Game 81 | Date: April 13 | Team: Memphis | Record: 45 - 36

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly three games at the US Airways Center with identical attendance (18422). Therefore, the claim is supported by the data available.

Assumptions
- “At the US Airways Center” is interpreted as rows where the location string begins with “us airways center”.
- “Same attendance” means identical numeric attendance value embedded in the location field.
- Verification is limited to the scope of the available table (8 games from the 2008–09 season), which is treated as authoritative within its scope.
