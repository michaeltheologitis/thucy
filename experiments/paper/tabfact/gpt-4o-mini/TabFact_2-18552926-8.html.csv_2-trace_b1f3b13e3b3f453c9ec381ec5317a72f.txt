Scope and interpretation
- Claim interpreted as: “The earliest year when the result is ‘nominated’ and the role/episode is ‘Fox Mulder’ is 1996.”
- We searched the authoritative table of awards/nominations for The X-Files, specifically looking for entries where the role/episode references Fox Mulder and the result indicates a nomination.

Data sources discovered
- Database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Table: public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
  - Columns: year (bigint), category (text), "recipients and nominees" (text), "role / episode" (text), result (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all entries with role/episode containing “Fox Mulder”
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, category, "recipients and nominees", "role / episode", result 
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files 
WHERE "role / episode" ILIKE '%Fox Mulder%' 
ORDER BY year ASC;
Result:
- Year: 1996 | Category: best actor in a leading role - drama series | Recipients and Nominees: David Duchovny | Role / Episode: Fox Mulder | Result: Won

2) Check for any nominations where role/episode includes “Mulder” (to cover variations) and result indicates a nomination
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, category, "recipients and nominees", "role / episode", result 
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files 
WHERE "role / episode" ILIKE '%Mulder%' AND result ILIKE 'nominat%'
ORDER BY year ASC;
Result: No rows returned.

3) Compute the earliest year (MIN) for nominations with role/episode including “Mulder”
Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year
FROM public.list_of_awards_and_nominations_received_by_the_x_files
WHERE "role / episode" ILIKE '%Mulder%' AND result ILIKE 'nominat%';
Result: min_year = NULL (no matching entries)

Conclusion
- There are no entries where the role/episode is Fox Mulder and the result is a nomination. The only Fox Mulder entry found (1996) has result = Won, not Nominated. Therefore, the claim that the earliest such year is 1996 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “nominate” was interpreted as any result matching ILIKE 'nominat%' (e.g., 'nominated').
- “role / episode be fox mulder” was treated as case-insensitive match where the "role / episode" field contains the text “Fox Mulder”.
