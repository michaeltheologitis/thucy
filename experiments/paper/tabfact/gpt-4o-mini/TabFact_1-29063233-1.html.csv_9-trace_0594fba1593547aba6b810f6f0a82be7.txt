Claim: “beauty and the beast (part 2) have less uk viewer than beauty and the beast (part 1)”.

Data checked: Merlin Series 2 episode ratings in the available database.

Findings from the data:
- beauty and the beast (part 1): 5.53 million UK viewers
- beauty and the beast (part 2): 6.14 million UK viewers

Conclusion from evidence: Part 2 has more UK viewers than Part 1, not less. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) SELECT title, "uk viewers (million)" FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE title ILIKE '%Beauty and the Beast%';
2) SELECT title, "uk viewers (million)" FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE title ILIKE '%Beauty and the Beast%' ORDER BY "no for series";

Assumptions made:
- “beauty and the beast (part 1/part 2)” refers to the Merlin Series 2 two-part story as represented in the table merlin_series_2.
- “UK viewer” refers to the “uk viewers (million)” metric in the dataset.
- Minor differences in capitalization or punctuation of titles do not affect identification of the episodes.
