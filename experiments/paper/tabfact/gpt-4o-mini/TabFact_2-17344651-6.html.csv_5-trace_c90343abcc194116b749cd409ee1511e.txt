Claim: “the boston celtic lose more game than they win in the 1984 - 1985 season.”

Data discovery and schema
- Data source: TabFact database
- Available table: public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), score (text), location (text), record (text; team’s cumulative record after each game)

Evidence gathered
1) Identify the last game recorded and its cumulative record
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(game) AS max_game FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: max_game = 46

- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1;
- Result (key fields): game = 46, date = 'wed jan 30', opponent = 'Philadelphia 76ers', score = '104 - 122', location = 'The Spectrum', record = '37 - 9'

2) Parse wins and losses from the last available cumulative record
- SQL:
  SELECT record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1;
- Result: '37 - 9'

- SQL:
  SELECT SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 1)::int AS wins, SPLIT_PART(record, ' - ', 2)::int AS losses FROM (SELECT record FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season ORDER BY game DESC LIMIT 1) AS last_game;
- Result: wins = 37, losses = 9

3) Check the maximum date recorded to understand coverage
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(date) AS max_date FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season;
- Result: 'wed jan 9'

Interpretation
- The last available cumulative record in the dataset shows 37 wins and 9 losses at game 46. This clearly indicates more wins than losses in the portion of the season captured by the data.
- The dataset appears to cover games through late January (up to game 46), not the entire season, but within the recorded data the Celtics did not lose more games than they won.

Conclusion
- The available data contradicts the claim: the Celtics had far more wins than losses in the recorded portion of the 1984–85 season (37–9). Therefore, the claim that they lost more games than they won is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and limitations
- The table appears to capture only part of the 1984–85 season (dates shown are through January; max game number is 46). While this does not include the full season, the evidence within the recorded range is sufficient to contradict the claim’s core assertion that they lost more games than they won.
