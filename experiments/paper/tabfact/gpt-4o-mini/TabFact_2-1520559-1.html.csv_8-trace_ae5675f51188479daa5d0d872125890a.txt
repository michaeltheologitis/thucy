Claim to verify: “Jiyal (Jiyai) Shin champion by beat Inbee Park in the 2010 Open with 9 stroke.”

Data source discovered:
- PostgreSQL database containing a table of Women’s British Open results: public.women_s_british_open

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Query to retrieve the 2010 and 2012 Women’s British Open rows
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.women_s_british_open WHERE year IN (2010, 2012) ORDER BY year ASC;

Returned rows:
- 2010 | July 29 - Aug 1 | Royal Birkdale Golf Club | Yani Tseng | Taiwan | 277 | -11 | 1 stroke | Katherine Hull | 2500000 | 408714
- 2012 | Sep 13 - 16 | Royal Liverpool Golf Club | Jiyai Shin | South Korea | 279 | -9 | 9 strokes | Inbee Park | 2750000 | 428650

Analysis:
- For 2010, the champion was Yani Tseng, winning by 1 stroke over Katherine Hull (not Jiyai Shin over Inbee Park by 9).
- For 2012, Jiyai Shin won by 9 strokes over Inbee Park. This matches the margin and opponent in the claim but is for 2012, not 2010.

Conclusion: The claim misstates the year. The correct statement is that Jiyai Shin defeated Inbee Park by 9 strokes at the 2012 Women’s British Open, not in 2010.

Assumptions made:
- “Open” refers to the Women’s British Open (LPGA major).
- “Jiyal Shin” refers to Jiyai Shin.
- “9 stroke” means a 9-stroke margin of victory.
