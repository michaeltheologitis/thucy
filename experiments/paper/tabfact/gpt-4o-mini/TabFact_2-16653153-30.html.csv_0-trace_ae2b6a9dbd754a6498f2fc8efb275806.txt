Claim interpreted: “South Dragon win the most game in the season.” Interpreted as: Did the South Dragons finish with the most wins (best record) in the available season dataset?

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: TabFact (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.t_2008_09_nbl_season (team-level season summary for the 2008–09 NBL season)
  - Columns: team (text), lost (bigint), last 5 (text), streak (text), home (text), away (text), % pts (double precision), % won (double precision)

Evidence
1) Identify the top team by win percentage (proxy for most wins in a balanced schedule)
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, lost, "% won" FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season ORDER BY "% won" DESC LIMIT 1;
Result (from tool): South Dragons | 8 losses | 73.33% win percentage

2) Show full ordering to compare all teams
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, lost, "% won" FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season ORDER BY "% won" DESC;
Top-to-bottom results (from tool):
- South Dragons — Lost: 8 — % Won: 73.33
- Melbourne Tigers — Lost: 10 — % Won: 66.67
- New Zealand Breakers — Lost: 12 — % Won: 60.00
- Perth Wildcats — Lost: 13 — % Won: 56.67
- Townsville Crocodiles — Lost: 13 — % Won: 56.67
- Adelaide 36ers — Lost: 15 — % Won: 50.00
- Wollongong Hawks — Lost: 19 — % Won: 36.67
- Sydney Spirit — Lost: 19 — % Won: 36.67
- Cairns Taipans — Lost: 19 — % Won: 36.67
- Gold Coast Blaze — Lost: 22 — % Won: 26.67

Assessment
- The South Dragons have the highest win percentage (73.33%) and the fewest losses (8) among all listed teams in the 2008–09 NBL season table. In a standard season where teams play the same number of games, the team with the highest win percentage corresponds to the team with the most wins. The data therefore supports the claim that the South Dragons won the most games in this season dataset.

Assumptions
- “South Dragon” refers to the NBL team “South Dragons.”
- “the season” refers to the available 2008–09 NBL season in the connected dataset.
- Teams played a balanced schedule; thus, ranking by win percentage is equivalent to ranking by total wins.
