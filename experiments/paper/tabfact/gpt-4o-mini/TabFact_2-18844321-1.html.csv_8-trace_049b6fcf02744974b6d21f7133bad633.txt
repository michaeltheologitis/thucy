Claim to verify: “All 5 matches held in October of 1978 take place after the 25th of the month.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland (records from the 1978 New Zealand rugby union tour)

Schema highlights
- Columns: opposing team (text), against (bigint), date (text, e.g., '18 October 1978'), venue (text), status (text)
- The date column is text and must be parsed for date comparisons.

Evidence
1) List of October 1978 matches with parsed dates and whether they occur after October 25, 1978
SQL executed:
SELECT date,
       TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_date,
       EXTRACT(DAY FROM TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY')) AS day_of_month,
       (TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') > '1978-10-25') AS occurred_after_oct_25
FROM public.t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') >= '1978-10-01' 
AND TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') < '1978-11-01'
ORDER BY parsed_date ASC;

Result rows:
- 18 October 1978  | day 18 | occurred_after_oct_25: No
- 21 October 1978  | day 21 | occurred_after_oct_25: No
- 25 October 1978  | day 25 | occurred_after_oct_25: No
- 28 October 1978  | day 28 | occurred_after_oct_25: Yes
- 31 October 1978  | day 31 | occurred_after_oct_25: Yes

2) Counts for October 1978: total matches and those after Oct 25
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches,
       COUNT(CASE WHEN TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') > TO_DATE('25 October 1978', 'DD Month YYYY') THEN 1 END) AS matches_after_25th
FROM t_1978_new_zealand_rugby_union_tour_of_britain_and_ireland
WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') >= TO_DATE('01 October 1978', 'DD Month YYYY')
  AND TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') < TO_DATE('01 November 1978', 'DD Month YYYY');

Results:
- total_matches: 5
- matches_after_25th: 2

Conclusion
- There were 5 matches in October 1978.
- Only 2 of these occurred after the 25th (on the 28th and 31st). Three matches were on or before the 25th (18th, 21st, and 25th).
- Therefore, the claim that “all 5 matches held in October of 1978 take place after the 25th” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “match hold” as “matches held.”
- Interpreted “after the 25th” as strictly later than October 25 (i.e., dates > 1978-10-25).
