Claim to verify: "the toronto blue jay win 2 of the last 3 game they play in may 1991"

Data discovery and schema
- Available data source: Database TabFact, schema public, table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (Toronto Blue Jays 1991 season)
- Relevant columns: date (text, e.g., 'may 1'), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text; losing pitcher), attendance (bigint), record (text, e.g., '12 - 10' indicating team record after the game)

Step 1: Retrieve all May 1991 games to identify the last three dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record, EXTRACT(DAY FROM TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD')) AS day_num
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
WHERE date LIKE 'may%'
ORDER BY day_num ASC;

Returned evidence (excerpt for end of month):
- may 28 | athletics | 8 - 4 | acker (1 - 2) | 25 - 20
- may 29 | athletics | 8 - 3 | slusarski (1 - 2) | 26 - 20
- may 30 | athletics | 8 - 6 | ward (0 - 2) | 26 - 21
- may 31 | angels | 5 - 1 | langston (6 - 2) | 27 - 21
This shows the last three games in May are on May 29, May 30, and May 31.

Step 2: Retrieve the last four days to show consecutive records and infer outcomes by record changes
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, record 
FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE date IN ('may 28', 'may 29', 'may 30', 'may 31') 
ORDER BY CAST(SUBSTRING(date FROM '\\d+') AS INTEGER);

Returned rows:
- May 28 | Athletics | 8 - 4 | acker (1 - 2) | 25 - 20
- May 29 | Athletics | 8 - 3 | slusarski (1 - 2) | 26 - 20
- May 30 | Athletics | 8 - 6 | ward (0 - 2) | 26 - 21
- May 31 | Angels    | 5 - 1 | langston (6 - 2)  | 27 - 21

Outcome inference using record deltas (wins-losses after each game):
- May 29: Record moved from 25-20 (May 28) to 26-20 → win
- May 30: Record moved from 26-20 (May 29) to 26-21 → loss
- May 31: Record moved from 26-21 (May 30) to 27-21 → win

Result: Among the last three games in May (29, 30, 31), the Blue Jays won exactly 2 (May 29 and May 31).

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season exclusively covers the 1991 season; thus all 'may N' dates are in May 1991.
- "Last 3 games in May" is interpreted as the games on the final three calendar dates present in May: May 29, May 30, and May 31.
