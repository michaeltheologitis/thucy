Claim to verify: “the yugoslavian national team win both of its friendly match by a score 0:2.”

Data source discovered
- Database: PostgreSQL sports results database
- Table: public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date [text], city [text], opponent [text], results [text], type of game [text])

Step 1: Identify how friendly matches are labeled
Query (distinct game types):
SELECT "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results GROUP BY "type of game";
Result: Balkan Cup; Friendly; 1982 WCQ

Step 2: Count total matches and number of friendlies
Query (total rows):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results;
Result: 7

Query (counts per type of game):
SELECT "type of game", COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results GROUP BY "type of game";
Result: Balkan Cup = 2; Friendly = 2; 1982 WCQ = 3

Step 3: Retrieve all rows to inspect the friendly match results
Query (all rows):
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results;
Returned rows:
- March 22 | Sarajevo | Uruguay    | 2:1 | Friendly
- March 30 | Belgrade | Romania    | 2:0 | Balkan Cup
- April 26 | Borovo   | Poland     | 2:1 | Friendly
- August 27 | Bucharest, Romania | Romania | 1:4 | Balkan Cup
- September 10 | Luxembourg | Luxembourg | 5:0 | 1982 WCQ
- September 27 | Ljubljana | Denmark | 2:1 | 1982 WCQ
- November 15 | Torino, Italy | Italy | 0:2 | 1982 WCQ

Findings from Step 3:
- There are exactly two friendlies, and Yugoslavia won both (2:1 vs Uruguay; 2:1 vs Poland).
- Neither friendly ended 0:2.

Step 4: Check if any match ended 0:2 and what type it was
Query (results = '0:2'):
SELECT date, city, opponent, "type of game" FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results WHERE results = '0:2';
Result: November 15 | Torino, Italy | Italy | 1982 WCQ
Interpretation: The only 0:2 score in the dataset is a World Cup qualifier against Italy, not a friendly, and it indicates a loss for Yugoslavia (0 scored by Yugoslavia, 2 by opponent) given the consistent results format in other matches.

Conclusion
- True: Yugoslavia won both of its friendly matches.
- False: They did not win those friendlies by 0:2; both friendlies ended 2:1 in Yugoslavia’s favor.
- Therefore, the claim incorrectly specifies the scoreline for the friendlies.

Assumptions
- The 'results' field is recorded from Yugoslavia’s perspective (supported by friendly results 2:1, which align with wins, and by the 0:2 result aligning with a loss).
