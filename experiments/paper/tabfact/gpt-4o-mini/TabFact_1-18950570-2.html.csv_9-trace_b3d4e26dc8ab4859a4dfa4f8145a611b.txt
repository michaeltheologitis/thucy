Claim to verify: “In the period where there are 900,000 deaths per year, there are also 2,500,000 natural change per year.”

Approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected schema.
- Queried the demographic table for periods matching the stated conditions.
- Cross-checked nearby values to ensure no near-match could validate the claim.

Data source discovery
- Purpose: Identify available tables.
- SQL executed:
  1) SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type='BASE TABLE';
  2) SELECT schemaname, tablename FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables;
- Result (excerpt): public.my_info_table exists.

Schema inspection of public.my_info_table
- Purpose: Understand columns and data types; view sample rows.
- SQL executed:
  1) SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'my_info_table' AND table_schema = 'public';
  2) SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table LIMIT 5;
- Key columns: period (text), "live births per year" (text), "deaths per year" (text), "natural change per year" (text), plus rate indicators (cbr, cdr, nc, tfr, imr, life expectancy).
- Sample row shows internal consistency: For 1950 - 1955, live births per year = 2 572 000; deaths per year = 900 000; natural change per year = 1 672 000 (births − deaths = 2,572,000 − 900,000 = 1,672,000).

Verification step 1: Find period(s) with exactly 900,000 deaths per year and report natural change
- SQL executed:
  SELECT period, "deaths per year", "natural change per year" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE REPLACE("deaths per year", ' ', '') = '900000';
- Result:
  • Period: 1950 - 1955; Deaths per Year: 900,000; Natural Change per Year: 1,672,000.
- Interpretation: In the only period with exactly 900,000 deaths per year, the natural change per year is 1,672,000 (not 2,500,000).

Verification step 2: Check if any period has exactly 2,500,000 natural change per year
- SQL executed:
  SELECT period, "natural change per year", "deaths per year" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE REPLACE("natural change per year", ' ', '') = '2500000';
- Result: No rows found.

Verification step 3: Check for periods with natural change close to 2.5 million (±50,000) and see deaths
- SQL executed:
  SELECT period, "natural change per year", "deaths per year" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE CAST(REPLACE("natural change per year", ' ', '') AS BIGINT) BETWEEN 2450000 AND 2550000 ORDER BY CAST(REPLACE("natural change per year", ' ', '') AS BIGINT);
- Results:
  • 1990 - 1995: Natural change = 2,461,000; Deaths per year = 1,058,000.
  • 1995 - 2000: Natural change = 2,538,000; Deaths per year = 1,086,000.
- Interpretation: Periods with natural change around 2.5 million correspond to deaths >1,000,000 per year, not 900,000.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that the period with 900,000 deaths per year (1950 - 1955) had a natural change of 1,672,000, not 2,500,000.
- No period has exactly 2,500,000 natural change per year; near-2.5M natural change periods had deaths over 1,000,000 per year.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Per year” values in the table are already annualized figures for the multi-year periods listed.
- “Natural change per year” means births minus deaths per year, consistent with the sample row.
- The table represents the relevant population context for the claim (country/region unspecified).
