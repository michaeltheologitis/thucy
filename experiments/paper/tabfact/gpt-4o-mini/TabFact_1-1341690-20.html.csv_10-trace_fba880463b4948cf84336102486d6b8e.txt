Claim assessed: “Parren Mitchell was re-elected for Maryland’s 8th congressional district.”

Conclusion: The available authoritative 1974 U.S. House election data show Parren Mitchell was re-elected in Maryland’s 7th district, not the 8th. There is no 1974 record for “Maryland 8” in the dataset. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate (within the scope of the accessible data).

Data source discovery
- Available database: a PostgreSQL dataset with a single table of 1974 U.S. House elections.
  - Table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974

Schema details (from the schema tool)
- Columns:
  - district (text)
  - incumbent (text)
  - party (text)
  - first elected (bigint)
  - result (text)
  - candidates (text)

Evidence from executed queries
1) Maryland 1974 House election records (confirms Parren Mitchell’s district and status)
- Result excerpt: Includes “Maryland 7” with incumbent Parren Mitchell (D), first elected 1970, result: Re-elected; candidates: Parren Mitchell (D) Unopposed.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974;

2) Check specifically for a 1974 record of “Maryland 8”
- Result: 0 rows (no record for “Maryland 8” in this 1974 table).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 WHERE district = 'Maryland 8';

3) Verify where “Parren” appears in 1974 data
- Result: One row only — District: Maryland 7; Incumbent: Parren Mitchell; Result: Re-elected; Candidates: Parren Mitchell (D) Unopposed.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT district, incumbent, result, candidates 
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
  WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%Parren%' OR candidates ILIKE '%Parren%';

Assessment
- The data directly ties Parren Mitchell to Maryland’s 7th district in 1974 and shows he was re-elected there.
- There is no 1974 record for Maryland’s 8th district in this dataset, and no record linking Parren Mitchell to an 8th-district seat.

Answer: The claim that Parren Mitchell was re-elected for Maryland’s 8th district is not supported by the 1974 election data; he was re-elected in the 7th district.

Assumptions
- The question pertains to U.S. House of Representatives elections.
- Verification is constrained to the accessible authoritative dataset (1974 cycle).
