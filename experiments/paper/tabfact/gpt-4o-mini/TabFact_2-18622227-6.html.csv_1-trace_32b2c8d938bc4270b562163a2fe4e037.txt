Summary
- Interpreting the claim within the available dataset (TabFact.public.katrina_adams), which records Katrina Adams’ results by tournament and year, the “US Open” entry shows identical outcomes for 1986 and 1999.

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.katrina_adams
- Columns: tournament (text), and year columns including "1986" and "1999" (text)

Evidence
1) Query: list all tournaments with their 1986 and 1999 results
- SQL: SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM katrina_adams;
- Output (relevant row): tournament = us open, 1986 = 1r, 1999 = 1r

2) Query: retrieve the US Open row specifically
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'us open';
- Output (relevant fields): 1986 = 1r, 1999 = 1r

3) Query: extract only the 1986 and 1999 values for US Open
- SQL: SELECT "1986", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'us open';
- Output: 1986 = 1r, 1999 = 1r

Conclusion
- Based on the katrina_adams table, the US Open result for Katrina Adams in 1986 and 1999 is the same: 1r (first round). This supports the claim within the scope of this dataset.

Assumptions
- “US Open” refers to the tournament row labeled “us open” in the katrina_adams table.
- “Result” refers to Katrina Adams’ round reached (e.g., 1r = first round) in that tournament for the specified years.
- The claim is evaluated solely using the available dataset; it does not generalize to broader event winners or other players.
