  - Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), "sp + fs" (bigint), points (double precision), places (bigint)

Evidence gathered:
1) Locate records for Natalia Strelkova
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name = 'Natalia Strelkova';
- Result: No rows
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE name ILIKE '%Strelkova%';
- Result: name = natalia strelkova; nation = soviet union; places = 134; points = 164.94; rank = 13; "sp + fs" = 16

- Result: Name: Natalia Strelkova; Rank: 13; Points: 164.94; Places: 134

2) Determine last place (maximum rank) and who holds it
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
- Result: 31
- SQL: SELECT MAX(rank) AS max_rank FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;

3) Verify the 112.28 points figure
- SQL: SELECT name, rank FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE points = 112.28;
- Result: Name: Gloria Mas; Rank: 31
- SQL: SELECT MIN(points) AS min_points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships;
- Result: 112.28
- SQL: SELECT name, rank, points FROM public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships WHERE points = 112.28;

Assessment of the claim components:
- "natalia strelkova come in last place": Not supported. Data shows Natalia Strelkova ranked 13th (not last). Last place (rank 31 of 31) is Gloria Mas.
- "with 112.28 point": Not supported for Natalia Strelkova. She has 164.94 points. The 112.28 points belong to Gloria Mas, who is last.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data. Natalia Strelkova did not come in last place and did not have 112.28 points.

Assumptions made:
- "Last place" is interpreted as the highest numerical rank in the table (max rank = 31), which is standard in ranking.
- The claim pertains to the dataset represented by public.t_1979_world_figure_skating_championships (1979 World Figure Skating Championships).
