Claim to verify: “the toronto blue jay play in 8 game with an attendance lower than 5000 in may of the 1991 season.”

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season
- Columns:
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)
  - loss (text)
  - attendance (bigint)
  - record (text)

Note on date format: Sample rows show date values like “may 1”, “may 2”, etc., so filtering for May is done via LOWER(date) LIKE 'may %'.

Evidence
1) Count of May games with attendance < 5,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) 
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'may %' AND attendance < 5000;
- Result: 0

2) List any May games with attendance < 5,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance 
  FROM t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'may %' AND attendance < 5000;
- Result: no rows

3) Context: total May games and minimum May attendance
- Executed SQL (total May games):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS may_games 
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'may %';
- Result: 27 May games
- Executed SQL (minimum May attendance):
  SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance 
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'may %';
- Result: 20,809 minimum attendance in May

4) Season-wide check for any game with attendance < 5,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE attendance < 5000;
- Result: 0

Conclusion
- The data shows zero Toronto Blue Jays games in May 1991 with attendance below 5,000 (and none below 5,000 in the entire 1991 season). Therefore, the claim that there were 8 such games is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Toronto Blue Jay” refers to the Toronto Blue Jays MLB team.
- The t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season table contains all 1991 regular-season games for the team, with attendance recorded per game.
- “May of the 1991 season” is interpreted as all games with date values beginning with “may ” in this table.
