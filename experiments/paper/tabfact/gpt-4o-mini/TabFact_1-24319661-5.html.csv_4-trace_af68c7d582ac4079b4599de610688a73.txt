What I verified (scope and interpretation)
- I interpreted your claim as referring to the TV series “White Collar,” asking whether Paul Holahan directed only one episode in each of Seasons 1 through 6, or was the sole director for those seasons. I grounded this in the available data source for White Collar episodes.
- Available data: The connected database (TabFact) exposes a single table, public.list_of_white_collar_episodes, which contains entries for White Collar Season 4 (episodes 1–15; series numbers 47–61). No data for Seasons 1–3, 5, or 6 is present. Therefore, I can directly verify only what the dataset contains (Season 4) and cannot claim facts about other seasons from this source.

What the data shows
1) All Season 4 episodes and directors (evidence)
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "directed by", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
ORDER BY "no in series" ASC;

Result (abridged to essential points relevant to Holahan):
- No. in Series 47 / Season ep 1: “Wanted” — Directed by Paul Holahan (July 10, 2012)
- No. in Series 48 / Season ep 2: “Most Wanted” — Directed by Paul Holahan (July 17, 2012)
- No. in Series 53 / Season ep 7: “Compromising Positions” — Directed by Paul Holahan (Aug 28, 2012)
- No. in Series 57 / Season ep 11: “Family Business” — Directed by Paul Holahan (Jan 22, 2013)

This list also shows multiple other directors for the remaining Season 4 episodes (e.g., Stefan Schwartz, Robert Duncan McNeill, Arlene Sanford, David Straiton, Russell Lee Fine, Renny Harlin, Anton Cropper, Tim DeKay, John Kretchmer), confirming Paul Holahan was not the sole director for season 4.

2) Count of Season 4 episodes directed by Paul Holahan (evidence)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS holahan_count
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%paul holahan%';

Result:
- holahan_count = 4

3) The specific Season 4 episodes directed by Paul Holahan (evidence)
SQL executed:
SELECT "no in season" AS episode_in_season, title, "directed by", "original air date"
FROM public.list_of_white_collar_episodes
WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE '%paul holahan%'
ORDER BY "no in series";

Result:
- Episode 1: “Wanted” — Paul Holahan — July 10, 2012
- Episode 2: “Most Wanted” — Paul Holahan — July 17, 2012
- Episode 7: “Compromising Positions” — Paul Holahan — August 28, 2012
- Episode 11: “Family Business” — Paul Holahan — January 22, 2013

Conclusion
- Within the data we have (Season 4), Paul Holahan directed four episodes. This contradicts any reading of “only” as “exactly one episode per season,” since in Season 4 alone he directed multiple episodes. It also contradicts any notion that he was the sole director for the seasons in question, as Season 4 clearly has several different directors.
- Because the database does not include Seasons 1–3, 5, or 6, I cannot confirm or deny his directing pattern in those seasons from this data. However, the part we can verify (Season 4) already disproves “only one” for that season.

Assumptions I made
- The claim pertains to the TV show White Collar.
- “Only direct episode for season 1 through season 6” is interpreted as “he directed only one episode in each of seasons 1–6” or “he was the only director for those seasons.” Under either interpretation, Season 4 data in this source contradicts the claim.
- The verification is strictly limited to the authoritative data accessible here, which only includes Season 4.
