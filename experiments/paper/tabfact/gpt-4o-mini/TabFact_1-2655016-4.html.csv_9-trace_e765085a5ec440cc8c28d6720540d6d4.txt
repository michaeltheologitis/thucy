Claim to verify: “season 2 and 10 both air in january, almost exactly 1 year apart.”

What I checked
- Whether Season 2 and Season 10 exist in the available dataset.
- The premiere date (earliest original air date) for Season 2 and Season 10.
- Whether both premiere in January.
- The number of days between those premiere dates.

Evidence from the data
1) Distinct seasons present
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes ORDER BY season ASC;
Result (excerpt): seasons include 2 and 10.

2) Sample episodes for Seasons 2 and 10 (to view dates)
SQL:
SELECT "episode title", "original air date" FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE season = 2 LIMIT 10;
SELECT "episode title", "original air date" FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE season = 10 LIMIT 10;
Results:
- Season 2: episode title = Montell Jordan; original air date = November 23, 1996
- Season 10: episode title = Chris Farley / Mint Condition; original air date = January 11, 1997

3) Premiere/finale dates and episode counts (dates parsed)
SQL:
SELECT season,
       MIN(to_date("original air date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS premiere_date,
       MAX(to_date("original air date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS finale_date,
       COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE season IN (2, 10)
GROUP BY season
ORDER BY season;
Results:
- Season 2: premiere_date = 1996-11-23; finale_date = 1996-11-23; episode_count = 1
- Season 10: premiere_date = 1997-01-11; finale_date = 1997-01-11; episode_count = 1

4) Day difference between premiere dates
SQL:
WITH premiere_dates AS (
  SELECT season,
         to_date("original air date", 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS premiere_date
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE season IN (2, 10)
)
SELECT (SELECT premiere_date FROM premiere_dates WHERE season = 2) AS premiere_date_s2,
       (SELECT premiere_date FROM premiere_dates WHERE season = 10) AS premiere_date_s10,
       (SELECT premiere_date FROM premiere_dates WHERE season = 10) - (SELECT premiere_date FROM premiere_dates WHERE season = 2) AS day_diff;
Results:
- premiere_date_s2 = 1996-11-23
- premiere_date_s10 = 1997-01-11
- day_diff = 49 days

Findings
- Only Season 10’s premiere date is in January (January 11, 1997). Season 2’s premiere date is in November (November 23, 1996).
- The two premiere dates are 49 days apart, not “almost exactly 1 year apart.”

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions
- “Air” refers to the season premiere (earliest original air date) within each season as recorded in public.list_of_all_that_episodes.
- The dataset is treated as authoritative as provided; for Seasons 2 and 10 it contains one episode each, which was used to determine premiere dates.
- Dates in "original air date" are in the format Month DD, YYYY and were parsed accordingly.
