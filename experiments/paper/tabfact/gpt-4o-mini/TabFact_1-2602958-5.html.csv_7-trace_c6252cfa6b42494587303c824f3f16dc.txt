Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes (columns include: no, title, director, writer (s), original air date, prod code, us viewers (million))

Evidence from the data
1) List all episodes directed by anyone with ‘Palladino’ in their name
SQL:
SELECT no, title, director FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE director ILIKE '%palladino%';
Result rows:
- no: 66 | title: Ballrooms and Biscotti | director: Amy Sherman - Palladino
- no: 83 | title: Tick, Tick, Tick, Boom! | director: Daniel Palladino

2) Breakdown by exact director values (to confirm counts)
SQL:
SELECT director, COUNT(*) AS director_count FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE director ILIKE '%palladino%' GROUP BY director;
Results:
- Amy Sherman - Palladino | 1
- Daniel Palladino | 1

3) Tokenized name matching for robustness (handles spacing and hyphen variants)
- Amy Sherman‑Palladino count
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_amys FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE LOWER(director) LIKE '%amy%' AND LOWER(director) LIKE '%sherman%' AND LOWER(director) LIKE '%palladino%';
Result: 1
- Daniel Palladino count
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_daniels FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE LOWER(director) LIKE '%daniel%' AND LOWER(director) LIKE '%palladino%';
