Claim to verify: “l 72 - 86 result have a seed less than 12 and a year that’s larger than 1996.”

Interpretation used: We interpret “l 72 - 86 result” as referring to rows where the results field records a game outcome of a loss with the score 72-86 (e.g., “L 72-86”, “l 72 - 86”). We check whether those row(s) have seed < 12 and year > 1996.

Data source discovery and structure
- Verified available tables and columns.
  - Executed SQL:
    1) List tables in public schema:
       SELECT table_name 
       FROM information_schema.tables 
       WHERE table_schema = 'public';
    2) List columns and types:
       SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
       FROM information_schema.columns 
       WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  - Result (summarized): Found table public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball with columns: year (bigint), seed (bigint), record (text), region (text), results (text).

Verification steps and evidence
1) Locate rows with a results value indicating a loss 72-86 and test the condition (seed < 12 AND year > 1996):
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT year, seed, record, region, results, (seed < 12 AND year > 1996) AS meets_condition
     FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
     WHERE results ILIKE 'L%72%-%86%';
   - Output (summarized):
     • Year: 1980; Seed: 12; Record: 18 - 12; Region: east; Results: l 72 - 86; Meets_Condition: false

2) Count how many such rows meet the condition vs. not:
   - Executed SQL:
     SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, (seed < 12 AND year > 1996) AS meets_condition
     FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
     WHERE results ILIKE 'L%72%-%86%'
     GROUP BY meets_condition;
   - Output (summarized):
     • meet_condition = true: 0 rows
     • meet_condition = false: 1 row

Conclusion
- We found one game with a results string indicating “L 72-86,” but it does not satisfy the stated condition (seed is 12, not less than 12; year is 1980, not greater than 1996). Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “l 72 - 86 result” refers to the textual results column value indicating a loss by the score 72–86 (allowing for spacing/case variations) and not to a row-number range or any other interpretation.
