Claim to verify: “the game with a score of 3 - 2 be hold in chongqing , england and the venue be london , china.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered data sources: PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table public.kwak_tae_hwi.
- Table schema (public.kwak_tae_hwi): columns = date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text).

Evidence
1) Identify games with a 3–2 score (normalize spaces/dashes)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, competition, venue, score 
FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi 
WHERE replace(replace(trim(score), ' ', ''), '-', '') = '32';
Result:
- Date: February 17, 2008; Competition: 2008 East Asian Cup; Venue: Chongqing, China; Score: 3 - 2

2) Check for exact venues claimed (“Chongqing, England” or “London, China”)
SQL executed:
SELECT date, competition, venue FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue = 'Chongqing, England' OR venue = 'London, China';
Result: No records found.

3) Show actual entries containing “Chongqing” or “London” for context
SQL executed:
SELECT date, competition, venue FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue ILIKE '%Chongqing%' OR venue ILIKE '%London%';
Results:
- February 17, 2008; 2008 East Asian Cup; Chongqing, China
- March 3, 2010; Friendly; London, England

Assessment
- A game with a 3–2 score exists in the dataset, and it was held in Chongqing, China (not Chongqing, England).
- No game has venue listed as “London, China”; London appears as “London, England.”
- Therefore, the claim that the 3–2 game was held in “Chongqing, England” and that the venue was “London, China” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “the game with a score of 3 - 2” as the match(es) in the dataset whose score normalizes to 3–2.
- Interpreted the phrasing to assert specific city–country pairs as recorded in the venue field of the dataset.
- Treated the provided database as the authoritative source for verification.
