Claim to verify: "tyler farrar do not win any stage"

Scope and data source
- Available authoritative data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a (stage-level results for the 2010 Vuelta a España).

Evidence
1) Query to find any stages with a winner named Farrar
Executed SQL:
SELECT stage, winner FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE winner ILIKE '%Farrar%';
Result:
- Stage 5 — winner: tyler farrar
- Stage 21 — winner: tyler farrar

2) Query to confirm full details for these stages
Executed SQL:
SELECT stage, winner, "general classification", "points classification", "mountains classification", "combination classification", "team classification" FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE stage IN (5, 21);
Result summary:
- Stage 5: Winner — Tyler Farrar; GC — Philippe Gilbert; Points — Igor Antón; Mountains — Serafín Martínez; Combination — Vincenzo Nibali; Team — Caisse d'Epargne
- Stage 21: Winner — Tyler Farrar; GC — Vincenzo Nibali; Points — Mark Cavendish; Mountains — David Moncoutié; Combination — Vincenzo Nibali; Team — Team Katusha

Conclusion
- The data clearly shows Tyler Farrar won stages 5 and 21 of the 2010 Vuelta a España. Therefore, the claim that he did not win any stage is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible dataset pertains to the 2010 Vuelta a España, the claim was interpreted in the context of this race. Within this scope, the claim is inaccurate.
