Claim to verify: “on march 10 , vince carter (43) have high point and alvin williams (9) have high assist.”

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table for the Toronto Raptors’ 2001–2002 season: public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season

Step 2 — Understand the schema
- Tool response describing columns of public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season:
  - game (bigint) — game identifier
  - date (text) — date of the game
  - team (text) — team name
  - score (text) — final score
  - high points (text) — player with most points (and value)
  - high rebounds (text) — player with most rebounds
  - high assists (text) — player with most assists
  - location attendance (text)
  - record (text)

Step 3 — Retrieve evidence
Executed SQL (as returned by the tool):
1) Query used to retrieve dates and leaders (points and assists):
SELECT date, "high points", "high assists" FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season;

Key returned rows relevant to March:
- march 5  | vince carter (43) | alvin williams (9)
- march 10 | vince carter (16) | chris childs (7)

Step 4 — Assessment against the claim
- The claim associates “March 10” with Vince Carter scoring 43 and Alvin Williams having 9 assists. However, the table shows that performance occurred on March 5, not March 10.
- On March 10, the team leaders were Vince Carter (16 points) and Chris Childs (7 assists).

Conclusion
- The specific pairing “Vince Carter (43) and Alvin Williams (9)” did happen, but on March 5. On March 10, those leaders and values do not match the claim. Therefore, the claim as stated (for March 10) is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “March 10” refers to March 10 of the 2001–2002 NBA season (i.e., March 2002) for the Toronto Raptors.
- “high point” and “high assist” are interpreted as the team-high values recorded in the table’s “high points” and “high assists” fields.
