Summary
- Claim interpreted: For the 2018 season, the Air Force–Navy score is still recorded as TBD (to be determined).
- Finding: Supported by the database record.

Data source discovery
- Identified a PostgreSQL data source with a table named commander_in_chief_s_trophy in the public schema.

Schema details (relevant table)
- Table: commander_in_chief_s_trophy
- Columns:
  - season (bigint, not null)
  - trophy winner (text, not null)
  - air force - navy score (text, not null)
  - air force - army score (text, not null)
  - army - navy score (text, not null)

Evidence and executed SQL
- Query executed:
  SELECT "air force - navy score" FROM commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 2018;
- Result:
  air force - navy score = "tbd"

Assessment
- The database explicitly records the 2018 Air Force–Navy score as "tbd". This matches the claim that the score is yet TBD.

Assumptions
- I interpreted the phrase "be yet tbd" to mean the score is recorded as TBD (to be determined) for that matchup in the dataset.
