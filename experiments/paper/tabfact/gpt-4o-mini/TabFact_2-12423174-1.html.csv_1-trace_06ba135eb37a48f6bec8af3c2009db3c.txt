Summary of data sources examined
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database containing a single relevant table: t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs (public schema), pertaining to the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs.

Schema details (how performance is recorded)
- Table: t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)
- Interpretation: Team performance is represented by first-leg and second-leg match results and their aggregate (“agg”). There is no column for standings or “points,” which indicates a knockout tie format rather than a points-based group format.

Evidence from executed queries
1) Query to find Young Africans entries
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Young Africans%' 
   OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Young Africans%';

Result:
- Team 1: Young Africans
- Team 2: Lavori Publici
- 1st Leg: 2 - 0
- 2nd Leg: 0 - 0
- Aggregate: 2 - 0

2) Query to capture naming variants (singular form)
SQL executed:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
FROM t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Young African%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Young African%';

Result (same tie):
- Team 1: young africans
- Team 2: lavori publici
- 1st Leg: 2 - 0
- 2nd Leg: 0 - 0
- Aggregate: 2 - 0

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “the young african score 2 point in the 1971 african cup of champion club.”
- What the data shows:
  - The competition data is organized as home-and-away knockout ties with aggregate scores; there is no representation of “points.”
  - Young Africans played a tie versus Lavori Publici with results 2-0 (first leg) and 0-0 (second leg), for an aggregate of 2-0. This demonstrates Young Africans scored 2 goals across the tie.
- Conclusion:
  - If “points” is taken literally (standings points), the claim is not supported because the 1971 competition in this dataset is not points-based and no “points” are recorded.
  - If “points” was intended to mean “goals,” the number 2 aligns with the aggregate goals scored by Young Africans in the documented tie.

Final conclusion
- The database provides evidence that Young Africans scored 2 goals in their 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs tie, but it does not support a statement about “2 points,” as points are not used or recorded in this dataset for that competition.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “the young african” as the club Young Africans (Tanzania), based on name matching in the dataset.
- Considered the possibility that “point” was a colloquialism for “goal,” but evaluated the literal “points” interpretation against the available data (which contains no points metric).
