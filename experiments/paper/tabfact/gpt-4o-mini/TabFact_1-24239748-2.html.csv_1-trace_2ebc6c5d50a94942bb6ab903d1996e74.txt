Claim interpreted: “Vest county make 6.270.2 in export” ≈ The entry labeled “Vest” has exports of 6,270.2 (US$ million).

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema
- Table: list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade (county [text], exports (us mil) [text], percent of total exports [text], imports (us mil) [text], percent of total imports [text])

Evidence gathered:
1) Locate entries whose name contains “vest” and read their export values
Executed SQL:
SELECT county, "exports (us mil)" 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE county ILIKE 'vest%' OR county ILIKE '%vest%';
Result:
- county: vest | exports (us mil): 6270.2
- county: nord - vest | exports (us mil): 4726.6
- county: sud - vest oltenia | exports (us mil): 3226.2

2) Confirm the “vest” export value numerically (strip any thousands separators and cast)
Executed SQL:
SELECT county, REPLACE("exports (us mil)", ',', '')::numeric AS exports_us_mil_numeric 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE county ILIKE 'vest%';
Result:
- county: vest | exports_us_mil_numeric: 6270.2

Conclusion:
- The table records an entry named “vest” with exports equal to 6270.2 (US$ million). This matches the claimed figure “6.270.2” once normalized to standard decimal formatting (6,270.2).

Assumptions made:
- “Vest county” refers to the “vest” entry in the provided dataset (noting that, in Romania, “Vest” is a development region label rather than a county name, but we rely strictly on the dataset’s labels).
- “6.270.2” denotes 6,270.2 million USD in exports.
