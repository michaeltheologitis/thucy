Claim assessed: “the highest number of tie in a season by the hurricane be in 2003.”

Data source discovery
- Discovered database: public schema with table: dundee_hurricanes.
- Table columns: season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), final position (text), notes (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Determine the maximum number of ties and the season(s) with that value
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(ties) AS max_ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes;
- Result: max_ties = 3

- SQL:
  SELECT season FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE ties = (SELECT MAX(ties) FROM public.dundee_hurricanes);
- Result: season = 2008

2) Check the 2003 season record
- SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.dundee_hurricanes WHERE season = 2003;
- Result: division = bafl division 2 north; wins = 6; losses = 4; ties = 0; final position = 4 / 11; notes = -

3) Full ties-by-season context
- SQL:
  SELECT season, ties FROM public.dundee_hurricanes ORDER BY ties DESC, season ASC;
- Result (top to bottom):
  - 2008 — ties: 3
  - 2004 — ties: 1
  - 2009 — ties: 1
  - 2003 — ties: 0
  - 2005 — ties: 0
  - 2006 — ties: 0
  - 2007 — ties: 0

Conclusion
- The highest number of ties in a season is 3, occurring in 2008. In 2003, the team recorded 0 ties. Therefore, the claim that the highest number of ties was in 2003 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes team represented by the public.dundee_hurricanes table.
- “tie” corresponds to the ties column.
- “season” corresponds to the season column (year).
