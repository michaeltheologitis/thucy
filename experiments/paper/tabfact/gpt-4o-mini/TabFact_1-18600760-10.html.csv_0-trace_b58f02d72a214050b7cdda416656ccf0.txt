Summary of verification
- Claim: "joliette have 0.771 square mile of water , and can be find with geo id 3806741020"
- Data source: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota (authoritative table of North Dakota townships, including township name, county, water area in square miles, and GEOID)

Evidence from data
- Retrieved record shows:
  - Township: Joliette
  - County: Pembina
  - Water (sqmi): 0.771
  - Geo ID: 3806741020

Exact SQL executed (evidence)
SELECT township, county, "water (sqmi)", "pop (2010)", "geo id"
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
WHERE township ILIKE '%Joliette%';

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly reports Joliette with water area = 0.771 square miles and GEOID = 3806741020. This directly supports both parts of the claim.

Assumptions
- "joliette" refers to Joliette Township (a county subdivision) in Pembina County, North Dakota, consistent with the GEOID pattern for county subdivisions (state 38 = ND, county 067 = Pembina).
