Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table public.chinese_units_of_measurement containing traditional Chinese units and their metric values.

Evidence retrieved
- Query objective: Fetch entries for the units 錢, 兩, and 斤, showing their character, relative value, and metric value.

Executed SQL
SELECT character, "relative value", "metric value" 
FROM public.chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE character IN ('錢', '兩', '斤');

Query results
- 錢: relative value = 1 / 160; metric value = 3.779936375 g
- 兩: relative value = 1 / 16; metric value = 37.79936375 g
- 斤: relative value = 1; metric value = 604.78982 g

Assessment
- The database explicitly provides metric values for 錢, 兩, and 斤, each expressed in grams (g). This supports the claim that these units have metric values measured in grams.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as: “These traditional units (錢, 兩, 斤) have defined metric equivalents expressed in grams,” using the authoritative definitions contained in the available database.
