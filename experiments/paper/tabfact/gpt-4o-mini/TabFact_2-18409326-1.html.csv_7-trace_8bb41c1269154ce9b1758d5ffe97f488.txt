What I checked
- Explored the available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database with a public.media_in_kelowna table describing media outlets in Kelowna, including format and owner.

Evidence from the data
- Query to find radio entries with format matching “Adult Hits” (or similar variations), returning call sign, branding, frequency, and owner:

Executed SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "branding", "frequency", "owner" 
FROM public.media_in_kelowna 
WHERE "format" ILIKE '%Adult Hits%' OR "format" ILIKE '%adult hit%' OR "format" ILIKE '%adult hits%';

Result excerpt:
- Call Sign: cjui - fm
- Branding: 103.9 the juice
- Frequency: 0 103.9 fm
- Owner: Vista Broadcast Group

Conclusion
- The radio station in the dataset with an Adult Hits format (CJUI-FM, “103.9 The Juice”) lists its owner as Vista Broadcast Group. This supports the claim that the owner of the radio station that plays Adult Hits is Vista Broadcast Group.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Adult Hits radio station represented in the provided Kelowna media dataset.
- Treated format text matching (“Adult Hits” and close variants) as sufficient to identify the relevant station.
