Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes (episodes of “Republic of Doyle”).

Schema overview (from schema inspection)
- Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "viewers" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "prod code" (bigint).
- Note: original airdate is stored as text in a format like “january 6 , 2010”, with a space before the comma.

Step 1: Inspect date format (evidence)
Executed SQL:
SELECT title, "original airdate" FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes LIMIT 20;
Key returned rows (excerpt) showed:
- january 6 , 2010
- january 13 , 2010
- january 20 , 2010
- february 3 , 2010
- february 10 , 2010
- march entries thereafter

Step 2: Parse air dates and count January vs February episodes by year (evidence)
Executed SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) AS year, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS jan_count, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS feb_count 
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes 
WHERE TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY') IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY year 
HAVING SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) = 1 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 
   OR SUM(CASE WHEN EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(REGEXP_REPLACE("original airdate", '\s*,', ',', 'g'), 'FMMonth FMDD, YYYY')) = 2 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) > 0 
ORDER BY year;

Result summarized by the tool:
- 2010: January episodes = 3, February episodes = 2.

Assessment
- In the available dataset, the only year with January/February airings is 2010, where January has 3 episodes and February has 2. This contradicts the claim that there are 3 episodes in February and only 2 in January.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data available: January has more episodes (3) than February (2), not the other way around.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement as referring to the episodes present in the accessible “Republic of Doyle” dataset (which, per the evidence returned, includes 2010 January–March airings). No specific year was provided, so counts were based on the dataset’s actual entries, which show January = 3 and February = 2.
