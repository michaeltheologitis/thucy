Claim interpreted: “When the opponent is Pride, it is an away game at Villanova Stadium.” We verify against the available 2005 Philadelphia Barrage season data.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL, public schema
- Table: t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season (columns: date [text], opponent [text], "home / away" [text], field [text], result [text])

Step 1: Inspect rows where opponent is exactly 'Pride'
Result: 0 rows found (suggests the opponent may be recorded with variations; proceed with a contains search).
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, "home / away", field 
FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season 
WHERE opponent = 'Pride';

Step 2: Find all rows where opponent name contains 'Pride' (case-insensitive)
Result rows:
- Date: June 18 | Opponent: Pride | Home / Away: Away | Field: Alumni Stadium (Kean University) | Result: W 11 - 10
- Date: August 11 | Opponent: Pride | Home / Away: Home | Field: Villanova Stadium | Result: L 12 - 16
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, "home / away", field, result
FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%pride%';
Additional summary SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS count,
       COUNT(DISTINCT "home / away") AS distinct_home_away,
       COUNT(DISTINCT field) AS distinct_fields
FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%pride%';

Step 3: Distinct home/away and field combinations for 'Pride'
Result:
- Home, Villanova Stadium: 1 row
- Away, Alumni Stadium (Kean University): 1 row
SQL executed:
SELECT "home / away", field, COUNT(*) as row_count 
FROM public.t_2005_philadelphia_barrage_season 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%pride%' 
GROUP BY "home / away", field;

Assessment
- The data shows one away game vs Pride at Alumni Stadium (Kean University) and one home game vs Pride at Villanova Stadium.
- Therefore, it is not true that when the opponent is Pride, it is an away game at Villanova Stadium. In fact, the Villanova Stadium game was a home game, not away.

Assumptions
- “Opponent be pride” interpreted as any record where opponent contains the word “Pride.”
- “Away game at Villanova Stadium” assessed using the "home / away" and field columns in the table.
