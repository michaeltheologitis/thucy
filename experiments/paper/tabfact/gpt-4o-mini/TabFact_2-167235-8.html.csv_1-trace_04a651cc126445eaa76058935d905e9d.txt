- Result (excerpt with relevant entries):
  - Bashkim Fino
  - Ilir Meta
  - Pandeli Majko (1st time)
  - Ylli Bufi

Step 2 — Retrieve political party for the specified individuals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE lower(name) IN (lower('Ilir Meta'), lower('Bashkim Fino'), lower('Ylli Bufi'), lower('Pandeli Majko (1st time)'));
- Result:
  - Ilir Meta — Socialist Party of Albania
