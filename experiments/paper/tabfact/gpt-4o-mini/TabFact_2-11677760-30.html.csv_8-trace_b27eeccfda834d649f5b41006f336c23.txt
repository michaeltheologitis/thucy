Claim to verify: “The hometown of Cody Zeller is Wichita, KS.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema with table usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team, which includes columns: player (text), height (text), school (text), hometown (text), college (text).

Evidence from the data:
1) Identify Zeller entries and retrieve hometowns
SQL executed:
SELECT player, hometown, school, college FROM usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE player ILIKE '%Zeller%';
Result:
- Player: Cody Zeller | Hometown: Washington, IN | School: Washington High School | College: Indiana

2) Check whether any entry lists Wichita, KS and for whom
SQL executed:
SELECT player, hometown FROM usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team WHERE hometown ILIKE '%Wichita%' OR hometown ILIKE '%KS';
Result:
- Player: Perry Ellis | Hometown: Wichita, KS

Assessment:
- The table explicitly lists Cody Zeller’s hometown as Washington, IN. Wichita, KS appears in the dataset for Perry Ellis, not Cody Zeller. Therefore, the claim that Cody Zeller’s hometown is Wichita, KS is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions:
- “Hometown” in the usa_today_all_usa_high_school_basketball_team table reflects the player’s listed hometown in this authoritative dataset.
- “Cody Zeller” refers to the high school basketball player later known as the NBA player of the same name.
