Claim: "the cleveland brown have tie a total of 10 game"

Step 1: Explore available data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table in the public schema: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.

Step 2: Inspect schema to understand available fields
- Table: list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
  - Columns:
    - quarterback (text)
    - uniform no (s) (text)
    - games started (bigint)
    - wins (bigint)
    - losses (bigint)
    - ties (bigint)
    - winning pct (double precision)

Step 3: Gather evidence from the data
- Question: What is the total number of ties recorded across all Browns starting quarterbacks? Also, validate the totals by summing wins, losses, and ties against games started.

Executed SQL and results:
1) SQL:
SELECT SUM(ties) AS total_ties FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;
Result: total_ties = 10

2) SQL:
SELECT SUM("games started") AS total_games_started, SUM(wins) AS total_wins, SUM(losses) AS total_losses, SUM(ties) AS total_ties FROM list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;
Results:
- total_games_started = 883
- total_wins = 451
- total_losses = 422
- total_ties = 10

Validation:
- Wins + Losses + Ties = 451 + 422 + 10 = 883, which matches total_games_started, indicating internal consistency of the dataset.

Conclusion:
- The data shows the Cleveland Browns have 10 ties in the aggregated results across all starting quarterbacks. This supports the claim that they have tied a total of 10 games.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the franchise’s total number of ties across all games represented in the dataset (which appears to be regular-season starts). Since only one starting quarterback exists per game, summing ties by starting quarterback equates to the team’s total ties in those games.
