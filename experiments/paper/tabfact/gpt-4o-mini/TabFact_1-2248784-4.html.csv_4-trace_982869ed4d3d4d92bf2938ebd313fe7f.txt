Claim to verify: "iran's 2011 gdp be 261.189"

Data source discovery:
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
- Column of interest: "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision), which represents 2011 GDP in PPP terms, billions of USD.

Evidence:
1) Query to retrieve Iran’s 2011 GDP (PPP):
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp WHERE country = 'Iran' OR country = 'IRAN' OR country = 'iran';

Result:
- Iran — 930.236 (billions of USD, PPP)

2) Query to confirm no alternate country name variants (e.g., different spellings) affect the result:
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" 
FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp 
WHERE country ILIKE '%iran%';

Result:
- Iran — 930.236 (billions of USD, PPP)

Assessment:
- The database reports Iran’s 2011 GDP (PPP) as 930.236 billion USD. This does not match the claimed value of 261.189.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and scope:
- The claim did not specify whether GDP referred to nominal or PPP. The only available authoritative data source contains PPP values for 2011 in billions of USD; therefore, verification was performed against GDP (PPP).
