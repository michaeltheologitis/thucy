Data source exploration
- Available tables
  - Evidence SQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  - Result: east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 (only table found)

- Table schema for public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99
  - Evidence SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99';
  - Result columns: date (text), opponent (text), site (text), result (text), attendance (text)
  - Evidence SQL: SELECT kcu.column_name, tc.constraint_type FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu ON tc.constraint_name = kcu.constraint_name WHERE tc.table_name = 'east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99';
  - Result: No keys/constraints found

Verification queries and results
1) Find all games vs UAB (including alias Alabama-Birmingham)
- Evidence SQL: SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE opponent ILIKE 'UAB' OR opponent ILIKE 'Alabama-Birmingham';
- Result:
  - Date: October 10
  - Opponent: UAB
  - Site: Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium, Greenville, NC
  - Result: W 26 - 7
  - Attendance: 31,002

2) Independently verify attendance value equals 31,002
- Evidence SQL: SELECT date, opponent, site, result, attendance FROM public.east_carolina_pirates_football_1990_99 WHERE REPLACE(attendance, ',', '')::integer = 31002;
- Result (matches the above row):
  - Date: October 10
  - Opponent: UAB
  - Site: Dowdy - Ficklen Stadium, Greenville, NC
  - Result: W 26 - 7
  - Attendance: 31,002

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that when East Carolina played UAB (home game at Dowdy-Ficklen Stadium), the recorded attendance was 31,002. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (East Carolina Pirates football, 1990s). The year is not specified in the table (date column holds month/day text), but the opponent and attendance match precisely.
