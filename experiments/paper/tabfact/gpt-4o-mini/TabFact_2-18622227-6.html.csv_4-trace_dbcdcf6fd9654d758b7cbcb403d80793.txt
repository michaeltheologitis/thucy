Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that, in the available dataset for Katrina Adams’ Grand Slam results, the Australian Open row contains three occurrences of the result code “a” and the Wimbledon row contains one occurrence of “a”.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.katrina_adams (single table available)

Schema overview (from schema query)
- Table: katrina_adams
  - Columns: tournament (text), 1986 (text), 1988 (text), 1989 (text), 1990 (text), 1991 (text), 1992 (text), 1993 (text), 1994 (text), 1995 (text), 1996 (text), 1997 (text), 1998 (text), 1999 (text)
  - tournament holds tournament names; year columns hold result codes (e.g., a, 1r, 2r, 3r, qf, sf, etc.)

Evidence 1: Tournaments present
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM katrina_adams;
- Result:
  1) US Open
  2) Wimbledon
  3) French Open
  4) Grand Slam Tournaments
  5) Australian Open

Evidence 2: Year-by-year results for Australian Open and Wimbledon
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM katrina_adams WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Australian%' OR tournament ILIKE '%Wimbledon%';
- Returned rows (as provided by the query tool):
  • Australian Open: 1986: a, 1988: 3r, 1989: 3r, 1990: 3r, 1991: a, 1992: qf, 1993: 3r, 1994: 2r, 1995: 1r, 1996: a, 1997: 2r, 1998: 1r, 1999: 1r
  • Wimbledon: 1986: a, 1988: sf, 1989: qf, 1990: 3r, 1991: qf, 1992: 3r, 1993: 1r, 1994: 2r, 1995: 3r, 1996: qf, 1997: 3r, 1998: 3r, 1999: 1r

Derived counts of 'a'
- Australian Open: occurrences of 'a' in 1986, 1991, 1996 → total = 3
- Wimbledon: occurrence of 'a' in 1986 → total = 1

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that Australian Open has three 'a' results and Wimbledon has one 'a' result for Katrina Adams across the listed years. This supports the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- “a result” refers to the result code “a” in the table (commonly denotes absence/withdrawal) and not to other meanings.
- The claim concerns the katrina_adams table available in the current data environment, and lower-case codes (e.g., 'a') are used as returned by the query tool.
