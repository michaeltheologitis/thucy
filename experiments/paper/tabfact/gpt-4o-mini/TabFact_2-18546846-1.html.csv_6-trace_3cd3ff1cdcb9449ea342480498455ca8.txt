Summary
- Interpretation: I interpret the claim as referring to the San Francisco 49ers’ last opponent in the 1947 season (the only season available in the connected data).

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season (columns: week BIGINT, date TEXT, opponent TEXT, result TEXT, score TEXT, record TEXT)

Evidence 1: Identify the last opponent of the 1947 season
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = (SELECT MAX(week) FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season)
- Result:
  - Week: 14
  - Date: December 7, 1947
  - Opponent: Buffalo Bills
  - Result: t
  - Score: 21 - 21
  - Record: 8 - 4 - 2

Evidence 2: Check if the 49ers played the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score, record 
FROM t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season 
WHERE opponent LIKE '%Dodgers%';
- Result: No rows returned (no recorded games vs. a team named “Dodgers” in the 1947 dataset).

Conclusion
- The data shows the 49ers’ last opponent in 1947 was the Buffalo Bills, not the Brooklyn Dodgers. Additionally, there are no games in 1947 against a team named “Dodgers.” Within the scope of available data, the claim is not supported.

Assumptions
- “49ers” refers to the San Francisco 49ers.
- “Last opponent of the season” refers to the final game of the 1947 season, which is the only season available in the connected data.
