Summary conclusion: The data shows 5 years in the table, and the sum of the agriculture values across all those 5 years is 54. This verifies the claim.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Table: my_info_table (columns: year, "regional gva", agriculture, industry, services)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List of years and agriculture values
- Executed SQL: SELECT year, agriculture FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result rows:
  - Year: 1995, Agriculture: 11
  - Year: 2000, Agriculture: 10
  - Year: 2003, Agriculture: 11
  - Year: 2005, Agriculture: 11
  - Year: 2007, Agriculture: 11

2) Count of rows and distinct years
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: total_rows = 5
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT year) AS distinct_years FROM public.my_info_table;
- Result: distinct_years = 5

3) Sum of agriculture across all rows
- Executed SQL: SELECT SUM(agriculture) AS total_agriculture_sum FROM my_info_table;
- Result: total_agriculture_sum = 54

Interpretation
- There are exactly 5 years in the dataset.
- Summing agriculture values for these 5 years (11 + 10 + 11 + 11 + 11) equals 54, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- "all 5 year list" refers to all rows/years present in public.my_info_table with no additional filters or exclusions.
