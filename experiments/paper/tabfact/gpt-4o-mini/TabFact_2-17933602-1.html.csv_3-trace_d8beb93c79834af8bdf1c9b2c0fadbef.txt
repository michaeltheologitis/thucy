Claim: “Porto be 1st in the liga for the 2003 - 2004 season, follow by Benfica.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a relevant table: public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga. A schema check indicates this table includes a column named "2003 - 2004 season" containing position strings for that season.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Identify clubs explicitly marked as top-division (“in the liga”) in 2003–2004:
SQL:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season" AS position FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" LIKE '%in the liga%';
Result highlights:
- Porto — 1st in the liga
- Benfica — 2nd in the liga
(Other rows returned include: Sporting CP — 3rd in the liga; Nacional — 4th; Braga — 5th; etc.)

2) Cross-check for entries containing ‘1st’ or ‘2nd’ (captures both top-division and second-tier labels):
SQL:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season" 
FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga 
WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" ILIKE '%1st%' OR "2003 - 2004 season" ILIKE '%2nd%';
Result highlights:
- Porto — 1st in the liga
- Benfica — 2nd in the liga
(Note: This query also returns second-tier entries like Estoril - Praia — 1st in the liga de honra and Vitória de Setúbal — 2nd in the liga de honra, which are not relevant to the top division claim.)

Conclusion
- The data shows Porto finished 1st and Benfica finished 2nd in the top division (“the liga”) for the 2003–2004 season. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “liga” refers to the Portuguese top-flight Primeira Liga, not the second division (Liga de Honra).
