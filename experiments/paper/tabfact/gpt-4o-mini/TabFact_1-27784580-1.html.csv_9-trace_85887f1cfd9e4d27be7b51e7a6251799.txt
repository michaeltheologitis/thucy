Summary of verification
- Claim: “suki to ietara iinoni have 5.8% higher rating than the title with the lowest rating.”
- Finding: The episode “suki to ietara iinoni” is rated 17.4%. The lowest-rated title is 13.4%. The absolute difference is 4.0 percentage points (not 5.8). The relative difference is about 29.85% (also not 5.8%).

Data sources explored
- Discovered a single PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table: tsuki_no_koibito (episode titles and ratings).
- Relevant columns: "episode title", "romanized title", "ratings" (text), etc.

Evidence and executed SQL
Executed SQL:
SELECT "Unnamed: 0", "episode title", "romanized title", "ratings", REPLACE("ratings", '%', '')::numeric AS numeric_rating
FROM tsuki_no_koibito;

Result excerpts (romanized title → ratings → numeric rating):
- omae ga hosii → 22.4% → 22.4
- arienai kisu → 19.2% → 19.2
- fukusyū no puropōzu → 15.6% → 15.6
- konna ni suki dattanda… → 15.5% → 15.5
- suki to ietara iinoni → 17.4% → 17.4
- saishūshōjomakuwakare → 13.4% → 13.4

Analysis
- Lowest rating in the dataset: 13.4% (saishūshōjomakuwakare).
- Rating for “suki to ietara iinoni”: 17.4%.
- Absolute difference: 17.4 − 13.4 = 4.0 percentage points.
- Relative difference: (17.4 − 13.4) / 13.4 ≈ 0.2985 → 29.85%.
- Neither interpretation (percentage-point or relative) equals 5.8%.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data. “suki to ietara iinoni” is 4.0 percentage points (≈29.85% relatively) higher than the lowest-rated title, not 5.8% higher.

Assumptions
- “suki to ietara iinoni” refers to the romanized title field in the tsuki_no_koibito table.
- “5.8% higher” was interpreted as either an absolute percentage-point difference or a relative percentage difference; both were checked against the dataset.
