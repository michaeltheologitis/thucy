Claim interpreted: “All 3 of the complete projects were completed between 1993 and 1997.” Interpreting “complete projects” as sites with an actual Construction Completed date in the dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL public schema with table list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi (trusted as authoritative per instructions).
- Relevant columns: name (text), construction completed (text), deleted (text), among others.

Step 1: Identify sites with actual construction completion dates and extract years
Executed SQL:
SELECT name,
       "construction completed" AS completed_raw,
       split_part(regexp_replace("construction completed", '\\s', '', 'g'), '/', 3) AS year
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE "construction completed" ~ '[0-9]{4}';

Results:
- Flowood Site | 09 / 17 / 1993 | Year: 1993
- Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc | 08 / 08 / 1997 | Year: 1997
- Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982 | Year: 1982

Step 2: Count of completion dates within 1993–1997 (inclusive)
Executed SQL:
WITH completions AS (
  SELECT name,
         split_part(regexp_replace("construction completed", '\\s', '', 'g'), '/', 3) AS year
  FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
  WHERE "construction completed" ~ '[0-9]{4}'
)
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) AS total_with_completion_dates,
  SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(year AS INT) BETWEEN 1993 AND 1997 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS count_between_1993_1997,
  SUM(CASE WHEN CAST(year AS INT) BETWEEN 1993 AND 1997 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END) AS count_outside_1993_1997
FROM completions;

Results summary:
- Total sites with construction completion dates: 3
- Completed between 1993–1997: 2
- Completed outside 1993–1997: 1 (1982)

Step 3 (cross-check alternative interpretation): If “complete” means “Deleted from NPL”
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "deleted" AS deleted_raw,
       CASE WHEN "deleted" ~ '[0-9]{4}' THEN split_part(regexp_replace("deleted", '\\s', '', 'g'), '/', 3) ELSE NULL END AS deleted_year
FROM public.list_of_superfund_sites_in_mississippi
WHERE "deleted" IS NOT NULL AND "deleted" <> '';

Key results:
- Flowood Site | 02 / 16 / 1996 | Year: 1996
- Newsom Brothers / Old Reichhold Chemicals, Inc | 09 / 27 / 2000 | Year: 2000
- Walcotte Chemical Co Warehouses | 12 / 30 / 1982 | Year: 1982
Interpretation: Only one deletion date (1996) falls within 1993–1997; the other two are 1982 and 2000. This also contradicts the claim if “complete” were taken to mean “deleted.”

Conclusion
- There are exactly three sites with actual Construction Completed dates, but only two (1993 and 1997) fall within 1993–1997. One was completed in 1982. Therefore, the statement that all three were completed between 1993 and 1997 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Complete project” is interpreted primarily as having a concrete Construction Completed date, with the range treated as inclusive (1993–1997). “-” values are treated as not completed/unknown. A secondary check using Deleted dates was also performed to cover a plausible alternate meaning; it likewise contradicts the claim.
