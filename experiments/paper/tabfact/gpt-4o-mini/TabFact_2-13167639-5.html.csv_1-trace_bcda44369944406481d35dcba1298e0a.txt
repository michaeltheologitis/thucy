Claim assessed: “the final result on December 17, 2002 be 1 - 0.”

Summary of findings
- In the available authoritative dataset (Manchester United F.C. 2002–03 season), there is a match on 17 December 2002. The recorded score is 1 - 0 against Chelsea (Round 5). This supports the claim if “final result” is interpreted as “final score of the match on that date.”

Supporting evidence (with executed SQL)
1) Quick sample to understand table contents and date format:
SQL:
SELECT date, round, opponents, "result f - a"
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season
LIMIT 20;
Evidence observed among returned rows:
- 17 December 2002 | Round 5 | Chelsea | 1 - 0

2) Targeted retrieval for the date using case-insensitive pattern match (date stored as text):
SQL:
SELECT date, round, opponents, "result f - a" FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE LOWER('%17 December 2002%');
Result:
- Date: 17 December 2002
- Round: Round 5
- Opponents: Chelsea
- Result (f - a): 1 - 0

Conclusion
- The dataset records the match on 17 December 2002 as a 1 - 0 result, confirming the claim when interpreted as the final match score.

Assumptions
- “Final result” is interpreted as the final score of Manchester United’s match on that date, since the only accessible data source pertains to Manchester United’s 2002–03 season. The match on that date was Round 5 (not a tournament final).
