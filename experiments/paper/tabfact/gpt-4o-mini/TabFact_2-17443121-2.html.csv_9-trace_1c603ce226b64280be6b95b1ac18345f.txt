Claim to verify: “no episode of gary unmarried air in december 2009.”

Data source discovery and schema
- Discovered database: TabFact (PostgreSQL), schema: public
- Relevant table: public.gary_unmarried
  - Columns: episode (text), "air date" (text), timeslot (text), "18 - 49" (text), viewers (double precision)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to understand air date format
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.gary_unmarried LIMIT 20;
Evidence summary:
- The air date values are stored as lowercase text like "december 10 , 2008", "january 14 , 2009", etc. The sample included entries up to May 2009 and showed no formatting as actual date types.

Step 2: Directly search for any December 2009 air dates
Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE LOWER("air date") LIKE '%december%2009%';
Result:
- 0 rows returned (no matches containing “december” and “2009”).

Step 3: List all 2009-dated entries to see which months exist
Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried WHERE "air date" ILIKE '%2009%' ORDER BY "air date";
Result summary:
- Returned 2009 episodes with air dates in January, February, March, April, and May 2009.
- No entries from December 2009 appear in this list.

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative dataset at hand, there are no episodes of Gary Unmarried with an air date in December 2009. All 2009 entries present are from January through May 2009, and a targeted search for “December 2009” returns no records. Therefore, the claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- I assume the public.gary_unmarried table is complete for the scope of episodes it is intended to cover. If the table omits later seasons or episodes, that limitation could affect conclusions about months not represented in the dataset.
