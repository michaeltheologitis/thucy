Summary conclusion
- Based on the authoritative data available, CKFR is listed with owner "astral media", not Bell Media. Rows where the owner is Bell Media show different call signs (CHSU-FM and CILK-FM). Therefore, the claim that the radio owned by Bell Media has the call sign CKFR is not supported by the data.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check all rows with owner matching Bell Media
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, format FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE owner ILIKE '%Bell Media%';

- Call Sign: CILK - FM | Frequency: 101.5 FM | Branding: 101.5 EZ Rock | Format: Adult Contemporary

2) Retrieve the CKFR record to confirm its owner
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, "format", owner 
FROM public.media_in_kelowna 
WHERE LOWER("call sign") = LOWER('ckfr');

3) Full table listing (for context)
SQL executed:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, format, owner FROM public.media_in_kelowna;
