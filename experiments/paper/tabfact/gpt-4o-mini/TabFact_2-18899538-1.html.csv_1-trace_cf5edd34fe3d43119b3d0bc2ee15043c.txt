Interpretation of the claim
- Interpreted as: The UPnP AV media server named “coherence” has partial support for Windows.

Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers (columns: name, license, os x, unix - like, windows, web interface)

Evidence
1) Retrieve names with Windows support status
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, windows FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers;
- Relevant returned row shows: name = coherence, windows = partial

2) Retrieve the full row for “coherence” (to confirm all fields and remove ambiguity)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('coherence');
- Returned values:
  - Name: coherence
  - License: mit
  - OS X: partial
  - Unix-like: partial
  - Windows: partial
  - Web Interface: yes

Assessment
- The row for “coherence” clearly lists Windows = partial. This matches the claim that coherence has partial Windows support.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data in the comparison_of_upnp_av_media_servers table.

Assumptions
- “coherence” refers to the UPnP AV media server entry in the table (case-insensitive match).
- “partial window” is interpreted as “partial Windows OS support,” corresponding to the “windows” column in the table.
