Claim to verify: “the average of all the home team score be less than 12.”

Summary conclusion: The average home team score in the available dataset is not less than 12. Using the 1972 VFL season data table (t_1972_vfl_season), the average home team goals is 15.33 (over 6 matches), and the average home team total points is 103.33—both clearly above 12.

Data source discovery
- Discovered data sources: A PostgreSQL database with a table t_1972_vfl_season in the public schema.
  Tool: discover_data_sources

Schema inspection
- Table: t_1972_vfl_season
  Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)
  Tool: schema_query

Evidence 1: Sample rows to understand score format
- Purpose: Verify how “home team score” is stored (e.g., goals.behinds (total points)).
- Result: Values like 14.7 (91), 16.14 (110), etc.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", date
  FROM t_1972_vfl_season
  LIMIT 10;

Evidence 2: Average home team goals
- Interpretation: Goals = integer before the dot (e.g., 14.7 (91) -> 14)
- Result: average_goals = 15.33, match_count = 6
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS average_goals, COUNT(*) AS match_count 
  FROM t_1972_vfl_season;

Evidence 3: Average home team total points and goals (for completeness)
- Interpretation: Total points = integer inside parentheses (e.g., 14.7 (91) -> 91)
- Result: avg_home_points = 103.33, avg_home_goals = 15.33, match_count = 6
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count,
      AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\((\d+)\)') AS INTEGER)) AS avg_home_points,
      AVG(CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '(\d+)\.') AS INTEGER)) AS avg_home_goals
  FROM t_1972_vfl_season;

Conclusion
- Whether interpreted as goals or total points, the average home team score is greater than 12. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data in the available dataset.

Assumptions
- “Home team score” refers to either the goals component (number before the dot) or the total points (number in parentheses) of the VFL match scores stored in t_1972_vfl_season.
- All rows in t_1972_vfl_season are included in “all the home team score.”
