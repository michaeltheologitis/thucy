Interpretation of the claim: I interpret “13 be the only season list” to mean “Season 13 is the only season listed in the available dataset.”

Data source exploration:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with a single table public.made_tv_series (fields include: season, episode, episode summary, premier date, external link, coach).

Evidence from the data:
1) Distinct seasons present
- Result: Only season 13 appears.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.made_tv_series ORDER BY season;

2) Episode count per season
- Result: Season 13 has 15 episodes.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, COUNT(episode) AS episode_count FROM public.made_tv_series GROUP BY season ORDER BY season;

3) Total number of distinct seasons
- Result: 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT season) AS total_distinct_seasons FROM public.made_tv_series;

Conclusion: The dataset lists only one season, and it is Season 13 (with 15 episodes). This supports the claim that 13 is the only season listed.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the seasons recorded in the provided public.made_tv_series table. No external sources beyond this dataset are implied.
