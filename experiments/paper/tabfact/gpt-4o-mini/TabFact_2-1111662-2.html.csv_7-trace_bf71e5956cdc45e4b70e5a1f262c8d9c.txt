Assessment

- Both Whitbread and Hattestad appear in the javelin throw entry, not discus throw.
Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the phrase “be in the discus throw event” as asserting association/record participation for the discus throw in the Memorial Van Damme dataset.
