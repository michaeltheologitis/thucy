Summary of data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa.

Relevant schema details (from schema inspection):
- Table: list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa
  - Columns: name (text), city (text), years as tallest (text), metres (double precision, meters), feet (bigint, feet), floors (bigint)

Evidence gathered:
1) Minimum height in feet
- Result: 196 feet
- Executed SQL Query:
  SELECT MIN(feet) AS min_feet FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa;

2) Count of buildings with height less than 196 feet
- Result: 0
- Executed SQL Query:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE feet < 196;

3) Any buildings with height less than 196 feet (name, city, feet)
- Result: No rows returned
- Executed SQL Query:
  SELECT name, city, feet FROM list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa WHERE feet < 196;

Conclusion:
- The data shows the minimum height recorded is exactly 196 feet, and there are zero buildings with feet < 196 in the available dataset. Therefore, within this dataset, the claim that there is no building with less than 196 feet is supported.

Assumptions made:
- “Building” refers to entries in the public.list_of_tallest_buildings_in_africa table.
- “Less than 196 feet” is interpreted strictly (< 196), so buildings at exactly 196 feet do not violate the claim.
- Verification is scoped to the available dataset (tallest buildings in Africa) and not to all buildings globally.
