Claim assessed: "the yugoslavian national team lose the balkan cup against romania with a aggregate score of 3:4"

Summary of findings:
- The database contains two Yugoslavia vs Romania matches labeled as Balkan Cup fixtures. The scores are 2:0 (in Belgrade) and 1:4 (in Bucharest, Romania). Summing the goals across these two legs yields an aggregate of Yugoslavia 3, Romania 4, meaning Yugoslavia lost the tie on aggregate.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Match details with parsed goals (per match)
SQL:
SELECT "city", "date", "results", 
       CAST(SPLIT_PART("results", ':', 1) AS INTEGER) AS gf, 
       CAST(SPLIT_PART("results", ':', 2) AS INTEGER) AS ga 
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE "opponent" ILIKE '%Romania%' AND "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan%';

Result rows (tool-reported):
- City: Belgrade | Date: March 30 | Results: 2:0 | gf: 2 | ga: 0
- City: Bucharest, Romania | Date: August 27 | Results: 1:4 | gf: 1 | ga: 4

2) Aggregate computation
SQL:
SELECT SUM(CAST(SPLIT_PART("results", ':', 1) AS INTEGER)) AS total_gf, 
       SUM(CAST(SPLIT_PART("results", ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS total_ga 
FROM public.yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE "opponent" ILIKE '%Romania%' AND "type of game" ILIKE '%Balkan%';

Result (tool-reported):
- total_gf: 3, total_ga: 4

Conclusion:
- The data shows Yugoslavia lost to Romania in the Balkan Cup on aggregate 3–4. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- The phrase "lose the balkan cup against romania" is interpreted as "lost a Balkan Cup tie against Romania" (i.e., on aggregate across two legs). The table does not specify the competition stage (e.g., final vs earlier round), so no inference about the tournament stage is made beyond the aggregate result.
