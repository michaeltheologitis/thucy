Claim interpreted: “The winning score of the Vernal Ladies tournament was set in September 2006 at 203.”

Findings grounded in data:
1) Evidence of Vernal Ladies tournament and its winning score
- Result: The only “vernal ladies” entry shows a winning score of 203, dated 15 May 2005, not September 2006.
- Returned rows (excerpt relevant to claim):
  - 15 May 2005 | vernal ladies | 69 + 64 + 70 = 203
  - 24 Sep 2006 | miyagi tv cup dunlop ladies open | 70 + 73 + 71 = 214
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "date", "tournament", "winning score"
  FROM public.ai_miyazato
  WHERE "tournament" ILIKE '%Vernal%' OR "tournament" ILIKE '%Ladies%';

2) Evidence for tournaments in 2006 (to verify any September 2006 event with 203)
- Result: In 2006, the September events recorded are:
  - 10 Sep 2006 | JLPGA Championship Konica Minolta Cup | 70 + 68 + 74 + 70 = 282
  - 24 Sep 2006 | Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open | 70 + 73 + 71 = 214
  None show a 203 winning score, and none is “Vernal Ladies.”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "date", "tournament", "winning score" FROM ai_miyazato WHERE "date" LIKE '%2006';

Conclusion:
- The Vernal Ladies tournament winning score of 203 is supported by the data, but it occurred on 15 May 2005, not in September 2006. September 2006 tournaments listed show winning scores of 282 and 214, not 203. Therefore, the claim is not correct as stated.

Assumptions:
- “vernal ladies tornament” is interpreted as the JLPGA event recorded as “vernal ladies” in the ai_miyazato table.
- Dates are taken as recorded (text format like “15 may 2005” and “24 sep 2006”).
- The TabFact public.ai_miyazato table is treated as authoritative for Ai Miyazato’s recorded tournament wins and details.
