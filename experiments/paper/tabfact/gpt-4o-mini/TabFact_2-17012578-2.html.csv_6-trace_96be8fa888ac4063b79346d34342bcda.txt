Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source with one relevant table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials (2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials rosters).
- Table schema (from schema inspection): columns = skip (text), third / vice skip (text), second (text), lead (text), city (text).

Evidence collected
1) Are there Winnipeg teams with Martin Crête as skip?
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE city ILIKE '%Winnipeg%' ;
Result (abridged to relevant fields):
- City: Winnipeg | Skip: Kerry Burtnyk | Third/Vice: Don Walchuk | Second: Richard Daneault | Lead: Garth Smith
- City: Winnipeg | Skip: Jeff Stoughton | Third/Vice: Kevin Park | Second: Rob Fowler | Lead: Steve Gould
- City: Winnipeg | Skip: Mike McEwen | Third/Vice: B J Neufeld | Second: Matt Wozniak | Lead: Denni Neufeld
Finding: None of the Winnipeg entries list Martin Crête as skip.

2) Where does Martin Crête appear in the table and in what role?
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials WHERE skip ILIKE '%Crête%' OR skip ILIKE '%Crete%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Crête%' OR "third / vice skip" ILIKE '%Crete%' OR second ILIKE '%Crête%' OR second ILIKE '%Crete%' OR lead ILIKE '%Crête%' OR lead ILIKE '%Crete%' ;
Result:
- City: Lévis | Skip: Jean-Michel Ménard | Third/Vice: Martin Crête | Second: Éric Sylvain | Lead: Jean Gagnon
Finding: Martin Crête is listed as the third/vice skip for the Lévis team, not as a skip, and not for a Winnipeg team.

Conclusion
- The claim that “Martin Crête [is] listed as a skip for Winnipeg” is contradicted by the data. In this dataset, Winnipeg skips are Kerry Burtnyk, Jeff Stoughton, and Mike McEwen; Martin Crête appears as third/vice for Lévis.

Assumptions made
- “be list” was interpreted as “is listed” in the context of the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials roster table.
- “for Winnipeg” was interpreted as representing a team with city = Winnipeg in this table.
