Format check of location attendance

- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "location attendance", game, date FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season LIMIT 10;
- Result excerpt:
  | Game | Date        | Location Attendance                  |
  | 51   | February 10 | Target Center 13352                  |
  | 47   | February 1  | Rose Garden 20106                    |

Computation of attendance values
- We parse the trailing number from "location attendance" as the numeric attendance.

1) Lowest attendances (overall order)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, "location attendance", CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '([0-9]+)$') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
  FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  ORDER BY attendance ASC, game ASC
  LIMIT 10;
- Results (lowest 10):
  1) Game 50 | Feb 9  | Time Warner Cable Arena 12376 | 12,376
  2) Game 51 | Feb 10 | Target Center 13352           | 13,352
  3) Game 52 | Feb 16 | Time Warner Cable Arena 13712 | 13,712
  4) Game 55 | Feb 22 | Staples Center 15892          | 15,892
  5) Game 54 | Feb 20 | Bradley Center 17174          | 17,174
  6) Game 48 | Feb 3  | Staples Center 18997          | 18,997
  7) Game 49 | Feb 6  | Time Warner Cable Arena 19164 | 19,164
  8) Game 53 | Feb 19 | Time Warner Cable Arena 19568 | 19,568
  9) Game 56 | Feb 24 | EnergySolutions Arena 19911    | 19,911
  10) Game 47 | Feb 1 | Rose Garden 20106             | 20,106
- The single second entry (overall, including duplicates) is 13,352.
- Confirmation query for the second overall entry:
  SQL executed:
  SELECT game, date, "location attendance", CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '([0-9]+)$') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
  FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  ORDER BY attendance ASC, game ASC
  OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
- Result: Game 51 (February 10) at Target Center with attendance 13,352.

2) Second-lowest unique attendance
- SQL executed:
  WITH parsed AS (
    SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM '([0-9]+)$') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
    FROM t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  ), uniq AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT attendance FROM parsed
  )
  SELECT attendance FROM uniq ORDER BY attendance ASC OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;
- Result: 13,352.

Conclusion
- The lowest attendance is 12,376 (Game 50, Feb 9).
- The second-lowest attendance (both as the second entry overall and as the second unique value) is 13,352, not 12,376.
- Therefore, the claim that the second-lowest attendance figure is 12,376 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Second low attendance figure for a game” was interpreted within the available dataset (Charlotte Bobcats 2009–10 season) and evaluated both as: (a) second item when ordering all games by attendance, and (b) second-lowest unique attendance value. Both interpretations yield 13,352, not 12,376.
