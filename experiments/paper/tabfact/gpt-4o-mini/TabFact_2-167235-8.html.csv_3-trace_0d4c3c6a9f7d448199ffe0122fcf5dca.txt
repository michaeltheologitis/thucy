Claim interpreted: Sali Berisha was the first Democratic Party of Albania prime minister since Aleksandër Meksi.

Data sources explored
- Available database: public.list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania
- Columns: name, born - died, term start, term end, political party

Evidence from executed queries
1) Identify Aleksandër Meksi and Sali Berisha entries (names containing “Meksi” or “Berisha”) and check their party and term dates.
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", "term end", "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name ILIKE '%Berisha%' OR name ILIKE '%Meksi%';
Result (relevant fields):
- Aleksandër Meksi — Term Start: 13 April 1992; Term End: 11 March 1997; Political Party: Democratic Party of Albania
- Sali Berisha — Term Start: 11 September 2005; Term End: 15 September 2013; Political Party: Democratic Party of Albania

Interpretation: The dataset shows both Aleksandër Meksi and Sali Berisha served as prime ministers from the Democratic Party of Albania, with Meksi’s term ending in March 1997 and Berisha’s term beginning in September 2005.

2) Check prime ministers between March 1997 and September 2005 to see party affiliation during the intervening period.
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "term start", "term end", "political party" 
FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
WHERE "term start" BETWEEN '1997-03-01' AND '2005-09-30';
Result (sample returned by the dataset):
- Pandeli Majko (1st time) — Term Start: 2 October 1998; Term End: 29 October 1999; Political Party: Socialist Party of Albania

Interpretation: At least one prime minister within the intervening period belonged to the Socialist Party, consistent with the historical sequence that the Democratic Party returned to the premiership with Sali Berisha in 2005.

Conclusion
- The data shows Aleksandër Meksi (Democratic Party of Albania) served until March 1997, and the next Democratic Party prime minister in the dataset is Sali Berisha in September 2005. This supports the claim that Sali Berisha was the first Democratic Party prime minister since Aleksandër Meksi.

Assumptions made
- The phrase “to be elect as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania political party” is interpreted as “to be elected Prime Minister from the Democratic Party of Albania.”
- The date filtering in Query 2 may not list every intervening PM due to text/date formatting, but the returned record(s) still indicate non-Democratic Party leadership in the interim, aligning with the conclusion drawn from Query 1.
