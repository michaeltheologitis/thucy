Claim interpreted: In 2010, the mixed doubles champions were Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto, and the boys’ singles champion was Nugroho Andi Saputro.

Data source explored: public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships (authoritative dataset of Indonesia’s national badminton championships by category: boys/girls singles/doubles and mixed doubles).

Evidence 1 — 2010 winners (direct lookup):
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2010;
Result:
- Year: 2010
- Boys Singles: Shesar Hiren Rhustavito
- Girls Singles: Gania Nur Rahmadani
- Boys Doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen, Dandi Prabudita
- Girls Doubles: Aris Budiharti, Dian Fitriani
- Mixed Doubles: Jones Ralfy Jansen, Nurbeta Kwanrico

Evidence 2 — Check for the claimed mixed doubles pair anywhere in the dataset:
SQL:
SELECT year, "mixed doubles" FROM indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%Danny Bawa Chrisnanta%' OR "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%Debby Susanto%';
Results:
- Year: 2006, Mixed Doubles: Danny Bawa Chrisnanta Debby Susanto
- Year: 2007, Mixed Doubles: Wifqi Windarto Debby Susanto

Evidence 3 — Check for the claimed boys’ singles name anywhere in the dataset:
SQL:
SELECT year, "boys singles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "boys singles" LIKE '%Nugroho%' OR "boys singles" = 'Nugroho Andi Saputro';
Result: No rows returned (name does not appear as a boys’ singles winner in any year).

Assessment:
- For 2010, the dataset shows mixed doubles champions were Jones Ralfy Jansen and Nurbeta Kwanrico, not Danny Bawa Chrisnanta and Debby Susanto.
- For 2010, the boys’ singles champion was Shesar Hiren Rhustavito, not Nugroho Andi Saputro.
- The pair Danny Bawa Chrisnanta/Debby Susanto did win mixed doubles in 2006 (not 2010). There is no record of Nugroho Andi Saputro as a boys’ singles champion in this dataset.

Conclusion: The claim about the 2010 winners is contradicted by the authoritative data provided above.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Indonesian National (junior) Badminton Championships dataset provided (columns labeled boys/girls indicate junior categories). Names are matched by exact/substring text within the winners fields.
