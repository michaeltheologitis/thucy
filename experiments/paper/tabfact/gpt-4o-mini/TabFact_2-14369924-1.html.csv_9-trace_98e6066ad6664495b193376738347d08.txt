Claim to verify:
- “The ERP (W) and class for W290AG and W230AV are 55 and D for both, and one has a city of license of Anniston, Alabama and the other has a city of license of Macon, Georgia.”

Data sources consulted:
- Database: TabFact (public schema)
- Table: wyfk
- Relevant columns: call sign (text), frequency mhz (text), city of license (text), erp w (bigint), class (text), fcc info (text)

Evidence gathered (executed SQL and results):
1) List all rows to see available call signs and attributes
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "erp w", "class" FROM wyfk;
Results snapshot:
- w230av — Gadsden, Alabama; ERP 10; Class d
- w269ax — Anniston, Alabama; ERP 10; Class d
- w273ae — Albany, Georgia; ERP 55; Class d
- w282ae — Macon, Georgia; ERP 27; Class d
- w290ag — Griffin, Georgia; ERP 27; Class d

2) Specific check: W290AG
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "erp w", "class" FROM wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'w290ag';
Result:
- City of License: Griffin, Georgia; ERP W: 27; Class: D

3) Specific check: W230AV
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", "city of license", "erp w", "class" FROM public.wyfk WHERE "call sign" = 'w230av';
Result:
- City of License: Gadsden, Alabama; ERP W: 10; Class: D

Assessment of each part of the claim:
- “Class D for both W290AG and W230AV” — Supported by data (both are Class D).
- “ERP 55 W for both” — Contradicted by data. W290AG has 27 W and W230AV has 10 W.
- “One is licensed to Anniston, Alabama and the other to Macon, Georgia” — Contradicted by data for these call signs. W290AG is licensed to Griffin, Georgia; W230AV to Gadsden, Alabama. Note: Anniston, Alabama in this table corresponds to W269AX; Macon, Georgia corresponds to W282AE; 55 W ERP corresponds to W273AE (Albany, Georgia).

Conclusion: The claim is mostly incorrect, except for both being Class D.

Assumptions made:
- The call signs provided refer to FM translators listed in the wyfk table exactly as stored (lowercase in this dataset).
- The TabFact.public.wyfk table is treated as authoritative per instructions.
