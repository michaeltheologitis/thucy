Claim to verify: “Pakistan and Yemen have won 3 bronze medals for Wushu at the Asian Games.”

Data source inspected
- Database: public schema
- Table: wushu_at_the_asian_games
- Columns: rank (text), nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint)

Evidence
1) Check all nation entries and their bronze counts to locate Pakistan and Yemen
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT nation, bronze FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Pakistan (PAK): bronze = 1
- Yemen (YEM): bronze = 1
(Other rows present but omitted here; a “Total” aggregate row also exists.)

2) Directly retrieve Pakistan and Yemen rows and their bronze counts (case-insensitive, allowing for name variations like “Pakistan (PAK)”, “Yemen (YEM)”) 
SQL executed:
SELECT nation, SUM(bronze) AS total_bronze 
FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE nation ILIKE 'Pakistan%' OR nation ILIKE 'Yemen%'
GROUP BY nation;
Results:
- pakistan (pak) — total_bronze = 1
- yemen (yem) — total_bronze = 1

3) Compute combined bronze total for Pakistan and Yemen
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(bronze) AS total_bronze 
FROM wushu_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE LOWER(nation) LIKE 'pakistan%' OR LOWER(nation) LIKE 'yemen%';
Result:
- combined total_bronze = 2

Assessment
- Pakistan bronze in Wushu at the Asian Games: 1
- Yemen bronze in Wushu at the Asian Games: 1
- Combined Pakistan + Yemen bronze: 2
- The claim that “Pakistan and Yemen have won 3 bronze medals” is not supported. Whether interpreted as each having 3 or combined having 3, the data shows only 1 each (2 combined).

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: Pakistan and Yemen have a combined 2 bronze medals in Wushu at the Asian Games, not 3.

Assumptions
- “Asian game” is interpreted as the Asian Games, and the table represents cumulative Wushu medal counts by nation across Asian Games editions. 
- “Pakistan” and “Yemen” rows correspond to “Pakistan (PAK)” and “Yemen (YEM)” in the nation column.
