Scope and data source
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1927_vfl_season, containing 1927 VFL match data.
- Table schema (from inspection): columns include "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text). No defined primary keys or relationships.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Confirm that both team names exist in the dataset
- Purpose: Ensure we use the correct team name strings.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "home team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
  UNION
  SELECT DISTINCT "away team" AS team_name FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season;
- Result excerpt includes: Carlton, St Kilda (as well as other 1927 VFL clubs). This confirms the correct team name strings appear in the data.

2) Check for any Carlton vs St Kilda matches (either home/away order) in 1927
- Purpose: Determine whether there is any recorded match between these teams in the dataset and, if so, whether Carlton is the away team.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue
  FROM public.t_1927_vfl_season
  WHERE ("home team" = 'Carlton' AND "away team" = 'St Kilda')
     OR ("home team" = 'St Kilda' AND "away team" = 'Carlton');
- Result: No rows returned. Within the scope of the 1927 season data, there is no recorded match between Carlton and St Kilda.

Conclusion
- Based on the available 1927 VFL season dataset, there is no evidence that Carlton played St Kilda at all; therefore, the claim that “Carlton be the away team when they play St Kilda” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted within the scope of the accessible dataset (1927 VFL season). If the claim refers to another season or a future fixture, that is outside the available data.
- Team names are standardized as “Carlton” and “St Kilda,” matching the dataset’s strings.
