Claim to verify: “Team Australia is the only football club located in Oceania.”

Step 1: Explore available data sources
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database, schema: public
- Available table: list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, "football club", continent, "associated football club", seasons, "racing drivers")

Step 2: Understand dataset scope
- This table lists football-branded entries associated with the Superleague Formula. It includes a continent field, which we use to evaluate whether Oceania has more than one entry.

Step 3: Evidence from data
A) Distinct continents and counts
- Result: Oceania has 2 entries (not 1)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS count 
  FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs 
  GROUP BY continent 
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Returned (relevant excerpt):
  • Europe: 9
  • Oceania: 2
  • Asia: 2
  • South America: 1

B) List the clubs in Oceania
- Result: Two clubs appear under Oceania: Team New Zealand and Team Australia
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE continent ILIKE '%Oceania%';
- Returned rows:
  • Football Club: Team New Zealand, Continent: Oceania
  • Football Club: Team Australia, Continent: Oceania

C) Confirm presence of “Team Australia”
- Result: “Team Australia” is present and tagged as Oceania
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", continent FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" = 'Team Australia' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Australia%';
- Returned row (relevant):
  • Football Club: Team Australia, Continent: Oceania

Conclusion
- The dataset shows two Oceania entries: Team Australia and Team New Zealand. Therefore, the claim that Team Australia is the only football club located in Oceania is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Football club” refers to entries in the table list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs.
- “Located in Oceania” is determined by the table’s continent field. I used ILIKE to avoid potential formatting/case inconsistencies in the continent values.
