Conclusion: Yes — the 1996 results differ between the Australian Open and the French Open (in this dataset).

What the data shows
- Dataset context: The available database contains a table of Katrina Adams’ Grand Slam results by year. The rows are tournament names and the columns are years (including 1996). Cell values are round codes (e.g., qf for quarterfinal, 1r for first round, a appears to denote absence/no result).
- For 1996:
  - Australian Open: a
  - French Open: qf
  These values are different.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Enumerate tables in the public schema
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
Result: katrina_adams

Row count check:
SQL:
SELECT relname, n_live_tup FROM pg_stat_user_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public';
Result: katrina_adams has 5 rows

2) Describe columns and fetch all rows from public.katrina_adams
List columns:
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'katrina_adams' ORDER BY ordinal_position;
Key columns (subset shown): tournament (text), ... , 1996 (text)

Fetch all rows:
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams;
Relevant output excerpt for 1996:
- Row tournament='australian open' → "1996" = 'a'
- Row tournament='french open' → "1996" = 'qf'

3) Targeted confirmation (by tournament)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'australian open' AND "1996" IS NOT NULL;
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament = 'french open' AND "1996" IS NOT NULL;
Narrative result from execution: Australian Open shows 'a' for 1996; French Open shows 'qf' for 1996.

Answer
- The 1996 result for the Australian Open is recorded as 'a', while the 1996 result for the French Open is 'qf'. These are different.

Assumptions
- Interpreting "result" as the value recorded in the 1996 column for each tournament in the available dataset (which contains Katrina Adams’ Grand Slam results by year). Common tennis notation suggests 'qf' = quarterfinal; 'a' typically indicates absence or no participation. Even without decoding, the two recorded values are clearly different.
