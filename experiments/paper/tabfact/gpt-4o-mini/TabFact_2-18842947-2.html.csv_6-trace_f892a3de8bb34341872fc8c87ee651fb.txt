Claim to verify: "the highest attendance figure for a game be 42048"

Data sources explored:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, public schema, table t_1976_detroit_lions_season (columns: week bigint, date text, opponent text, result text, attendance bigint).

Method:
1) Identify the maximum attendance recorded in the dataset.
2) Check if 42,048 appears and, if so, whether it is the maximum.

Evidence:
1) Highest attendance game in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance 
FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season 
ORDER BY attendance DESC 
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- week: 11
- date: November 21, 1976
- opponent: Chicago Bears
- result: W 14 - 10
- attendance: 78,042

2) Direct maximum confirmation
SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season;
Result:
- max_attendance: 78,042

3) Presence of the specific figure 42,048
SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance 
FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season 
WHERE attendance = 42048;
Result:
- week: 10
- date: November 14, 1976
- opponent: New Orleans Saints
- result: L 17 - 16
- attendance: 42,048

Conclusion:
- The highest recorded attendance in the available data (1976 Detroit Lions season) is 78,042, not 42,048. While 42,048 does appear as an attendance figure for Week 10 vs. the New Orleans Saints, it is not the maximum.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the only available dataset (1976 Detroit Lions season) and interprets “the highest attendance figure for a game” as the maximum value in the attendance column across all listed games in that season.
