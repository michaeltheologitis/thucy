Summary of findings
- Available data source: PostgreSQL public schema with a single table: public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season (authoritative for this verification).
- The table stores Rangers F.C. 2008–09 season player movements with columns nat, name, moving to, type, transfer window, transfer fee.

Key evidence from the data
1) Distinct movement types and their counts
- Result: loan = 20, end of contract = 7, transfer = 6
- SQL: SELECT type, COUNT(*) as count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY type;

2) Total movements by nationality (all types)
- Result (ordered ascending by count):
  • Ivory Coast: 1
  • Slovakia: 1
  • RSA: 1
  • France (fra): 1
  • Gabon: 1
  • Cyprus (cyp): 1
  • Spain (esp): 1
  • Belgium (bel): 2
  • England (eng): 2
  • Scotland (sco): 22
- SQL: SELECT nat, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season GROUP BY nat ORDER BY row_count ASC;

3) Transfers only (type = 'transfer') by nationality
- Result (ordered ascending by count): bel = 1, esp = 1, fra = 1, gabon = 1, sco = 1, slovakia = 1
  • Scotland (sco) has 1 transfer, tied with several others; not 22.
- SQL: SELECT nat, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.t_2008_09_rangers_f_c_season WHERE type = 'transfer' GROUP BY nat ORDER BY row_count ASC;

Assessment of the claim: "sco have the lowest amount of transfer at 22"
- If "transfer" means all movements regardless of type: Scotland (sco) has 22 total records, which is the highest count, not the lowest.
- If "transfer" is strictly type = 'transfer': Scotland (sco) has 1, tied for the lowest with several others, but the value is 1, not 22.
- Therefore, the statement is not supported by the data in any reasonable interpretation.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. SCO does not have the lowest amount of transfers at 22. Either SCO has 22 total movements (the highest), or 1 transfer (tied for the lowest but not 22).

Assumptions made (due to brevity/ambiguity of the claim)
- "sco" refers to the nat code "SCO" for Scotland in the nat column.
- "transfer" could plausibly mean either: (a) any movement entry in the table (all types), or (b) strictly rows where type = 'transfer'.
- "amount" is interpreted as a count of records (not a monetary fee), because transfer fee is stored as text and 22 does not appear as a fee in this dataset.
