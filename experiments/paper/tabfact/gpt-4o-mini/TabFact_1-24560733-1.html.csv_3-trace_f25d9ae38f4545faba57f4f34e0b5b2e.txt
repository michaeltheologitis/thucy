Claim to verify: “the wildcat play 2 game in september, 4 game in october, and 4 game in november.”

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team (Kentucky Wildcats football, 1947)

Step 1: Inspect date formats to determine month labeling
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team ORDER BY date LIMIT 50;
Result (abridged):
- sept 20
- sept 27
- oct 4
- oct 11
- oct 18
- oct 25
- nov 1
- nov 8
- nov 15
- nov 22
Observation: Months are abbreviated in lowercase as “sept”, “oct”, “nov”.

Step 2: Count games in September, October, November using the observed month prefixes
Executed SQL and results:
1) September
SELECT COUNT(*) AS september_games FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'sept%';
Result: 2

2) October
SELECT COUNT(*) AS october_games FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'oct%';
Result: 4

3) November
SELECT COUNT(*) AS november_games FROM public.t_1947_kentucky_wildcats_football_team WHERE LOWER(date) LIKE 'nov%';
Result: 4

Conclusion: The data shows 2 games in September, 4 in October, and 4 in November for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football team, which matches the claim.

Assumptions made:
- “the wildcat” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team because the accessible, authoritative data source available is for the 1947 Kentucky Wildcats football season.
