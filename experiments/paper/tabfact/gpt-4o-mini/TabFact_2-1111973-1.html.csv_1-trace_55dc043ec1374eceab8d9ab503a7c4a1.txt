Claim interpreted: The VCA (Vehículo de Combate de Artillería) weighs 40 t (44.1 short tons) and mounts a 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer; the VCTM (Vehículo de Combate Transporte de Mortero) weighs 26 t (28.7 short tons) and mounts a 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar.

Evidence from the connected database
1) Discover available data sources
- Result: A PostgreSQL database with a table public.tam_tank is available.

2) Inspect table structure to confirm relevant columns
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, character_maximum_length
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = 'tam_tank';
- SQL executed:
  SELECT a.attname, t.typname, a.attnotnull
  FROM pg_attribute a
  JOIN pg_type t ON a.atttypid = t.oid
  WHERE a.attrelid = 'public.tam_tank'::regclass AND a.attnum > 0 AND NOT a.attisdropped;
- SQL executed:
  SELECT kcu.column_name,
         tc.constraint_type
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu
    ON kcu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name
  WHERE kcu.table_name = 'tam_tank';
- Outcome: Table public.tam_tank has columns including vctp, "vca 155", vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt (all text). No constraints.

3) Retrieve the data
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
- Relevant returned cells (by column):
  • Column "vca 155":
    - Row 1: 40t (44.1tons)
    - Row 2: 155 mm (6.1in) l / 41 howitzer
  • Column vctm:
    - Row 1: 26t (28.7tons)
    - Row 2: 120 mm (4.72in) mortar

Assessment
- The data explicitly shows:
  • VCA 155: weight = 40t (44.1 tons); main armament = 155 mm (6.1 in) L/41 howitzer.
  • VCTM: weight = 26t (28.7 tons); main armament = 120 mm (4.72 in) mortar.
- These directly match the user’s statement.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data as stored in public.tam_tank.

Assumptions made
- "tons" in parentheses are short tons (as implied by 40 t ≈ 44.1 short tons and 26 t ≈ 28.7 short tons).
- "vca" refers to the VCA 155 variant and "vctm" refers to the TAM-family mortar carrier variant, as per column labels in the dataset.
