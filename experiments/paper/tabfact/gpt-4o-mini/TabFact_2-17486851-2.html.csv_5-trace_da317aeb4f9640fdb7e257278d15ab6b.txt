Claim to verify: “Paulo Costa (POR) will retire at the end of the season.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: public (PostgreSQL)
- Table: t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
- Columns: nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text), source (text)

Evidence collected
1) Existence and status of Paulo Costa in the dataset
- Result: A record exists for Paulo Costa (Portugal), indicating a mid-season move rather than retirement.
- Key fields observed: nat = Portugal (por), name = Paulo Costa, moving to = Anorthosis Famagusta, type = Mutual consent loan return, transfer window = Winter, transfer fee = Free, source = apoelfccomcy
- SQL executed:
  SELECT nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer window", "transfer fee", source
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Paulo Costa%' OR (name ILIKE '%Costa%' AND name ILIKE '%Paulo%');

2) Check for any retirement events, especially for Paulo Costa
- Result: The table contains a retirement event for Michalis Machlas (type = Retirement, moving to = Retired). There is no retirement entry for Paulo Costa.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  WHERE (name ILIKE '%Paulo Costa%' AND type ILIKE '%retirement%') OR type ILIKE '%retirement%';

3) Check whether “end of season” (or any “end” label) is used and whether it applies to Paulo Costa
- Result: The dataset uses “End of Contract” in the type field for some players (e.g., Makrides, Louka, Kapsis, Daskalakis). No such “end” label applies to Paulo Costa; his entry indicates Winter window and a loan return by mutual consent.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT *
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  WHERE "transfer window" ILIKE '%end%' OR type ILIKE '%end%';

Findings
- Paulo Costa (POR) appears in the APOEL FC 2008–09 season dataset.
- His status is a winter transfer/move (“Mutual consent loan return” to Anorthosis Famagusta), not retirement.
- There is no evidence of a retirement event for Paulo Costa in this dataset, nor an event labeled as occurring at the “end of the season” for him.

Conclusion
- The available data contradicts the claim that Paulo Costa (POR) retired at the end of the season. The data shows a winter move by mutual consent/loan return, not a retirement.

Assumptions made
- “Paulo Costa of POR” refers to the Portuguese player record present in the APOEL FC 2008–09 season table.
- “End of the season” refers to the end of the 2008–09 season covered by the available dataset.
