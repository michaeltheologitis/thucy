Claim to verify: "quentin be 1 of the police offer who be in the cube" (interpreted as: Quentin is a police officer character in the Cube film series).

Data source explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: cube_film_series (columns: name, occupation, gender, prison connection, played by, status)

Evidence from executed SQL
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, occupation FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE name ILIKE '%Quentin%';
  Result:
  - name: quentin
  - occupation: police officer

Notes on exploration
- An initial exact-match check returned no rows (due to case/exact-name matching):
  Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.cube_film_series WHERE name = 'Quentin';
  Result: 0 rows
- Broadening to a case-insensitive partial match located the character entry.

Conclusion
The database explicitly lists a character named "quentin" with the occupation "police officer" in the Cube film series table. This supports the claim that Quentin is (one of) the police officer(s) in the Cube.

Assumptions
- "in the cube" refers to the Cube film series.
- "police offer" is a misspelling of "police officer".
