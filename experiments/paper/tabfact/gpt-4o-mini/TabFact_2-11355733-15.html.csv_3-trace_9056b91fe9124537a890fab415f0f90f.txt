Scope and data source
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya (2007 Volta a Catalunya race data).

Step 1: Inspect table schema
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 't_2007_volta_a_catalunya';
Result (summarized):
- cyclist: text
- country: text
- team: text
- time: text
- uci points: text

Step 2: Identify exact team names in the dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya ORDER BY team;
Result (relevant entries):
- ag2r prévoyance
- caisse d'epargne
(plus other teams not relevant to this claim)

Step 3: Aggregate total UCI points per team (to understand overall distribution)
Executed SQL:
SELECT team, SUM(CASE WHEN "uci points" ~ '^[0-9]+$' THEN ("uci points")::int ELSE 0 END) AS total_points 
FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya 
GROUP BY team 
ORDER BY total_points DESC;
Result (excerpt):
- Caisse d'Epargne: 50 points
- AG2R Prévoyance: 45 points
(others omitted)

Step 4: Direct comparison of the two teams in question
Executed SQL (AG2R Prévoyance):
SELECT team, SUM(CASE WHEN "uci points" ~ '^[0-9]+' THEN ("uci points")::int ELSE 0 END) AS total_uci_points
FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya
WHERE team = 'ag2r prévoyance'
GROUP BY team;
Result: 45

Executed SQL (Caisse d'Epargne):
SELECT team, SUM(CASE WHEN "uci points" ~ '^[0-9]+' THEN ("uci points")::int ELSE 0 END) AS total_uci_points
FROM public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya
WHERE team = 'caisse d''epargne'
GROUP BY team;
Result: 50

Conclusion
- In this dataset, AG2R Prévoyance has 45 cumulative UCI points, while Caisse d'Epargne has 50. Therefore, AG2R Prévoyance does not have more points than Caisse d'Epargne.

Assumptions
- “Cumulatively” is interpreted as the sum of the “uci points” field across all rows for each team within the table public.t_2007_volta_a_catalunya (2007 Volta a Catalunya). Non-numeric or blank points were treated as zero, as implemented in the queries above.
- Team name matching uses the exact strings present in the dataset (lowercase with diacritics and apostrophes).
