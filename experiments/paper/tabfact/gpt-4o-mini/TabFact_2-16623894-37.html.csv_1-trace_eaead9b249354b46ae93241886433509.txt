Claim to verify: "werder bremen , who be in team 2 , have a score of 4 - 4 in the 2nd leg"

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league
  - Columns: "team 1" (text), "agg" (text), "team 2" (text), "1st leg" (text), "2nd leg" (text)

Evidence collected:
1) Locate any rows involving Werder Bremen to understand context
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" 
FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league 
WHERE "team 1" ILIKE '%Werder Bremen%' OR "team 2" ILIKE '%Werder Bremen%';

Result (1 row):
- Team 1: Valencia
- Team 2: Werder Bremen
- 1st Leg: 1 - 1
- 2nd Leg: 4 - 4
- Aggregate: 5 - 5 (a)

2) Verify specifically that Werder Bremen appears as team 2 with a 2nd leg score of 4-4
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", "1st leg", "2nd leg", "agg" FROM public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league WHERE lower("team 2") = 'werder bremen' AND ("2nd leg" LIKE '%4-4%' OR "2nd leg" LIKE '%4 - 4%' OR "2nd leg" LIKE '%4/4%');

Result (1 row):
- Team 1: Valencia
- Team 2: Werder Bremen
- 1st Leg: 1 - 1
- 2nd Leg: 4 - 4
- Aggregate: 5 - 5 (a)

Conclusion:
The dataset contains a match where Werder Bremen is listed as team 2, and the 2nd leg score is 4 - 4. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "team 2" and "2nd leg" as the columns of the same names in the table public.t_2009_10_uefa_europa_league.
- The claim context is the UEFA Europa League 2009-2010 season, as that is the available dataset.
- Allowed minor formatting variations in the score representation (e.g., spaces/dashes) when matching the 2nd leg score.
