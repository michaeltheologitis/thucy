Key evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate the December 17 episode
SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "original air date" ~* 'December\s+17';

Result:
- Season: 6 | Series: 43 | Episode title: music special | Original air date: december 17 , 1996 | Nick prod: 343

2) Locate episodes referencing Ray J or titled '702'
SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
FROM list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%Ray J%' OR "episode title" ILIKE '%702%';

Results:
- Episode title: 702 | Season: 8 | Series: 45 | Original air date: December 28, 1996 | Nick prod: 345
- Episode title: ray j | Season: 14 | Series: 51 | Original air date: February 8, 1997 | Nick prod: 351

3) Combined comparison (ordered by production number)
SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod"
FROM list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE ("original air date" ~* 'December\s+17')
   OR ("episode title" ILIKE '%Ray J%')
   OR ("episode title" = '702')
ORDER BY "nick prod" ASC;

Results (by nick prod):
- music special | December 17, 1996 | Nick prod: 343
- 702 | December 28, 1996 | Nick prod: 345
- ray j | February 8, 1997 | Nick prod: 351

Assessment
- December 17 episode nick prod: 343
- '702' episode nick prod: 345
- Ray J episode nick prod: 351
343 is less than both 345 and 351, so the December 17 episode does NOT have a higher production number than the other two.

Assumptions
- The dataset public.list_of_all_that_episodes represents the show "All That".
- “Ray J episode” is interpreted as the row whose episode title contains “Ray J”.
- “Episode title '702'” is interpreted as the row with episode title exactly '702'.
- “Production number” corresponds to the column nick prod.
- “The episode that air on December 17” refers to the entry with original air date matching December 17 (found: December 17, 1996).
