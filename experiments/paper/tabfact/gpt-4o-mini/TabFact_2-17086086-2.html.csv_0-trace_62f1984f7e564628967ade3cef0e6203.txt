Claim to verify: “the opponent in the final on July 9, 1990 be Barbara Paulus.”

How I interpreted the claim
- Given the available data source contains Isabel Cueto’s finals, I interpret the claim as: For Isabel Cueto, the opponent in the final played on 9 July 1990 was Barbara Paulus.

Data source explored
- Available database: PostgreSQL with a single table public.isabel_cueto.
- Relevant columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent in the final (text), score (text).

Evidence from the data
- Result found:
  - Date: 9 July 1990
  - Tournament: Palermo, Italy
  - Opponent in the final: Barbara Paulus
  - Score: 6 - 2, 6 - 3

Executed SQL (as evidence)
SELECT "date", "tournament", "opponent in the final", "score" 
FROM isabel_cueto 
WHERE "date"::date >= '1990-01-01' AND "date"::date < '1991-01-01';

Assessment
- The data explicitly shows that on 9 July 1990, the opponent in the final was Barbara Paulus. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “The final” refers to Isabel Cueto’s final match entry on that date, as the only available dataset is about Isabel Cueto.
- The date “July 9, 1990” corresponds to the entry formatted as “9 July 1990.”
