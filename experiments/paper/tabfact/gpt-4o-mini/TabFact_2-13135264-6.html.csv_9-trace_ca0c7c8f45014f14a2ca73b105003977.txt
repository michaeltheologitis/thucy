Claim interpreted: “there be a tie for the largest point gap 2 time during the season.” Interpreted as: within the available 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings game log dataset, the largest game point gap (goal differential) occurred in two games (i.e., a tie for largest margin happened twice).

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season containing 14 game records for the Detroit Red Wings (2003–04 season segment).

Schema used
- Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text, formatted like “x - y”), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).
- Goal differential computed as ABS(visitor_goals - home_goals), where visitor_goals = split_part(score, '-', 1)::int and home_goals = split_part(score, '-', 2)::int.

Evidence and results
1) Maximum goal differential across all games
- SQL: SELECT MAX(ABS(CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INT) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INT))) AS max_goal_diff FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: max_goal_diff = 6

2) How many games have that maximum differential
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS max_goal_diff_count FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE ABS(CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INT) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INT)) = 6;
- Result: max_goal_diff_count = 1

3) Identify the game(s) with that maximum differential
- SQL: SELECT date, visitor, home, ABS(CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INT) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INT)) AS goal_diff FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season WHERE ABS(CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INT) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INT)) = 6;
- Result: Date = January 5; Visitor = Nashville; Home = Detroit; goal_diff = 6 (game score in sample rows: 0 - 6)

Conclusion
- The largest point gap (interpreted as goal differential) is 6, and it occurred in only 1 game in the dataset. Therefore, there was not a tie for the largest point gap occurring two times.

Assumptions
- “Point gap” is interpreted as goal differential (difference in goals scored in a game), as the dataset contains game scores, not standings points gaps.
- “During the season” refers to the scope of the available dataset (14 games from the 2003–04 Detroit Red Wings game log).
