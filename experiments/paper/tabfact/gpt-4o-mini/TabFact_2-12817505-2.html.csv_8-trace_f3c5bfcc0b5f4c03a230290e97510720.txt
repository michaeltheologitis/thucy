Summary
Claim: “the last game of the season happen on 11 february 2006.”
Verdict: Inaccurate based on the available season data.

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact-like) with a table for Manchester United’s 2005–06 league season.
- Table: public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
- Columns: date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text)

What the data shows
1) The actual last match date in this season
- SQL:
  SELECT TO_CHAR(MAX(TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY')), 'DD Month YYYY') AS max_match_date FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season;
- Result: 07 May 2006

2) Details of the last match
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance, "league position"
  FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') = DATE '2006-05-07';
- Result: 7 May 2006 — Charlton Athletic — Home — 4 - 0 — Attendance 73,006 — League Position 2nd

3) Was there a match on 11 February 2006?
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance, "league position"
  FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') = DATE '2006-02-11';
- Result: 11 February 2006 — Portsmouth — Away — 3 - 1 — Attendance 20,206 — League Position 2nd

4) There were matches after 11 February 2006 (so 11 Feb was not the last game)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a"
  FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
  WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') > DATE '2006-02-11'
  ORDER BY TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') ASC
  LIMIT 10;
- Sample results after 11 Feb 2006:
  - 6 March 2006 — Wigan Athletic — Away — 2 - 1
  - 12 March 2006 — Newcastle United — Home — 2 - 0
  - 18 March 2006 — West Bromwich Albion — Away — 2 - 1
  - 26 March 2006 — Birmingham City — Home — 3 - 0
  - 29 March 2006 — West Ham United — Home — 1 - 0
  - 1 April 2006 — Bolton Wanderers — Away — 2 - 1
  - 9 April 2006 — Arsenal — Home — 2 - 0
  - 14 April 2006 — Sunderland — Home — 0 - 0
  - 17 April 2006 — Tottenham Hotspur — Away — 2 - 1
  - 29 April 2006 — Chelsea — Away — 0 - 3
  - 1 May 2006 — Middlesbrough — Home — 0 - 0
  - 7 May 2006 — Charlton Athletic — Home — 4 - 0 (season’s last match)

Conclusion
- The last game of the season (in this dataset) was on 7 May 2006, not 11 February 2006. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- “The season” is interpreted as Manchester United F.C.’s 2005–06 league season, as that is the only available dataset. If a different team/competition/season was intended, results could differ, but no other data sources were available here.
