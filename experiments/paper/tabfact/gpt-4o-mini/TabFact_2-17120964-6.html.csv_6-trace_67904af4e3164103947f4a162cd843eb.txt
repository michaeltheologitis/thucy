Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the away match has a 2 - 3 result. I verify this against the available Guildford Flames 2008–09 season dataset.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Table: public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season

Schema summary (relevant columns):
- date (text), opponent (text), venue (text: Home/Away), result (text), competition (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for any away match with a 2 - 3 score
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE venue = 'Away' AND result LIKE '%2 - 3%' ORDER BY date;
- Result: No rows returned. This indicates there are no away matches recorded with a 2 - 3 scoreline in this dataset.

2) Verify if a 2 - 3 score exists at all (to ensure the pattern is present in the data and see its venue)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season WHERE result LIKE '%2 - 3%' ORDER BY date;
- Returned row(s) include:
  • Date: 1st | Opponent: Slough Jets | Venue: Home | Result: Lost 2 - 3
- Interpretation: A 2 - 3 result appears in the data, but it is a Home match, not an Away match.

3) Context sample showing how away results are recorded (to confirm venue usage in this dataset)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, competition 
FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season 
ORDER BY date 
LIMIT 500;
- Sample rows returned (subset shown by the tool):
  • 2nd | Slough Jets | Away | Lost 5 - 6 (OT) | League
  • 15th | Sheffield Scimitars | Away | Won 7 - 4 | League / Cup
  • 22nd | Wightlink Raiders | Away | Lost 5 - 4 | League / Cup
  • 30th | Bracknell Bees | Away | Won 4 - 0 | League / Cup
  • 8th | Swindon Wildcats | Away | Won 6 - 3 | League / Cup
- Interpretation: Away matches are present, but none in this sample carry a 2 - 3 scoreline.

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows no away match with a 2 - 3 result. A 2 - 3 scoreline exists, but it is associated with a home fixture (vs Slough Jets). Therefore, the claim that “the away match have a 2 - 3 result” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the Guildford Flames 2008–09 season dataset available in the connected database.
- “Away match” is interpreted as any row where venue = 'Away'.
- “2 - 3 result” is matched by the textual pattern '2 - 3' within the result field, regardless of additional annotations like (OT) or (PS).
