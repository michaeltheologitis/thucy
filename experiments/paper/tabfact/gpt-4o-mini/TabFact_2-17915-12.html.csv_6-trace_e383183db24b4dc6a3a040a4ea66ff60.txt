Claim to verify: “19 of Lleyton Hewitt Masters Series finals have one side or the other finishing with 4 point.”

Interpretation (stated up front due to ambiguous phrasing): I interpret “finishing with 4 point” as a set in the final with a game score of 6 - 4 or 4 - 6 (i.e., one player finished the set with 4 games). I also check an alternative reading where a tiebreak “finishes with 4 points” (i.e., a tiebreak score of 7 - 4 or 4 - 7).

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
- SQL: SELECT nspname AS schema_name FROM pg_catalog.pg_namespace;
- SQL: SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
Result (abridged): public.lleyton_hewitt exists.

Step 2 — Inspect table schema
- SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable, column_default, character_maximum_length, numeric_precision, numeric_scale FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'lleyton_hewitt';
Result: Columns: year (bigint), outcome (text), championship (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text).

Step 3 — View the data
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Rows:
• 2000 | runner - up | stuttgart        | hard (i)   | wayne ferreira | 6 - 7 (6 - 8), 6 - 3, 7 - 6 (7 - 5), 6 - 7 (2 - 7), 2 - 6
• 2002 | winner      | indian wells     | hard       | tim henman     | 6 - 1, 6 - 2
• 2002 | runner - up | cincinnati       | hard       | carlos moyá    | 5 - 7, 6 - 7 (5 - 7)
• 2002 | runner - up | paris            | carpet (i) | marat safin    | 6 - 7 (4 - 7), 0 - 6, 4 - 6
• 2003 | winner      | indian wells (2) | hard       | gustavo kuerten| 6 - 1, 6 - 1
• 2004 | runner - up | cincinnati (2)   | hard       | andre agassi   | 3 - 6, 6 - 3, 2 - 6
• 2005 | runner - up | indian wells     | hard       | roger federer  | 2 - 6, 4 - 6, 4 - 6

Step 4 — Finals containing at least one set that ended 6 - 4 or 4 - 6
- SQL: SELECT year, championship, score FROM public.lleyton_hewitt WHERE score LIKE '%4 - 6%' OR score LIKE '%6 - 4%';
Result: 2 finals
• 2002 | Paris        | 6 - 7 (4 - 7), 0 - 6, 4 - 6
• 2005 | Indian Wells | 2 - 6, 4 - 6, 4 - 6
Interpretation: Only 2 of Hewitt’s Masters Series finals include a set with 4 games on one side (not 19).

Step 5 — Count of sets (not finals) ending 6 - 4 or 4 - 6 across all his Masters Series finals
- SQL: SELECT SUM( (length(score) - length(replace(score, '4 - 6', ''))) / length('4 - 6') + (length(score) - length(replace(score, '6 - 4', ''))) / length('6 - 4') ) AS total_sets_with_4 FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: total_sets_with_4 = 3
Interpretation: Across all finals, only 3 sets ended 6 - 4 or 4 - 6.

Step 6 — Alternative interpretation: tiebreaks where one side finished with 4 points (7 - 4 or 4 - 7)
- SQL: SELECT SUM( (length(score) - length(replace(score, '(4 - 7)', ''))) / length('(4 - 7)') + (length(score) - length(replace(score, '(7 - 4)', ''))) / length('(7 - 4)') ) AS tiebreaks_with_side_scoring_4 FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: tiebreaks_with_side_scoring_4 = 1
Interpretation: Only one tiebreak across these finals had a side on 4 points (specifically 6 - 7 (4 - 7) in Paris 2002).

Conclusion
- The data show 7 Masters Series finals for Lleyton Hewitt in this table. Only 2 of these finals include any set with a 6 - 4/4 - 6 score, totaling 3 such sets across all finals. If interpreted via tiebreak points, only 1 tiebreak shows a side finishing with 4 points. None of these quantities approaches 19. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions (due to ambiguous wording)
- “Master series final” refers to ATP Masters Series/ATP Masters 1000 finals listed in this table.
- “Finishing with 4 point” primarily interpreted as set game score ending 6 - 4 or 4 - 6; secondarily checked as tiebreak scores 7 - 4 or 4 - 7.
- The table public.lleyton_hewitt contains all relevant Masters Series finals for Hewitt and is treated as authoritative within this context.
