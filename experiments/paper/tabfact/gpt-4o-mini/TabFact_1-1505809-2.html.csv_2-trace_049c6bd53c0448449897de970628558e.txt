Claim to verify: “10 be the lowest value of blank end when the win (w) be 6.” Interpreted as: Among teams with w = 6, the minimum value of the “blank ends” column is 10.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with public schema containing curling data for the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier.
- Tables in public schema (SQL executed):
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier

Schema inspection
- Columns for public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier (SQL executed):
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_2005_tim_hortons_brier' 
  AND table_schema = 'public';
  Result columns:
  - locale (text)
  - skip (text)
  - w (bigint)
  - l (bigint)
  - pf (bigint)
  - pa (bigint)
  - ends won (bigint)
  - ends lost (bigint)
  - blank ends (bigint)
  - stolen ends (bigint)
  - shot pct (text)

Evidence and verification
1) Minimum blank ends where w = 6 (SQL executed):
   SELECT MIN("blank ends") AS min_blank_ends 
   FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier 
   WHERE w = 6;
   Result: min_blank_ends = 10

2) Teams with w = 6 and their blank ends (SQL executed):
   SELECT locale, skip, "blank ends" 
   FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier 
   WHERE w = 6 
   ORDER BY "blank ends" ASC;
   Results (sorted by blank ends):
   - Ontario | Wayne Middaugh | 10
   - Saskatchewan | Pat Simmons | 12
   - Newfoundland and Labrador | Brad Gushue | 13
   - British Columbia | Deane Horning | 18

Conclusion
- The minimum “blank ends” among teams with w = 6 is 10. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “blank end” refers to the column named “blank ends” in the dataset.
- “win (w) be 6” refers to rows where the column w equals 6.
- “lowest value” means the minimum across all applicable rows in the table.
