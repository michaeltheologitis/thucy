Claim interpreted: The shortest-time match was a win against Joe Campanella.

What I checked
- Identified all recorded fights and their times in the dataset.
- Computed the shortest-duration fight by ordering first by round ascending, then time within the round (parsed mm:ss) ascending.
- Cross-checked by ordering solely by parsed time to ensure the same fight appears as the minimum.

Evidence from the database
1) Full fight listing for context
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, method, event, round, time FROM public.tim_lajcik;
Key rows visible in the result include:
- win | joe campanella | tko | ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7 | 1 | 0:18
Other times in the table are larger (e.g., 1:20, 1:34, 1:55, 2:23, 3:23, 4:38, 5:36, 6:58, 9:49, and 5:00 in rounds 2–3), so 0:18 is the smallest by inspection.

2) Shortest fight by (round ASC, time ASC)
Result returned:
- res: win; opponent: joe campanella; event: ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7; round: 1; time: 0:18 (18 seconds)
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, time,
       (CAST(SPLIT_PART(time, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 +
        CAST(SPLIT_PART(time, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS time_in_seconds
FROM tim_lajcik
ORDER BY round ASC, time_in_seconds ASC
LIMIT 1;

3) Cross-check: shortest by parsed time only
Result returned:
- res: win; opponent: joe campanella; event: ifc wc 7 - warriors challenge 7; round: 1; time: 0:18; parsed_seconds: 18
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, time, 
(CAST(SPLIT_PART(time, ':', 1) AS INTEGER) * 60 + 
CAST(SPLIT_PART(time, ':', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS parsed_seconds 
FROM tim_lajcik 
ORDER BY parsed_seconds ASC 
LIMIT 1;

4) Direct lookup of the opponent for confirmation
Result returned:
- res: win; opponent: Joe Campanella; event: IFC WC 7 - Warriors Challenge 7; round: 1; time: 0:18; method: TKO
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, time, method FROM public.tim_lajcik WHERE opponent ILIKE '%campanella%';

Conclusion
- The shortest-time fight on record is a win against Joe Campanella at 0:18 of Round 1 (IFC WC 7 - Warriors Challenge 7). This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- "Shortest time" is interpreted as the minimal elapsed match duration; operationalized by ordering by (round, time within round). A cross-check ordering by time alone yields the same result and does not change the conclusion.
