Claim to verify: "the Utah Jazz have 3 player from the United States"

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database, schema public, table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (players’ names, nationality, position, years for Jazz, school/club team).

Step 1: Confirm table structure and sample data
- SQL (columns):
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 'utah_jazz_all_time_roster';
- Result (abridged): player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)

- SQL (sample rows):
  SELECT * 
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  LIMIT 5;
- Sample result (abridged): includes rows like Rick Adelman — United States — Guard; John Amaechi — England — Center/Forward; Louis Amundson — United States — Forward; etc.

Step 2: Identify how “United States” is stored
- SQL (distinct nationality values containing 'united'):
  SELECT DISTINCT nationality FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE LOWER(nationality) LIKE '%united%';
- Result: United States

Step 3: Count players from the United States
- SQL (distinct players, case-insensitive match):
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS distinct_players_count 
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE nationality ILIKE 'united states';
- Result: 6 distinct players

- SQL (total rows, case-insensitive match):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows_count 
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE nationality ILIKE 'united states';
- Result: 6 rows

Step 4: List those players
- SQL:
  SELECT player, position 
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE nationality ILIKE 'united states' 
  ORDER BY player;
- Result: anthony avent — Forward; isaac austin — Center; j j anderson — Forward; louis amundson — Forward; rick adelman — Guard; shandon anderson — Guard/Forward.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available roster table, there are 6 players listed with nationality “United States,” not 3. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes:
- Ambiguity: The claim does not specify a season. The available dataset is an all-time roster table for the Utah Jazz (and appears to include entries primarily from early alphabetized player names); conclusions are drawn strictly from this dataset. If the claim intended the current season roster, that is not represented in the available data source. Case variations in nationality values were handled using case-insensitive matching (ILIKE).
