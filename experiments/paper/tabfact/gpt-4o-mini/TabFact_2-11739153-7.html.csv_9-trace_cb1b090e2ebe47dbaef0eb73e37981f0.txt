Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data available for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season games in this dataset. Backstrom is credited with the decision more times than Harding.

Key evidence from the database
- Data source discovered: public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season (authoritative within scope provided).
- Schema (relevant fields): date (text), visitor (text), home (text), score (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

1) Inspect decision values
SQL:
SELECT decision FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt: backstrom, backstrom, backstrom, backstrom, harding, harding, backstrom, backstrom, backstrom, harding (indicating the decision field holds goalie names for Minnesota’s goalie of record).

2) Count decisions by goalie (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT LOWER(decision) AS goalie, COUNT(*) AS cnt 
FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season 
GROUP BY LOWER(decision) 
ORDER BY cnt DESC;
Results:
- backstrom: 11
- harding: 3
Interpretation: Backstrom had 11 recorded decisions; Harding had 3.

3) Total games represented in this dataset
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
Result: 14

4) Context check: example rows
SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, home, score, decision, record FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 14;
Result summary (February games): decisions alternate between Backstrom and Harding; tally aligns with counts above (Backstrom 11, Harding 3).

Assessment
- The claim states that during the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season, the decision was Harding more times than Backstrom. In the available dataset (14 games), Backstrom is credited with the decision 11 times versus Harding 3 times. This contradicts the claim.

Assumptions
- “Decision” refers to the Minnesota Wild goaltender of record for each game (win/loss credited), consistent with the values being Backstrom and Harding.
- “Harding” refers to Josh Harding; “Backstrom” refers to Niklas Bäckström.
- The table represents a subset of 2007–08 season games (14 games). Conclusions are drawn strictly from the provided data, treated as accurate and authoritative within its scope.
