Claim to verify: “spiral galaxy have the second highest declination ( j2000 ) in the list.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Relevant table: public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
- Table columns (as reported):
  - ngc number (bigint)
  - object type (text)
  - constellation (text)
  - right ascension ( j2000 ) (text)
  - declination ( j2000 ) (text)
  - apparent magnitude (double precision)

What “the list” is assumed to mean
- The only available list in this environment is the table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000. I interpret “the list” as this table.

Key task
- Identify which object has the second-highest declination (J2000) and check whether it is a spiral galaxy.

Data preparation and approach
- The declination values in this dataset appear as text strings like “degree39′45″”, which I interpret as 0°39′45″ (i.e., the word “degree” appears where a degree value would normally be). To rank declinations consistently across the rows, I parse minutes and seconds and convert to decimal degrees as: dec_deg = minutes/60 + seconds/3600. While this representation is non-standard, it is applied consistently to all rows, so relative ordering is preserved for this dataset.

Evidence 1: Top 5 highest declinations (parsed and ranked)
SQL executed:
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "declination ( j2000 )",
       (
         CAST(substring("declination ( j2000 )" from 'degree([0-9]+)′') AS double precision) / 60.0 +
         CAST(substring("declination ( j2000 )" from '′([0-9]+)″') AS double precision) / 3600.0
       ) AS dec_deg
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
WHERE "declination ( j2000 )" ~ 'degree[0-9]+′[0-9]+″'
ORDER BY dec_deg DESC
LIMIT 5;

Result (as returned):
1) NGC 5474 — Spiral Galaxy — declination: degree39′45″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.6625
2) NGC 5466 — Globular Cluster — declination: degree32′04″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.5344
3) NGC 5477 — Irregular Galaxy — declination: degree27′40″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.4611
4) NGC 5408 — Irregular Galaxy — declination: degree22′44″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.3789
5) NGC 5457 — Spiral Galaxy — declination: degree20′53″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.3481

Observation: The second-highest declination corresponds to NGC 5466, which is a Globular Cluster, not a Spiral Galaxy.

Evidence 2: Directly selecting the second-highest entry
SQL executed:
WITH parsed AS (
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "declination ( j2000 )",
         (
           CAST(substring("declination ( j2000 )" from 'degree([0-9]+)′') AS double precision) / 60.0 +
           CAST(substring("declination ( j2000 )" from '′([0-9]+)″') AS double precision) / 3600.0
         ) AS dec_deg
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
)
SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "declination ( j2000 )", dec_deg
FROM (
  SELECT p.*, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY dec_deg DESC) AS rn
  FROM parsed p
) t
WHERE rn = 2;

Result (as returned):
- NGC 5466 — object type: Globular Cluster — declination: degree32′04″ — dec_deg ≈ 0.5344

Conclusion
- The statement that a “spiral galaxy” has the second-highest declination (J2000) in the list is contradicted by the data. The second-highest declination is a Globular Cluster (NGC 5466). A Spiral Galaxy (NGC 5474) holds the highest, not the second-highest, position in this dataset.

Assumptions made
- “The list” refers to the available table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.
- The declination column, formatted as text like “degreeMM′SS″”, is interpreted uniformly as 0°MM′SS″ for ranking purposes. This maintains consistent relative ordering within this dataset.
- All rows in the table are included in the ranking; nulls (if any) are implicitly placed last by the ordering.
