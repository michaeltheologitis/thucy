Summary
I verified the claim against the available FA Cup 1990–91 match results data. I searched for matches where the away team name matches “Bolton Wanderer(s)” and checked the recorded score.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL public schema containing table: t_1990_91_fa_cup
  - Columns: tie no (text), home team (text), score (text), away team (text), date (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Case-insensitive search specifically for away team starting with “bolton wanderer”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE "away team" ILIKE 'bolton wanderer%';
- Result:
  - Home Team: Manchester United; Score: 1 - 0; Away Team: Bolton Wanderers; Date: 26 / 01 / 1991

2) Broader case-insensitive check (sanity check) for any team fields containing “bolton”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" 
FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup 
WHERE "home team" ILIKE '%bolton%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%bolton%';
- Result:
  - Home Team: Manchester United; Score: 1 - 0; Away Team: Bolton Wanderers; Date: 26 / 01 / 1991

Conclusion
Within the FA Cup 1990–91 dataset, there is a match where the away team is Bolton Wanderers and the final score is 1 - 0 (Manchester United 1 - 0 Bolton Wanderers). This supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions
- “bolton wanderer” refers to the club Bolton Wanderers (allowing for singular/plural and case differences).
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available data (FA Cup 1990–91) and refers to the full-time score.
