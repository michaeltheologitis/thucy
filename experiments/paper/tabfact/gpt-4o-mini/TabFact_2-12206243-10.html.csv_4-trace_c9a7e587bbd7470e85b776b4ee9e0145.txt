Claim to verify: "september 25 game be against the oriole the final score be 4 - 3 , 28324 fan be in attendance"

Summary conclusion: The data for the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays shows that on September 25 they played the Orioles, the final score was 4 - 3, and attendance was 28,324. This matches the claim exactly (28324).

Evidence from the database

1) Identify available tables
- SQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result: t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season

2) Inspect table columns
- SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season';
- Result (relevant columns):
  - attendance (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - score (text)

3) Retrieve the September 25 game details
- SQL: SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE TRIM(LOWER(date)) = LOWER('September 25');
- Result: date = "September 25", opponent = "orioles", score = "4 - 3", attendance = 28324

Assessment of each claim element
- Opponent: "orioles" — Supported by the row for September 25.
- Final score: "4 - 3" — Supported by the row for September 25.
- Attendance: "28324" — Supported (attendance is 28,324).

Assumptions
- The only available dataset pertains to the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays. I interpret the claim as referring to the Blue Jays’ game on September 25, 1997.
