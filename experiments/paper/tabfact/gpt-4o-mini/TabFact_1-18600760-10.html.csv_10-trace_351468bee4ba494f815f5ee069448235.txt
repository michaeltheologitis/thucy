Data source checked: TabFact PostgreSQL database, schema public, table list_of_townships_in_north_dakota (columns include: township, county, pop (2010), land ( sqmi ), water (sqmi), latitude, longitude, geo id, ansi code).

Verification steps and evidence:

1) Identify the township(s) with the absolute minimum land (sqmi)
SQL executed:
SELECT township, "land ( sqmi )" 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE "land ( sqmi )" = (SELECT MIN("land ( sqmi )") FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota);
Result:
- Township: James River Valley, Land (sqmi): 28.597

2) Retrieve the land area for the township named "james hill"
SQL executed:
SELECT township, "land ( sqmi )" 
FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota 
WHERE LOWER(township) LIKE LOWER('%james hill%');
Result:
- Township: james hill, Land (sqmi): 31.820

3) Quantify how many townships are smaller than “james hill” by land area
SQL executed:
SELECT "land ( sqmi )" FROM list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE township = 'james hill';
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE "land ( sqmi )" < 31.82;
Result:
- Land area of 'james hill': 31.82 sqmi
- Count of townships with land area smaller than 31.82 sqmi: 1 (namely, James River Valley at 28.597 sqmi)

Conclusion:
The township with the least land area in the dataset is James River Valley (28.597 sqmi). The township “james hill” has 31.820 sqmi, which is larger. Therefore, the claim that “james hill have the least amount of land (sqmi)” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “james hill” as the township name within the North Dakota townships dataset.
- Interpreted “least amount of land (sqmi)” as the minimum value of the column "land ( sqmi )" across all townships in the referenced table.
