Claim to verify: “After 2000, only Brazil and England contribute 1 player to the Utah Jazz.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster

Schema overview
- Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text)
- No explicit primary key

Evidence collected
1) Sample of data to understand year formatting
SQL executed:
SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster LIMIT 20;
Observed examples include formats like “2001 - 03”, “2006 - 2007”, and single years like “2007”.

2) List of players with tenure years that include “20” (quick scan of 2000s/2010s formatting)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT player, nationality, "years for jazz" 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE "years for jazz" LIKE '%20%' 
ORDER BY nationality, player;
Result (summarized):
- Rafael Araãjo — Brazil — 2006 - 2007
- John Amaechi — England — 2001 - 03
- Carlos Arroyo — Puerto Rico — 2002 - 05
- Louis Amundson — United States — 2007

3) Count of distinct players per nationality with any year strictly after 2000 (2001–2099)
SQL executed:
SELECT nationality, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count 
FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
WHERE "years for jazz" LIKE '%2001%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2002%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2003%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2004%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2005%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2006%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2007%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2008%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2009%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2010%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2011%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2012%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2013%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2014%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2015%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2016%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2017%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2018%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2019%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2020%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2021%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2022%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2023%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2024%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2025%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2026%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2027%' 
OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2028%' OR "years for jazz" LIKE '%2029%' 
GROUP BY nationality;
Result:
- Brazil: 1
- England: 1
- Puerto Rico: 1
- United States: 1

4) Nationalities that have exactly 1 distinct player in the after-2000 set (confirmation)

GROUP BY nationality
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT player) = 1;
Resulting nationalities: Brazil, England, Puerto Rico, United States

Conclusion
- The data show four nationalities each contributing exactly one player after 2000: Brazil, England, Puerto Rico, and the United States. Therefore, the statement that “only Brazil and England” contributed one player after 2000 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “after 2000” as any Jazz tenure including a year 2001 or later, identified via the presence of a four-digit year beginning with “20”.
- “Contribute 1 player” interpreted as exactly one distinct player from a nationality appearing with any 2001+ year in the “years for jazz” field.
- Relied on the provided roster table as authoritative for nationality and tenure years.
