Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2008_pga_championship (columns: place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text)

Step 1: Inspect sample rows to understand standings
Executed SQL:
SELECT place, player, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship LIMIT 20;
Result highlights:
- 1 | ben curtis | 73 + 67 + 68 = 208 | - 2
- t2 | j b holmes | 71 + 68 + 70 = 209 | - 1
- t2 | henrik stenson | 71 + 70 + 68 = 209 | - 1
- t4 | sergio garcía | 69 + 73 + 69 = 211 | + 1
- t4 | pádraig harrington | 71 + 74 + 66 = 211 | + 1
- t4 | charlie wi | 70 + 70 + 71 = 211 | + 1

Step 2: Retrieve rows for the three named players
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player IN ('sergio garcía', 'pádraig harrington', 'charlie wi');
Result:
- sergio garcía | place: t4 | to par: + 1
- pádraig harrington | place: t4 | to par: + 1
- charlie wi | place: t4 | to par: + 1

Step 3: Check who is at -1 to par
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, place FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE "to par" = '- 1';
Result:
- j b holmes | place: t2
- henrik stenson | place: t2

Step 4: Confirm if any t3 exists
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE place = 't3';
Result: No rows

Findings:
- According to the table, Sergio García, Pádraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi are tied for fourth place (t4) at +1 to par.
- Players at -1 to par are J.B. Holmes and Henrik Stenson, tied for second (t2).
- There is no tie for third (no t3 entries) in this dataset snapshot.

Conclusion:
- The claim that Sergio García, Pádraig Harrington, and Charlie Wi tie for third place with -1 to par is contradicted by the data. They are tied for fourth at +1 to par, not tied for third at -1.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the standings represented in the available table t_2008_pga_championship (which appears to be the 2008 PGA Championship leaderboard at the point captured by this dataset). No other tournaments or rounds were available in the data.
