Claim interpreted: The user asks whether Wes Roberts and Ed Whitley were both picked in the 3rd round (for the Indianapolis Colts, based on the available data source).

Findings from the Indianapolis Colts draft history database:
- Wes Roberts: Drafted in Round 7 (not Round 3)
- Ed Whitley: Drafted in Round 11 (not Round 3)

Executed SQL and results:
1) Query for Wes Roberts
SQL: SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Wes Roberts%';
Result: name='Wes Roberts', round=7, pick=5, overall=170, position='Defensive End', college='TCU'

2) Broader query for any name containing 'Wes'
SQL: SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Wes%';
Result: name='Wes Roberts', round=7, pick=5, overall=170, position='Defensive End', college='TCU'

3) Query for Ed Whitley
SQL: SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Ed Whitley%';
Result: name='Ed Whitley', round=11, pick=3, overall=280, position='Tight End', college='Kansas State'

4) Broader query for any name containing 'Whitley'
SQL: SELECT round, pick, overall, name, position, college FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history WHERE name ILIKE '%Whitley%';
Result: name='Ed Whitley', round=11, pick=3, overall=280, position='Tight End', college='Kansas State'

Conclusion: According to the verified Colts draft-history data, neither Wes Roberts nor Ed Whitley was selected in the 3rd round. Wes Roberts was a 7th-round pick and Ed Whitley was an 11th-round pick.

Assumptions: The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset (Indianapolis Colts draft history) and the names refer to the exact player entries matching 'Wes Roberts' and 'Ed Whitley' in that dataset.
