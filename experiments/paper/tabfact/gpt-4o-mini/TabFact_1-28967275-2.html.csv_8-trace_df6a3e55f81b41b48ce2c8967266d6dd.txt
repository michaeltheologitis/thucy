Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the production code for the episode in series 9 is 208.0.

Data source exploration:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table
- Columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Evidence collected:
1) Retrieve all episodes in series 9
SQL:
SELECT episode, "episode title", "production code" FROM my_info_table WHERE series = 9;
Result:
- Episode: 35, Episode Title: the all - stars, Production Code: 209

2) Count rows in series 9 and list distinct production codes
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM my_info_table WHERE series = 9;
Result: 1

SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "production code" FROM my_info_table WHERE series = 9;
Result: 209

3) Check if any episode has production code 208 (or 208.0) and which series it belongs to
SQL:
SELECT series, episode, "episode title" 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE "production code" = 208 OR "production code" = 208.0;
Result:
- Series: 8, Episode: 34, Title: rocket 's decent

Conclusion:
- The only episode in series 9 has production code 209, not 208.0. Production code 208 belongs to an episode in series 8.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as stating that the production code for the episode in series 9 equals 208.0. Minor formatting (208 vs 208.0) is treated as the same numeric value.
