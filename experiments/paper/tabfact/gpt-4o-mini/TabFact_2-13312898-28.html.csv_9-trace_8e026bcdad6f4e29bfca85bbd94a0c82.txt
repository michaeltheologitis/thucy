Claim to verify: “Curtis Dickey and Randy Bielski were picked in round 2.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered an available relational data source: Database “TabFact” with draft-history data for the Indianapolis/Baltimore Colts franchise. I queried the public NFL draft history table for evidence on the two named players.

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Player lookup for both names in the Colts draft history
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, overall, round, pick, college 
FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history 
WHERE name ILIKE 'Curtis Dickey' OR name ILIKE 'Randy Bielski';
Finding: 
- Curtis Dickey appears as a Round 1 selection, overall pick 5 (Running Back; college Texas A&M).
- Randy Bielski appears as a Round 12 selection, overall pick 311.

2) Targeted confirmation for Curtis Dickey’s draft round and pick
Executed SQL:
SELECT college, name, round AS draft_round, pick AS overall_pick 
FROM public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history 
WHERE LOWER(name) = 'curtis dickey';
Finding:
- Confirms Curtis Dickey’s draft round as Round 1 (overall pick 5), not Round 2.

Conclusion
- Curtis Dickey: Drafted Round 1 (overall 5), not Round 2.
- Randy Bielski: Drafted Round 12 (overall 311), not Round 2.
Therefore, the claim that both were picked in round 2 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The franchise draft history table for the Colts covers their history as both Baltimore Colts and Indianapolis Colts, which is standard for franchise-level draft records.
- Player matching is based on exact name matches provided in the data source (case-insensitive).
