Conclusion: The available data does not support that milepost 12.8 is at Weymouth. In the Massachusetts Route 139 dataset, milepost 12.8 is recorded in Rockland (Plymouth County), and the only row for Weymouth contains no numeric milepost information.

Data sources explored:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: massachusetts_route_139 (columns: county text, location text, street names text, milepost text, roads intersected text, notes text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Searched for any Weymouth entries with a milepost near 12.8
- Executed SQL:
SELECT location, milepost FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location ILIKE '%Weymouth%' AND (milepost::numeric BETWEEN 12.5 AND 13.1);
- Result: No rows returned.

2) Located any entries explicitly containing milepost 12.8
- Executed SQL:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost 
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 
WHERE milepost LIKE '%12.8%';
- Result: county = Plymouth; location = Rockland; street names = North Avenue, Plain Street, Market Street; milepost = 12.8

3) Listed all entries for Weymouth to check available milepost data
- Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 WHERE location = 'Weymouth' OR location ILIKE '%Weymouth%';
- Result: county = norfolk; location = weymouth; street names = anne street; milepost = (no major junctions); roads intersected = (no major junctions); notes = (no major junctions)

Assessment:
- Milepost 12.8 appears in Rockland, not Weymouth, in this dataset. No evidence in the data places milepost 12.8 at Weymouth.

Assumptions made:
- The claim pertains to Massachusetts Route 139 and uses the “milepost” field from the public.massachusetts_route_139 table as the authoritative source for milepost locations.
