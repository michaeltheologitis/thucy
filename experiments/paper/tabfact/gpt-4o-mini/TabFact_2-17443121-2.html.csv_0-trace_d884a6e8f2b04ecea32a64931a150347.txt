Claim: In season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the most viewed episode of the season is titled “Gary and Allison Brook.”

Findings grounded in data:
- The table public.gary_unmarried lists 20 episodes airing between September 2008 and May 2009, which aligns with Season 1’s run. It contains episode titles and total viewers (in millions).
- Querying the table shows the highest-viewed episode has 8.14 million viewers and its title is “gary and allison brooks.” This is the unique maximum in the dataset.
- The user’s title has a small discrepancy (“Brook” vs. “Brooks”), but the substance of the claim (that this episode is the most viewed in Season 1) is supported by the data.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) To list all episodes and their viewers (ordered by air date):
SELECT episode, "air date", timeslot, "18 - 49", viewers 
FROM public.gary_unmarried 
ORDER BY "air date" ASC;

2) To identify the episode(s) with the maximum number of viewers:
SELECT episode, "air date", viewers 
FROM public.gary_unmarried 
WHERE viewers = (SELECT MAX(viewers) FROM public.gary_unmarried);

Key result from (2):
- Episode: gary and allison brooks; Air Date: November 19, 2008; Viewers: 8.14 million

Conclusion:
- The dataset shows “gary and allison brooks” is the most viewed episode in the set corresponding to Season 1. The claim is correct except for a minor title typo (“Brook” vs. “Brooks”).

Assumptions:
- The public.gary_unmarried table represents all Season 1 episodes (20 entries) of Gary Unmarried, as indicated by the air dates (2008–2009) and typical season length.
