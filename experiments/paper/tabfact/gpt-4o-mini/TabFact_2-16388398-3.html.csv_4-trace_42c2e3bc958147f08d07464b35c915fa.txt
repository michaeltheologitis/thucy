Claim interpreted: "Melbourne be the home team when the team meet at Adelaide." I interpret this as asking whether Melbourne were designated the home team in a match played in Adelaide (i.e., at an Adelaide venue) within the available dataset.

Data source explored:
- Database: default (public schema)
- Table: public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup
- Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), ground (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence from data:
1) Find Melbourne fixtures in Adelaide
SQL executed:
SELECT date, ground, "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score" 
FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup 
WHERE (ground ILIKE '%Adelaide%' OR ground ILIKE '%Football Park%' OR ground ILIKE '%AAMI%') 
AND ("home team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%')

Result:
- Date: Sunday, 30 January 2000
- Ground: Football Park
- Home Team: Adelaide
- Away Team: Melbourne
- Home Team Score: 17.5 (107)
- Away Team Score: 19.11 (125)

2) Confirm count and distinct grounds
SQL executed (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count 
FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup 
WHERE (ground ILIKE '%Adelaide%' OR ground ILIKE '%Football Park%' OR ground ILIKE '%AAMI%') 
AND ("home team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%')
Result: 1 match

SQL executed (distinct grounds):
SELECT DISTINCT ground 
FROM public.t_2000_ansett_australia_cup 
WHERE (ground ILIKE '%Adelaide%' OR ground ILIKE '%Football Park%' OR ground ILIKE '%AAMI%') 
AND ("home team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%' OR "away team" ILIKE '%Melbourne%')
Result: Football Park

Conclusion:
In the available dataset (2000 Ansett Australia Cup), the match involving Melbourne that was played in Adelaide (Football Park) lists Adelaide as the home team and Melbourne as the away team. Therefore, Melbourne was not the home team when they met at Adelaide in this dataset.

Assumptions:
- "Adelaide" refers to matches played in Adelaide venues (e.g., Football Park/AAMI Stadium/Adelaide Oval). The dataset only covers the 2000 Ansett Australia Cup; results outside this scope are not considered here.
