Claim interpreted: The user is asking whether there is a township named Jackson located in Mountrail County (North Dakota).

Data source explored: public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota
- Key columns: township (text), county (text), plus population, area, coordinates, and IDs.

Evidence collected:
1) Direct check for a Jackson township in Mountrail County
- Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county ILIKE 'Mountrail' AND township ILIKE 'Jackson%';
- Result: No rows returned (no such township found in Mountrail County).

2) Count of such matches
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE county ILIKE 'Mountrail' AND township ILIKE 'Jackson%';
- Result: 0

3) Check where Jackson-named township(s) exist statewide
- Executed SQL: SELECT township, county FROM public.list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE LOWER(township) LIKE 'jackson%';
- Result: Jackson | Sargent (indicates a Jackson township exists in Sargent County, not Mountrail County).

4) List the township names recorded for Mountrail County (for context)
- Executed SQL: SELECT township FROM list_of_townships_in_north_dakota WHERE LOWER(county) = LOWER('Mountrail') ORDER BY township;
- Result: James Hill (no Jackson listed under Mountrail County in this dataset).

Conclusion: The dataset shows no Jackson township in Mountrail County. It shows a Jackson township in Sargent County. Therefore, the claim that Jackson township is in Mountrail County is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- The term “township” refers to civil townships as listed in the provided table for North Dakota.
- Spelling and naming are matched case-insensitively and include names beginning with “Jackson” (e.g., Jackson, Jackson No. X) to account for common variants.
