Summary
- Claim: “the lowest right ascension (RA) be ngc 1533 with a right ascension of 4 hour 9 minute and 51.8 second.”
- Finding: In the available dataset (public.dorado_group), ngc 1533 does have RA = 04h09 m51.8s, but it is NOT the lowest RA. The lowest RA belongs to ngc 1515 with RA = 04h04 m02.7s.

Data source discovery
- Available data source discovered: PostgreSQL schema public with table dorado_group (objects in the Dorado Group, including NGC identifiers). Relevant columns include name (text) and "ra ( j2000 )" (text).

Evidence
1) Confirm ngc 1533’s RA
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )" FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 1533';
Result:
- name: ngc 1533
- ra ( j2000 ): 04h09 m51.8s

2) Identify the object with the lowest RA (by parsing RA to decimal hours)
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )",
  (EXTRACT(HOUR FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("ra ( j2000 )", 'HH24hMI mSS.s')) +
   EXTRACT(MINUTE FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("ra ( j2000 )", 'HH24hMI mSS.s')) / 60 +
   EXTRACT(SECOND FROM TO_TIMESTAMP("ra ( j2000 )", 'HH24hMI mSS.s')) / 3600) AS decimal_hours
FROM public.dorado_group
ORDER BY decimal_hours ASC
LIMIT 1;
Result:
- name: ngc 1515
- ra ( j2000 ): 04h04 m02.7s
- decimal_hours: ≈ 4.0672

3) Confirm ngc 1515’s RA
SQL executed:
SELECT name, "ra ( j2000 )" FROM dorado_group WHERE name = 'ngc 1515';
Result:
- name: ngc 1515
- ra ( j2000 ): 04h04 m02.7s

Assessment of the claim
- “ngc 1533 has RA 4h 9m 51.8s” — Supported by Evidence 1.
- “ngc 1533 has the lowest RA” — Contradicted by Evidence 2 and 3 (ngc 1515 has lower RA: 04h04 m02.7s).

Conclusion
- The dataset shows ngc 1533’s RA value is correct, but it is not the lowest RA; ngc 1515 is lower.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated against the available, authoritative dataset public.dorado_group (Dorado Group objects). No external catalogs were used.
- RA parsing uses the provided text format 'HHhMI mSS.s' via TO_TIMESTAMP to compute decimal hours for ordering.
