Claim (interpreted): In the 5th Seanad Éireann data, the National University of Ireland (NUI) is the only origin group that is “mostly” made up of members from two parties.

Data environment discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.members_of_the_5th_seanad with columns: party, “administrative panel”, “agricultural panel”, “cultural and educational panel”, “industrial and commercial panel”, “labour panel”, “national university of ireland”, “university of dublin”, “nominated by the taoiseach”, total.

Evidence queries and results
1) Full table (party-by-origin seat counts)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result excerpt returned by the tool (key figures relevant to analysis):
- National University of Ireland: Fianna Fáil 1, Fine Gael 1, Independent 1, others 0; Total (column total) = 3
- Administrative panel: Fianna Fáil 4, Fine Gael 1; Total = 7
- Agricultural panel: Fianna Fáil 4, Fine Gael 3, Clann na Talmhan 2, Independent 1; Total = 11
- Cultural and educational panel: Fianna Fáil 2, Fine Gael 2; Total = 5
- Industrial and commercial panel: Fianna Fáil 3, Fine Gael 2, Labour 1, Independent 1; Total = 9
- University of Dublin: Independent 3; Total = 3
- Labour panel: Labour 5, Clann na Talmhan 1; Total = 11
- Nominated by the Taoiseach: Fianna Fáil 7, Labour Party 2 (note: other outputs below add Independent 3); Total = 11

2) National University of Ireland breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "national university of ireland" AS seats 
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad 
ORDER BY seats DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 3; Fianna Fáil: 1; Fine Gael: 1; Independent: 1; Labour Party: 0; Clann na Talmhan: 0.
Top two parties (by seats): any two of {Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independent} = 2 of 3 = 66.7%.

3) Administrative panel breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "administrative panel" AS seat_count 
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad 
ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 7; Fianna Fáil: 4; Fine Gael: 1; others: 0.
Top two parties (Fianna Fáil + Fine Gael) = 4 + 1 = 5 of 7 = 71.4%.

4) Agricultural panel breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "agricultural panel" AS seat_count 
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad 
ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 11; Fianna Fáil: 4; Fine Gael: 3; Clann na Talmhan: 2; Independent: 1; Labour Party: 0.
Top two parties (Fianna Fáil + Fine Gael) = 7 of 11 = 63.6%.

5) Cultural and educational panel breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "cultural and educational panel" AS seat_count 
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 5; Fianna Fáil: 2; Fine Gael: 2; others shown: 0.
Top two parties (Fianna Fáil + Fine Gael) = 4 of 5 = 80%.

6) Industrial and commercial panel breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "industrial and commercial panel" AS seats 
FROM public.members_of_the_5th_seanad 
ORDER BY seats DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 9; Fianna Fáil: 3; Fine Gael: 2; Labour Party: 1; Independent: 1; Clann na Talmhan: 0.
Top two parties (Fianna Fáil + Fine Gael) = 5 of 9 = 55.6%.

7) University of Dublin breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "university of dublin" AS seat_count FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Independent: 3; Total: 3; others: 0.
Observation: A single grouping (Independents) holds 3/3 = 100%. By the “two-parties combined” notion, the top two also trivially sum to a majority here.

8) Labour panel breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "labour panel" AS seat_count FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 11; Labour Party: 5; Clann na Talmhan: 1; others shown: 0.
Top two shown (Labour + Clann na Talmhan) = 6 of 11 = 54.5%.

9) Nominated by the Taoiseach breakdown
SQL:
SELECT party, "nominated by the taoiseach" AS seat_count 
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad 
ORDER BY seat_count DESC;
Result (tool):
- Total: 11; Fianna Fáil: 7; Independent: 3; Labour Party: 2; Fine Gael: 0; Clann na Talmhan: 0.
Top two (Fianna Fáil + Independent) = 10 of 11 = 90.9% (note: there is some inconsistency across outputs for this column; however, in all cases the top two parties are a majority).

Analysis
- Interpreting “mostly of members from 2 party” as “the combined seats of the top two parties exceed 50% of the seats in that origin,” the data show that many origin groups meet this condition, not just NUI:
  - Administrative panel: 71.4% from top two (FF+FG) [Query 3]
  - Agricultural panel: 63.6% from top two (FF+FG) [Query 4]
  - Cultural and educational panel: 80% from top two (FF+FG) [Query 5]
  - Industrial and commercial panel: 55.6% from top two (FF+FG) [Query 6]
  - Labour panel: 54.5% from top two shown (Labour + Clann na Talmhan) [Query 8]
  - University of Dublin: 100% from one grouping (Independents), thus trivially a majority from top one/two [Query 7]
  - Nominated by the Taoiseach: at least a clear majority from top two [Query 9]
- For NUI, the top two parties account for 2 of 3 seats (66.7%) [Query 2]. But NUI is not unique in this regard; multiple other origin groups also have a majority of their seats held by the top two parties.
- If instead “mostly of members from 2 party” is interpreted as “composed primarily/exclusively of exactly two parties,” NUI also does not fit uniquely: NUI includes three categories (FF, FG, Independent). Other groups either include more than two parties or, in the case of University of Dublin, are entirely Independent (one category). Hence, under this stricter interpretation, NUI is not the only such group either.

Conclusion
Based on the party-by-origin seat distributions for the 5th Seanad, the National University of Ireland is not the only origin group where two parties comprise most of the seats. Several other origin groups have their seats mostly concentrated in two parties. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions due to ambiguity
- “Group of origin” refers to the origin columns in the table (the university constituencies and vocational panels, plus Taoiseach nominations) within the 5th Seanad.
- “Mostly of members from 2 party” is operationalized as “the top two parties by seats jointly hold more than 50% of that origin’s seats.” The alternative reading (“composed mainly/exclusively of exactly two parties present”) also fails to make NUI unique in this dataset.
- Minor inconsistencies in per-party breakdowns for some columns (e.g., ‘nominated by the taoiseach’) do not affect the central finding that many origins have a majority concentrated in two parties.
