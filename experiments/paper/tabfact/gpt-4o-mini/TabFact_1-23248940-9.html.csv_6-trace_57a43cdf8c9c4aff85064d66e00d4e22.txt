Claim to verify: “Stephen Jackson led the team in points for less than half the game.”

Interpretation: Using the available Charlotte Bobcats 2009–10 season data, interpret the claim as: “In the games represented by the available dataset, Stephen Jackson led the Bobcats in points in fewer than half of the games.” Leading is taken to include ties for team-high points.

Data discovery and structure
- Available data sources:
  - Confirmed a single relevant table in the public schema.
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

- Table and columns used:
  - Table: public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  - Columns (from information_schema.columns): game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text)
  - Executed SQL (columns):
    SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season';
  - Sample rows (to confirm semantics):
    Executed SQL (sample rows):
    SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season LIMIT 5;
  - Example sample records (abbreviated):
    • february 1 | game 47 | high points: raymond felton (23)
    • february 3 | game 48 | high points: stephen jackson (30)
    • february 6 | game 49 | high points: stephen jackson (26)
    • february 9 | game 50 | high points: stephen jackson (22)
    • february 10 | game 51 | high points: stephen jackson (33)

Evidence and calculations
- Total number of games in this dataset:
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
  - Result: 10 games

- Number of games where Stephen Jackson is the team’s high scorer (including ties):
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS jackson_games FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season WHERE LOWER("high points") LIKE '%stephen jackson%';
  - Result: 6 games

Assessment
- Proportion of games with Stephen Jackson as team high scorer: 6/10 = 60%.
- This is not “less than half”; it is more than half within this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the available data: Stephen Jackson led (or tied for the lead in) team points in 6 out of 10 games (60%), which is not less than half.

Assumptions
- The phrase “lead the team in point” is interpreted as “had (or tied for) the team’s highest point total in a game.”
- The claim is evaluated over the scope of the available dataset (10 Charlotte Bobcats games from the 2009–10 season contained in the table). The accessible data source is treated as authoritative within its scope.
- Case-insensitive matching on the text field "high points" was used to identify games led by Stephen Jackson, counting ties as leading.
