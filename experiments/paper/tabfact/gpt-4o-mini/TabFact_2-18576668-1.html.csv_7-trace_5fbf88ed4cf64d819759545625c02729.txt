Claim interpreted: The user asserts that seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 are in the limited format.

Data source discovery
- Available database: public schema with one table: tsuyoshi_fujita (columns: season, event type, location, format, date, rank).

Evidence
1) Distinct seasons and formats in the dataset (to understand available values)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season, format FROM tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY season;
Result excerpt relevant to the claim:
- 2001 - 02: team limited; standard; limited
- 2002 - 03: extended; standard; limited
- 2003 - 04: special; standard

2) Formats present specifically for the seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, 2003 - 04
SQL:
SELECT season, format FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04') GROUP BY season, format ORDER BY season;
Results:
- 2001 - 02: limited; standard; team limited
- 2002 - 03: extended; limited; standard
- 2003 - 04: special; standard

3) Count of rows where the format includes the word "limited" (case-insensitive) for the three seasons
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS limited_count
FROM tsuyoshi_fujita
WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04')
AND format ILIKE '%limited%';
Result:
- limited_count = 4 (across the three seasons)

4) Breakdown by season for formats that include "limited"
SQL:
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as count_of_rows 
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita 
WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04') 
AND LOWER(format) LIKE '%limited%' 
GROUP BY season;
Results:
- 2001 - 02: 3 rows
- 2002 - 03: 1 row
- 2003 - 04: 0 rows

Assessment of the claim
- 2001 - 02: Includes limited (and team limited) → supports claim
- 2002 - 03: Includes limited → supports claim
- 2003 - 04: No limited formats present (only special, standard) → contradicts claim

Conclusion: Two seasons (2001 - 02, 2002 - 03) meet the “limited format” criterion; one season (2003 - 04) does not. Therefore, the blanket claim that all three seasons are in the limited format is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Limited format” is interpreted as any record where the format equals "limited" or contains the word "limited" (e.g., "team limited"). This interpretation strengthens the claim; even under this inclusive definition, 2003 - 04 still lacks any limited entries.
