Summary of findings
- The data source contains a table public.wushu_at_the_asian_games with medal counts by nation for Wushu at the Asian Games.
- Comparison between Philippines and Macau:
  - Gold: Philippines 1 vs Macau 1 → Same
  - Silver: Philippines 5 vs Macau 5 → Same
  - Bronze: Philippines 8 vs Macau 4 → Macau does NOT have 4 more; Macau has 4 fewer than the Philippines

Conclusion
- The statement that both have the same number of gold and silver medals is supported.
- The statement that Macau has 4 more bronze medals is contradicted by the data; the opposite is true (Philippines has 4 more bronze medals than Macau).

Executed SQL and evidence
1) Schema discovery (tables and columns)
SQL:
SELECT table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result (relevant excerpt):
- Table: public.wushu_at_the_asian_games
  - Columns: gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint), rank (text), nation (text)

2) Medal counts for Philippines and Macau
SQL:
SELECT gold, silver, bronze, total, rank, nation 
FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Philippines%' OR nation ILIKE '%Macau%';
Results:
- philippines (phi): gold=1, silver=5, bronze=8, total=14, rank=7
- macau (mac): gold=1, silver=5, bronze=4, total=10, rank=8

3) Variant name check to ensure comprehensive matching
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, silver, bronze, total, rank 
FROM public.wushu_at_the_asian_games 
WHERE nation ILIKE '%Philippine%' OR 
      nation ILIKE '%Philippines%' OR 
      nation ILIKE '%Macau%' OR 
      nation ILIKE '%Macau, China%';
Results:
- philippines (phi): gold=1, silver=5, bronze=8, total=14, rank=7
- macau (mac): gold=1, silver=5, bronze=4, total=10, rank=8

Assumptions
- “the philippine” refers to the Philippines (NOC: PHI) and “macau” refers to Macau (NOC: MAC) as listed in the nation column.
- The table represents aggregate Wushu medal totals at the Asian Games by nation.
