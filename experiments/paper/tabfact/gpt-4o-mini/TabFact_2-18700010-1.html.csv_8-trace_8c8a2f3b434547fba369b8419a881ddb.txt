Claim to verify: “there be 2 player with the highest number of total goal ian robin and chris topping”

Summary of findings
- The dataset available is a single table for Huddersfield Town’s 1979–80 season: public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season. It contains player names and goals by competition, plus a total goals column.
- The maximum total goals scored by any player in this dataset is 27, and only one player achieved this: Ian Robins. Chris Topping scored 0 total goals.
- Therefore, there are not two joint top scorers; there is only one, and it is Ian Robins (not “Ian Robin”).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find the maximum total goals
SQL:
SELECT MAX("total goals") AS max_goals
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;
Result:
- max_goals = 27

2) List all players who have that maximum total goals
SQL:
SELECT name
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
WHERE "total goals" = (SELECT MAX("total goals") FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season);
Result:
- Ian Robins

3) Count/list confirmation of players at the maximum
SQL:
SELECT name, "total goals"
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
WHERE "total goals" = (
    SELECT MAX("total goals")
    FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
);
Result:
- 1 row: Ian Robins — total goals 27

4) Show all players and their total goals (independently computed from components) for context
SQL:
SELECT name, (COALESCE("league goals", 0) + COALESCE("fa cup goals", 0) + COALESCE("league cup goals", 0)) AS total_goals
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
ORDER BY total_goals DESC, name ASC;
Excerpt of results (top to lower):
- Ian Robins — 27
- Peter Fletcher — 18
- Steve Kindon — 14
- David Cowling — 10
- Brian Stanton — 9
- Dave Sutton — 7
- Peter Hart — 5
- Ian Holmes — 4
- Mick Laverick — 4
- Malcolm Brown — 3
- Keith Hanvey — 2
- Fred Robinson — 1
- Alan Starling — 0
- Andy Rankin — 0
- Bernard Purdie — 0
- Chris Topping — 0
- Jim Branagan — 0
- Tommy Smith — 0

5) Verify Chris Topping’s row directly (case/space-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals", "fa cup goals", "league cup goals", "total goals"
FROM public.t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
WHERE TRIM(LOWER(name)) = TRIM(LOWER('Chris Topping'));
Result:
- name: chris topping; league goals: 0; fa cup goals: 0; league cup goals: 0; total goals: 0

6) Verify Ian Robins’ row directly
SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals", "fa cup goals", "league cup goals", "total goals"
FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season
WHERE LOWER(name) = LOWER('Ian Robins');
Result:
- name: Ian Robins; league goals: 25; fa cup goals: 0; league cup goals: 2; total goals: 27

Conclusion
- The data shows only one top scorer by total goals (27): Ian Robins. Chris Topping scored 0. The claim that there are two joint top scorers, “ian robin and chris topping,” is contradicted by the data on hand.

Assumptions made
- “total goal” is interpreted as the “total goals” column in the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town FC season dataset (sum across all competitions in that season).
- The names are matched to dataset entries: “ian robin” interpreted as “Ian Robins,” and “chris topping” as “Chris Topping.”
