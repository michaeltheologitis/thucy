Claim interpreted: “Steve Gould be lead in Richmond” (i.e., Steve Gould is the lead associated with the Richmond entry in the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset).

What the data shows:
- Steve Gould is listed as the lead for Jeff Stoughton’s team, with the city recorded as Winnipeg.
- The entry for Richmond lists Aaron Watson as the lead (on Greg McAulay’s team), not Steve Gould.

Evidence (exact executed SQL and results):
1) List all entries
SQL:
SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials;
Result excerpt (relevant rows):
- Skip: Jeff Stoughton | Third / Vice Skip: Kevin Park | Second: Rob Fowler | Lead: Steve Gould | City: Winnipeg
- Skip: Greg McAulay | Third / Vice Skip: Ken Maskiewich | Second: Deane Horning | Lead: Aaron Watson | City: Richmond

2) Find any row where the lead contains “Gould”
SQL:
SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city 
FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials 
WHERE lead ILIKE '%Gould%';
Result:
- Skip: Jeff Stoughton | Third / Vice Skip: Kevin Park | Second: Rob Fowler | Lead: Steve Gould | City: Winnipeg

3) Find any row where the city contains “Richmond”
SQL:
SELECT skip, "third / vice skip", second, lead, city 
FROM public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials 
WHERE LOWER(city) LIKE '%richmond%';
Result:
- Skip: Greg McAulay | Third / Vice Skip: Ken Maskiewich | Second: Deane Horning | Lead: Aaron Watson | City: Richmond

Conclusion:
- True portion: Steve Gould is a lead (he is lead for Jeff Stoughton’s team).
- False portion: He is not the lead in the Richmond entry; Richmond’s lead is Aaron Watson.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 2009 Canadian Olympic Curling Trials dataset available (table: public.t_2009_canadian_olympic_curling_trials) and the “city” field indicating the team’s associated city in that dataset.
