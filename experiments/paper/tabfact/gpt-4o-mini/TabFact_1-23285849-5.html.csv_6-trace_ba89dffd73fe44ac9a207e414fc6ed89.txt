Claim interpreted: “The Nuggets lost all 6 games played at the Pepsi Center during this span.”

Data discovery and schema grounding:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, schema public, table t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season (2009-10 Denver Nuggets season).
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text; begins with W or L), location attendance (text; includes venue name, e.g., “Pepsi Center”), record (text).

Evidence 1: List the games at Pepsi Center and their results
- Result: 6 Pepsi Center games are recorded; each shows a win in the score field.
- SQL executed:
SELECT game, date, team, score, "location attendance", record
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Pepsi Center%'
ORDER BY game ASC;
- Returned rows (abridged from tool output):
  • Game 3 — Date: November 1 — Opponent: Grizzlies — Score: Won 133 - 123 (OT) — Attendance: 15,823 — Record: 3 - 0
  • Game 10 — Date: November 13 — Opponent: Lakers — Score: Won 105 - 79 (OT) — Attendance: 19,141 — Record: 7 - 3
  • Game 11 — Date: November 17 — Opponent: Raptors — Score: Won 130 - 112 (OT) — Attendance: 16,446 — Record: 8 - 3
  • Game 13 — Date: November 21 — Opponent: Bulls — Score: Won 112 - 93 (OT) — Attendance: 19,359 — Record: 9 - 4
  • Game 14 — Date: November 24 — Opponent: Nets — Score: Won 101 - 87 (OT) — Attendance: 16,307 — Record: 10 - 4
  • Game 16 — Date: November 27 — Opponent: Knicks — Score: Won 128 - 125 (OT) — Attendance: 19,155 — Record: 12 - 4

Evidence 2: Aggregate wins and losses at Pepsi Center (robustly parsing score)
- Result: Home wins = 6; Home losses = 0; Total home games = 6.
- SQL executed:
SELECT 
  SUM(CASE WHEN TRIM(score) ~ '^[Ww]' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_wins,
  SUM(CASE WHEN TRIM(score) ~ '^[Ll]' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_losses,
  COUNT(*) AS home_games
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Pepsi Center%';
- Output: home_wins = 6; home_losses = 0; home_games = 6.

Evidence 3: Explicit count of losses at Pepsi Center
- Result: 0 losses recorded at Pepsi Center in the dataset.
- SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS home_losses_at_pepsi
FROM public.t_2009_10_denver_nuggets_season
WHERE "location attendance" ILIKE '%Pepsi Center%'
  AND TRIM(score) ~ '^[Ll]';
- Output: home_losses_at_pepsi = 0.

Conclusion:
- Based on the available 2009-10 Denver Nuggets dataset, the Nuggets did not “lose all 6 games” at the Pepsi Center in the recorded span. Instead, they won all 6 recorded home games at the Pepsi Center. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made (due to ambiguous phrasing “this span”):
- Interpreted “this span” as the span covered by the provided dataset (the recorded portion of the 2009-10 season in the available table). If a different time span was intended, it is not present in the accessible data; conclusions are limited to the verified dataset.
