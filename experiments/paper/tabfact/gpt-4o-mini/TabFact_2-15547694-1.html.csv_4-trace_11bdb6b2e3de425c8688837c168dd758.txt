Claim: “industrial and commercial panel have 4 more member than cultural and educational panel.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: A PostgreSQL database with table public.members_of_the_5th_seanad.
- Schema inspection shows columns capturing counts of members by panel, including "industrial and commercial panel" and "cultural and educational panel" and a party column, plus a Total row aggregating counts across parties.

Relevant schema details (from schema exploration)
- Table: members_of_the_5th_seanad
- Columns (subset): party (text); "industrial and commercial panel" (bigint); "cultural and educational panel" (bigint); other panel columns; total (bigint).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Listing panel counts by party (includes the aggregate Total row):
SQL:
SELECT party, "industrial and commercial panel", "cultural and educational panel" FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad;
Result excerpt (key rows):
- ...
- Total | 9 | 5
Interpretation: The Total row indicates the overall panel seat counts in the 5th Seanad are 9 for the Industrial and Commercial panel and 5 for the Cultural and Educational panel. The difference is 9 - 5 = 4.

Conclusion
- The data shows Industrial and Commercial panel has 9 seats and Cultural and Educational panel has 5 seats. Difference = 4. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “members” as panel seats and the claim as referring to the 5th Seanad (the scope of the available dataset).
