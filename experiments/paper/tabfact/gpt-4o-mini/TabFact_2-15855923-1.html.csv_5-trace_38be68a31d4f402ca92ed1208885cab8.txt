Claim to verify: “the score of the 2010 world cup qualification be 2 - 1 and the venue be seoul, south korea.”

Data sources explored
- PostgreSQL sports/football database (public schema)
- Single table: public.kwak_tae_hwi with columns: date (text), venue (text), score (text), result (text), competition (text)

Step 1: Confirm the competition values present
- Purpose: Verify that “2010 world cup qualification” exists in the data.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT competition FROM kwak_tae_hwi;
- Evidence returned (subset): 2010 world cup qualification; friendly; 2014 world cup qualification; 2008 east asian cup
- Interpretation: The dataset includes records labeled “2010 world cup qualification.”

Step 2: Retrieve all 2010 World Cup qualification matches in Seoul
- Purpose: Check if any such match in Seoul had a score “2 - 1.”
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, venue, score, result 
  FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi 
  WHERE competition = '2010 world cup qualification' AND venue ILIKE '%Seoul%';
- Evidence returned:
  1) Date: February 2, 2008 | Venue: Seoul, South Korea | Score: 1 - 0 | Result: 4 - 0
  2) Date: October 15, 2008 | Venue: Seoul, South Korea | Score: 4 - 1 | Result: 4 - 1
- Interpretation: There are two 2010 WC qualification matches in Seoul in this dataset; neither has a score of 2 - 1.

Step 3: Retrieve all matches labeled 2010 World Cup qualification (any venue)
- Purpose: Confirm whether any 2 - 1 result exists for that competition at all in this dataset.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, venue, score, result FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE competition = '2010 world cup qualification';
- Evidence returned:
  1) Date: February 2, 2008 | Venue: Seoul, South Korea | Score: 1 - 0 | Result: 4 - 0
  2) Date: October 15, 2008 | Venue: Seoul, South Korea | Score: 4 - 1 | Result: 4 - 1
- Interpretation: Within this dataset, there are no 2 - 1 scores for the 2010 World Cup qualification.

Step 4: Directly test for a 2 - 1 score within the 2010 World Cup qualification label
- Purpose: Definitive check for the claimed score within the specific competition label.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, venue, score FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE competition = '2010 world cup qualification' AND score ILIKE '%2 - 1%';
- Evidence returned: No rows
- Interpretation: The dataset contains no instance where the competition is “2010 world cup qualification” and the score is 2 - 1.

Additional check (context only)
- Purpose: Ensure the dataset is capable of storing a “2 - 1” score even if not for 2010 qualifiers.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, venue, score, competition FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '2 - 1';
- Evidence returned: Date: June 8, 2012 | Venue: Doha, Qatar | Score: 2 - 1 | Competition: 2014 World Cup Qualification
- Interpretation: A 2 - 1 score exists in the dataset, but not for the 2010 World Cup qualification nor in Seoul.

Conclusion
- The available data shows that the matches labeled “2010 world cup qualification” played in Seoul, South Korea had scores 1 - 0 and 4 - 1. There are no records in this dataset of a 2 - 1 score for the 2010 World Cup qualification in Seoul. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions due to ambiguity
- Interpreted the claim as referring to a match recorded in the accessible dataset under the exact competition label “2010 world cup qualification.”
- Assumed “venue be seoul, south korea” matches entries where venue contains “Seoul, South Korea.”
- Treated the score column as the match scoreline relevant to the claim.
