Claim interpreted: Among players who finished over par, a majority are from the United States (based on the available dataset).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: t_1989_u_s_open_golf (1989 U.S. Open Golf tournament)
- Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint)

How “over par” was determined
- Observed "to par" values include: "+ 3", "+ 2", "+ 1", "- 1", "- 2", and "e" (even).
- Operational definition: over par = rows where "to par" LIKE '+%'.

Evidence 1: Distinct values of "to par"
Executed SQL:
SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
GROUP BY "to par"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result summary:
- + 3: 4 occurrences
- - 1: 3 occurrences
- + 1: 2 occurrences
- + 2: 1 occurrence
- - 2: 1 occurrence
- e: 1 occurrence

Evidence 2: Over-par players by country
Executed SQL:
SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count, COUNT(player) * 1.0 / SUM(COUNT(player)) OVER () AS share
FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE "to par" LIKE '+%'
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY player_count DESC;
Result summary:
- United States: 5 players (~71.4%)
- Japan: 1 player (~14.3%)
- Spain: 1 player (~14.3%)

Evidence 3: List of over-par players (names, countries, to-par)
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, country, "to par"
FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE "to par" LIKE '+%';
Result rows:
- Masashi Ozaki (Japan) — +1
- Scott Simpson (United States) — +1
- Peter Jacobsen (United States) — +2
- Paul Azinger (United States) — +3
- Hubert Green (United States) — +3
- Tom Kite (United States) — +3
- José María Olazábal (Spain) — +3

Evidence 4: Total over-par count and U.S. share (normalized country check)
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_over_par_players
FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE "to par" LIKE '+%';
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS us_over_par_players
FROM t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE "to par" LIKE '+%' AND LOWER(TRIM(country)) = 'united states';
Results:
- total_over_par_players: 7
- us_over_par_players: 5

Conclusion
- 5 of 7 over-par players are from the United States (~71.4%). This is a clear majority.
- The claim is supported by the data available for the 1989 U.S. Open tournament.

Assumptions
- “People who score over par” refers to players in this dataset with "to par" values starting with '+', i.e., finishing above par.
- “United state” is interpreted as “United States.”
- The claim is evaluated against the provided dataset (1989 U.S. Open), not across all tournaments or years.
