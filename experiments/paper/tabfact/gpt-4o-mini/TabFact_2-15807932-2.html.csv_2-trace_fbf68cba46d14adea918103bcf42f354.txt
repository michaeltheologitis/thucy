Summary
- Claim: “there be no country that have 4 bronze medal.”
- Finding: False in the available dataset. At least one nation has exactly 4 bronze medals.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table: public.t_1967_world_judo_championships (1967 World Judo Championships medal table).
- Relevant columns: nation (text), gold (bigint), silver (bigint), bronze (bigint), total (bigint), rank (bigint).

Evidence
1) Nations with exactly 4 bronze medals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nation, bronze 
  FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships 
  WHERE bronze = 4;
- Result:
  - Nation: Japan, Bronze: 4

2) Count of nations with exactly 4 bronze medals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS num_nations_with_4_bronze FROM t_1967_world_judo_championships WHERE bronze = 4;
- Result: 1 nation

Conclusion
- There exists at least one country (Japan) with exactly 4 bronze medals in the 1967 World Judo Championships dataset. Therefore, the claim that “there be no country that have 4 bronze medal” is contradicted by the data.
