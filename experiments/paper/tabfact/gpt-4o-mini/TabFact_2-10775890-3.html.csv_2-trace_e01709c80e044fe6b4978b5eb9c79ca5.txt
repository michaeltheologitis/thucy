Claim to verify:
"On May 7, 1960, the crowd was larger than 23,135 at a game where the away team scored 3.8 (26) and the home team scored 5.12 (42)."

Step 1: Identify the match with the specified scores
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", crowd, venue 
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season 
WHERE "away team score" = '3.8 (26)' AND "home team score" = '5.12 (42)';

- Result:
Date: 7 May 1960
Home Team: North Melbourne
Away Team: Richmond
Home Team Score: 5.12 (42)
Away Team Score: 3.8 (26)
Crowd: 9,000
Venue: Arden Street Oval

Interpretation: The specified scoreline corresponds to North Melbourne (home) vs Richmond (away) on 7 May 1960, with a recorded crowd of 9,000.

Step 2: Directly test the claim condition (crowd > 23,135) for that exact scoreline
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", crowd, venue 
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season 
WHERE "away team score" = '3.8 (26)' AND "home team score" = '5.12 (42)' AND crowd > 23135;

- Result: No rows returned.

Step 3: Cross-check all matches on 7 May 1960
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", "home team score", "away team score", crowd, venue 
FROM public.t_1960_vfl_season 
WHERE date ILIKE '%7 May 1960%';

- Result (subset relevant to claim):
1) North Melbourne vs Richmond — Home 5.12 (42), Away 3.8 (26), Crowd 9,000, Venue: Arden Street Oval
(Other matches that day had larger crowds, e.g., Essendon vs Collingwood at 30,000 and Melbourne vs South Melbourne at 23,135, but they did not match the specified scoreline.)

Conclusion:
The only match on 7 May 1960 with away 3.8 (26) and home 5.12 (42) drew a crowd of 9,000, which is not larger than 23,135. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The table public.t_1960_vfl_season is authoritative for VFL matches in 1960, with date stored as text and scorelines stored as text in the format 'goals.behinds (points)'.
- The date string '7 May 1960' in the dataset corresponds to May 7, 1960.
