Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and focused on the single accessible table containing San Antonio Spurs 2008-09 season data.
- Reviewed the table schema to identify relevant columns (game number and date).
- Queried the table to verify the date associated with game 4 and cross-checked by filtering on the date value.

Data source discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season (San Antonio Spurs 2008-09 season).

Schema details consulted
- Table: t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season
  - Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), "high points" (text), "high rebounds" (text), "high assists" (text), "location attendance" (text), series (text)
  - The column game represents the game number; date is the game date.

Evidence 1: Query by game number
- Result: For game number 4, date = April 25; team = Dallas; series = 1 - 3.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, team, series FROM t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season WHERE game = 4;

Evidence 2: Cross-check by date value (case-sensitive match)
- Note: The stored value is in lowercase as 'april 25'.
- Result: game = 4; date = April 25; team = Dallas; series = 1 - 3.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, team, series FROM t_2008_09_san_antonio_spurs_season WHERE date = 'april 25';

Conclusion
- The database shows that game 4 occurred on April 25. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the dataset available (San Antonio Spurs 2008-09 season) and to the entry labeled game = 4 in that dataset.
- The claim’s “april 25” is a date without specifying a year; the table stores it as lowercase text ('april 25').
