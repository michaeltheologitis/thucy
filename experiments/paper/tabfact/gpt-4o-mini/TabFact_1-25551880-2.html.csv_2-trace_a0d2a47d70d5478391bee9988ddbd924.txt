Summary conclusion: The data shows that Stage 3 of the 2010 Vuelta a España was won by Philippe Gilbert, not Tyler Farrar. Tyler Farrar is listed as the winner of stages 5 and 21 in that event.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Verify Stage 3 winner
- SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE stage = 3;
- Result (key fields):
  - Stage: 3
  - Winner: Philippe Gilbert
  - General Classification: Philippe Gilbert
  - Points Classification: Philippe Gilbert
  - Mountains Classification: Serafín Martínez
  - Combination Classification: Serafín Martínez
  - Team Classification: Team HTC - Columbia

2) Check if Tyler Farrar won any stages in the 2010 Vuelta a España
- SQL:
SELECT stage, winner FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a WHERE LOWER(winner) LIKE '%farrar%';
- Result:
  - Stage 5, Winner: Tyler Farrar
  - Stage 21, Winner: Tyler Farrar

Assessment:
- The claim that Tyler Farrar was the winner of Stage 3 is contradicted by the data for the 2010 Vuelta a España.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to Stage 3 of the 2010 Vuelta a España, because the available authoritative data source covers this event. The word “time” in the user’s message was treated as extraneous, since the dataset does not specify stage type and the verification hinges on the stage winner.
