Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Brian Watts did not record a single top-25 finish at the Masters Tournament (i.e., zero top-25s at the Masters).

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL with a single table public.brian_watts containing aggregated career stats by tournament for golfer Brian Watts.

Relevant table schema (from data source):
- tournament (text)
- wins (bigint)
- top - 5 (bigint)
- top - 25 (bigint)
- events (bigint)
- cuts made (bigint)

Evidence query and result:
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT tournament,
         wins,
         "top - 5",
         "top - 25",
         events,
         "cuts made"
  FROM public.brian_watts
  WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Masters%';

- Returned row:
  Tournament: Masters Tournament; Wins: 0; Top-5: 0; Top-25: 0; Events: 2; Cuts made: 1

Assessment:
- The data shows Brian Watts has 0 top-25 finishes at the Masters Tournament. This directly supports the claim that he did not make the top 25 even once at the Masters.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the database evidence.

Assumptions made:
- "brian watt" refers to the professional golfer Brian Watts. 
- "master tournament" refers to the Masters Tournament at Augusta National.
- The intent of "not the top 25 ... 1 time" is interpreted as "did not achieve a top-25 finish even once (i.e., zero times)."
