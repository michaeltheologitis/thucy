Claim interpreted: “the pga championship have 3 more cut made than the us open.” Interpreted as: For golfer Brian Watts, his ‘cuts made’ in the PGA Championship exceed his ‘cuts made’ in the U.S. Open by 3.

Data source inspected: Database TabFact, schema public, table public.brian_watts with columns: tournament (text), wins (bigint), top - 5 (bigint), top - 25 (bigint), events (bigint), cuts made (bigint).

Evidence from data:
1) Retrieve all tournaments and cuts made
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "cuts made" FROM public.brian_watts;
Result snapshot (relevant rows):
- us open — 1
- pga championship — 4

2) Compute the precise difference via conditional aggregation
SQL executed:
SELECT 
    SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(tournament) = 'pga championship' THEN "cuts made" ELSE 0 END) 
    - SUM(CASE WHEN LOWER(tournament) IN ('us open', 'u.s. open') THEN "cuts made" ELSE 0 END) AS cuts_difference 
FROM public.brian_watts;
Result: cuts_difference = 3

Conclusion: Brian Watts has 4 cuts made in the PGA Championship and 1 in the U.S. Open, a difference of 3 in favor of the PGA Championship. This matches the claim.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to Brian Watts (the sole available dataset is public.brian_watts).
- “cut made” is interpreted as the ‘cuts made’ metric in the table.
- Tournament naming differences (‘US Open’ vs. ‘U.S. Open’) are treated equivalently and matched case-insensitively.
