Claim to verify: “on september 22 23 , 3380 crowd witness a win against the yankee of 8 - 1.”

Interpretation of the claim:
- Event date: September 22 (the “22 23” phrasing is ambiguous; we interpret it as September 22 in the covered season).
- Opponent: Yankees.
- Result: Win by 8–1.
- Attendance: 3,380.

Data source consulted:
- public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (authoritative dataset available in this environment for the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season)

Evidence gathered from the database
1) Identify whether the Blue Jays played the Yankees in the dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY opponent;
Result (excerpt): Angels; Athletics; Mariners; Mets; Orioles; Rangers; Red Sox; Yankees

2) Find any Blue Jays game(s) with a final score of 8–1 (or 1–8), and see the opponent and attendance
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance 
FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE REPLACE(score, ' ', '') LIKE '8-1' OR REPLACE(score, ' ', '') LIKE '1-8' 
ORDER BY date;
Result returned by the database:
- Date: September 22
- Opponent: Yankees
- Score: 8 - 1
- Attendance: 23,380

Assessment of each element of the claim
- Date: Supported by the data (a game exists on September 22 in the dataset with the cited result).
- Opponent (Yankees): Supported by the data.
- Result (8–1 win): Supported by the data.
- Attendance (“3380”): Not supported. The database shows 23,380 for that game.

Conclusion: The core event (Blue Jays defeating the Yankees 8–1 on September 22) is supported. However, the stated attendance is incorrect by a factor of 10 (should be 23,380, not 3,380).

Assumptions made:
- Because the only authoritative dataset available pertains to the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season, the claim is evaluated within that scope. We interpret “september 22 23” as the date format used in that table (September 22 of that season) and “yankee” as the New York Yankees. If the claim was intended to reference a different team, league, or year, that information is outside the accessible data and could change the evaluation.
