Summary conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. The TabFact.viral_disease table shows seven viral families with a helical virion shape, not two.

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Inspect all records
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM viral_disease;
Key relevant rows returned (family → virion shape):
- coronaviridae → helical
- orthomyxoviridae → helical
- arenaviridae → helical
- bunyaviridae → helical
- filoviridae → helical
- paramyxoviridae → helical
- rhabdoviridae → helical, bullet shaped

2) List distinct families whose virion shape includes the word "helical"
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT family FROM viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%helical%';
Resulting families:
- Arenaviridae
- Bunyaviridae
- Coronaviridae
- Filoviridae
- Orthomyxoviridae
- Paramyxoviridae
- Rhabdoviridae

3) Count those distinct families
Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) FROM viral_disease WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%helical%';
Result: 7

Assessment: The data clearly indicates 7 viral families with helical virion shape descriptors, contradicting the claim that there are 2.

Assumptions made:
- “viral family” refers to the 'family' column in the TabFact.viral_disease table.
- “helical virion shape” is matched by any 'virion shape' value containing the substring "helical" (case-insensitive).
