Scope and interpretation
- I interpreted the claim within the only available data source: the 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs table. I treat “point” as “goals” and assess whether Canon Yaoundé scored 5 more goals than their opponent in the recorded tie(s).

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
- Columns: team 1 (text), agg (text), team 2 (text), 1st leg (text), 2nd leg (text)

Evidence 1: Identify Canon Yaoundé’s tie and aggregate score
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", agg, "1st leg", "2nd leg"
FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs
WHERE LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%canon%' OR LOWER("team 1") LIKE '%yaound%'
   OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%canon%' OR LOWER("team 2") LIKE '%yaound%';

Result:
- team 1: canon yaoundé | team 2: as solidarité | agg: 9 - 4 | 1st leg: 7 - 3 | 2nd leg: 2 - 1

Evidence 2: Compute aggregate goal difference
Executed SQL:
SELECT "team 1", "team 2", agg, 
       (CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, '-', 1) AS INTEGER) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(agg, '-', 2) AS INTEGER)) AS goal_difference 
FROM public.t_1971_african_cup_of_champions_clubs 
WHERE "team 1" = 'canon yaoundé';

Result:
- goal_difference: 5 (9 - 4)

Assessment
- The available data shows Canon Yaoundé beat AS Solidarité on aggregate 9–4, which is a +5 goal margin. This directly supports the claim that they “score 5 more point than their opponent,” interpreted as goals in this tie.

Assumptions
- “Point” is interpreted as “goals” in the context of match/tie scoring.
- The claim refers to the recorded 1971 African Cup of Champions Clubs tie present in the dataset.
- Matching is case- and accent-insensitive for identification of Canon Yaoundé.
