Claim to verify: “.553 be the average win percentage of a season without a gb of 5.”

Interpretation used: GB refers to “games behind” in the Nashville Sounds seasons dataset. “Without a gb of 5” is taken to mean: exclude seasons where gb = '5', then compute the average win percentage over the remaining seasons.

Data source overview
- Available database: Nashville Sounds database
- Table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
- Relevant fields: year (text), record (text), win % (bigint, stored in thousandths, e.g., 535 = .535), gb (text)

Evidence and SQL
1) Inspect sample rows (to confirm structure and values)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons LIMIT 10;

Result excerpt (as returned): shows “win %” values like 454, 576, 678 and gb values like '-', '22½', '3½', etc., confirming win % is stored in thousandths and gb is text with possible fractions.

2) Confirm that a gb value of '5' exists and how many seasons it affects
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt_gb_5 FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb = '5';

Result: cnt_gb_5 = 1

3) Compute overall average winning percentage (as decimal)
SQL:
SELECT AVG("win %") / 1000.0 AS overall_average_winning_percentage FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons;

Result: overall_average_winning_percentage ≈ 0.5138 (51.38%)

4) Compute average winning percentage excluding seasons where gb = '5' (as decimal)
SQL:
SELECT AVG("win %") / 1000.0 AS average_winning_percentage_excluding_gb_5 FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons WHERE gb != '5';

Result: average_winning_percentage_excluding_gb_5 ≈ 0.5132 (51.32%)

Conclusion
- The data show that when excluding the one season with gb = '5', the average win percentage is approximately 0.513, not 0.553. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “GB” is interpreted as “games behind” from the gb column.
- “Average win percentage … without a gb of 5” is interpreted as the average win percentage over all seasons except those with gb exactly equal to '5'.
- Win percentage is stored in thousandths; thus we divide by 1000.0 to express it as a decimal fraction.
