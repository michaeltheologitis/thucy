Summary of Findings
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade containing foreign trade data for Romanian counties/regions.
- Relevant columns: county, exports (us mil), percent of total exports, imports (us mil), percent of total imports.

Evidence from the database
1) Retrieve Centru entry directly
Executed SQL:
SELECT "exports (us mil)", "percent of total exports", "imports (us mil)", "percent of total imports" 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE LOWER(county) = LOWER('Centru')

Result:
- Exports (US mil): 5,338
- Percent of total exports: 12.8%
- Imports (US mil): 7,879.4
- Percent of total imports: 11.8%

2) Confirm all rows containing 'Centru'
Executed SQL:
SELECT county, "percent of total exports", "percent of total imports" 
FROM public.list_of_romanian_counties_by_foreign_trade 
WHERE LOWER(county) LIKE '%centru%';

Result:
- county: centru; percent of total exports: 12.8 %; percent of total imports: 11.8 %

Assessment of the claim
- Claimed: exports share = 13.8%; Data shows 12.8% → Not matching.
- Claimed: imports share = 11.2%; Data shows 11.8% → Not matching.

Conclusion: Both claimed percentages differ from the database values.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "centru county" as the row labeled "centru" in the table, which represents the Centru region aggregate in the provided dataset.
- Interpreted "percentage of total export/import" as the columns percent of total exports and percent of total imports in the table.
