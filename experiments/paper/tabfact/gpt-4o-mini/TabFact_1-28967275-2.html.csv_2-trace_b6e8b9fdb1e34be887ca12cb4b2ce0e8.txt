Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database with a table storing episode information.
- Inspected the schema to confirm relevant columns (episode number and episode title).
- Queried the table for episode = 28 to verify its title.

Data source and schema
- Database: Primary PostgreSQL Database (public schema)
- Table: public.my_info_table
- Relevant columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "production code" (bigint)

Evidence
- Result: The database contains a row where episode = 28 with the following values:
  - Episode: 28
  - Series: 2
  - Episode Title: the suspension
  - Production Code: 202

Executed SQL (as evidence)
SELECT episode, series, "episode title", "production code" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE episode = 28;

Conclusion
- The claim that episode 28 is titled "the suspension" is supported by the data returned from the authoritative table.

Assumptions
- "Episode 28" refers to the row in public.my_info_table where the episode column equals 28.
- Title matching is case-insensitive; the stored value is "the suspension" in lowercase, which is accepted as equivalent to "The Suspension".
