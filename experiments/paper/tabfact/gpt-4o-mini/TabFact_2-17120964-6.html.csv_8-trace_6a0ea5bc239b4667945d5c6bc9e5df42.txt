Claim interpreted: In a League/Cup competition match against the Swindon Wildcats, the team (Guildford Flames, based on available data) lost 4–2, and Neil Liddiard was named Man of the Match.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table: t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season (Guildford Flames 2008–09 season). Relevant columns: date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (text), competition (text), man of the match (text).

Evidence gathered:
1) Matches vs. Swindon Wildcats (shows opponent, competition, result, Man of the Match)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, competition, result, "man of the match"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Swindon%';
- Results returned:
  • Date: 8th | Opponent: Swindon Wildcats | Competition: League / Cup | Result: Won 6 - 3 | Man of the Match: Lukas Smital
  • Date: 9th | Opponent: Swindon Wildcats | Competition: League / Cup | Result: Won 4 - 2 | Man of the Match: Neil Liddiard

2) Check for any instance of a 4–2 loss with Man of the Match = Neil Liddiard
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, competition, result, "man of the match"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_guildford_flames_season
  WHERE result = 'Lost 4 - 2' AND "man of the match" = 'Neil Liddiard';
- Result: No rows returned.

Assessment:
- Opponent: Swindon Wildcats — supported.
- Competition type: League / Cup — supported.
- Scoreline and Man of the Match: A 4–2 score with Neil Liddiard as Man of the Match occurred — supported, but it was a 4–2 win, not a loss.
- Outcome (lost): contradicted by data; the match with Neil Liddiard as Man of the Match ended 4–2 in favor of the Flames.

Conclusion: The data shows a League/Cup game vs. Swindon Wildcats where the Guildford Flames won 4–2 and Neil Liddiard was Man of the Match. There is no evidence of a 4–2 loss with Neil Liddiard as Man of the Match in the available 2008–09 data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Guildford Flames due to the scope of the available database (2008–09 season). Other seasons/teams are outside the accessible data and were not considered.
