Claim interpreted: The user asserts that a Bell Media radio station uses the call sign CHSU-FM and broadcasts on 99.9 FM.

Data sources consulted:
- PostgreSQL database, public schema, table: media_in_kelowna (columns: frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Exact call-sign lookup (no rows returned)
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, branding, format, owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE "call sign" = 'CHSU-FM';

2) Broader search by frequency/owner/call-sign fragment (returned one matching row)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE frequency LIKE '%99.9%' OR owner LIKE '%Bell%' OR "call sign" LIKE '%CHSU%';
Result:
- frequency: "00 99.9 fm"
- call sign: "chsu - fm"
- branding: "99.9 sun fm"
- format: "contemporary hits radio"
- owner: "bell media"

3) Targeted normalized match for owner and call sign (confirmed the same row)
SQL:
SELECT "call sign", frequency, owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE lower(owner) LIKE '%bell media%' AND lower("call sign") LIKE '%chsu%';
Result:
- call sign: "chsu - fm"
- frequency: "00 99.9 fm"
- owner: "bell media"

Assessment:
- The table lists a station with owner "bell media", call sign written as "chsu - fm" (case and spacing variations), and frequency text containing "99.9 fm". These data points substantively match the claim that Bell Media’s station CHSU-FM operates on 99.9 FM.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the available source.

Assumptions made:
- Variations in case and spacing/hyphenation (e.g., "chsu - fm" vs. "CHSU-FM") refer to the same call sign.
- The frequency value "00 99.9 fm" is a formatting artifact and indicates the 99.9 FM frequency.
- The claim pertains to media in Kelowna, consistent with the scope of the available dataset.
