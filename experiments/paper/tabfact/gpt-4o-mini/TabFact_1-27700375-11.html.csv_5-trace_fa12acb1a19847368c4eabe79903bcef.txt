Claim interpreted: “Brook Lopez led the team in assists in more games than Deron Williams did.” Scope grounded to the available dataset: 2010–11 New Jersey Nets games (7 games present in the table t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season).

Evidence from data

1) Total games in scope
- Result: 7
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;

2) Games where Deron Williams led the team in assists
- Result: 3 games
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%deron williams%'

- Supporting detail (dates and values):
  - April 1 — Deron Williams (7)
  - April 3 — Deron Williams (9)
  - April 5 — Deron Williams (21)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "high assists" FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%deron williams%';

3) Games where Brook Lopez led the team in assists
- Result: 0 games
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%brook lopez%';

Additional context (not required to judge the claim but corroborative)
- Distinct “high assists” entries and frequencies show leaders are Jordan Farmar and Deron Williams in this span; Brook Lopez does not appear.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "high assists", COUNT(*) as frequency 
FROM t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season 
GROUP BY "high assists" 
ORDER BY frequency DESC;
- Result excerpt:
  - jordan farmar (9) — 2
  - deron williams (21) — 1
  - deron williams (9) — 1
  - jordan farmar (11) — 1
  - deron williams (7) — 1
  - jordan farmar (7) — 1

Conclusion
Based on the available data for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets games in this table (7 games), Deron Williams led the team in assists 3 times, while Brook Lopez led 0 times. Therefore, the claim that “Brook Lopez led the team in assists for more games than Deron Williams” is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated within the scope of the available dataset: the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets table provided (which contains 7 games, likely the final games of the season). No additional seasons or teams are included because they are not present in the accessible data.
