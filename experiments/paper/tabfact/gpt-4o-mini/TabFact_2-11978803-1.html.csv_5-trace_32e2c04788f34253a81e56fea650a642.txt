Claim being verified: “the friendly competition at the venue Shymkent, Kazakhstan, be on June 2, 2007.”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table in schema public: branimir_suba_i (columns: date TEXT, venue TEXT, score TEXT, result TEXT, competition TEXT).

Step 1: Identify any friendly matches in Shymkent, Kazakhstan in 2007
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE competition ILIKE '%friendly%' AND (venue ILIKE '%shym%' OR venue ILIKE '%chimkent%') AND date ILIKE '%2007%';
- Result:
  - date: march 7 , 2007; venue: shymkent , kazakhstan; competition: friendly; result: win; score: 0 - 1
- Interpretation: There is a friendly match recorded in Shymkent, Kazakhstan in 2007, but it is on March 7, 2007, not June 2, 2007.

Step 2: Directly test for an entry on June 2, 2007 at Shymkent
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE venue ILIKE '%shymkent%' AND date ILIKE '%june%2%2007%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: No record exists for a Shymkent event on June 2, 2007 in the dataset.

Step 3: List all entries for Shymkent to confirm available dates
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE venue ILIKE '%shymkent%';
- Result:
  - date: march 7 , 2007; venue: shymkent , kazakhstan; competition: friendly; result: win; score: 0 - 1
- Interpretation: The only Shymkent entry present is on March 7, 2007.

Step 4: Check alternate spelling (Chimkent) for 2007
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, competition, result, score FROM public.branimir_suba_i WHERE venue ILIKE '%chimkent%' AND date ILIKE '%2007%';
- Result: No rows returned.
- Interpretation: No alternate spelling entry exists for 2007 that would support the claim.

Findings:
- The dataset records a friendly competition in Shymkent, Kazakhstan in 2007, but specifically on March 7, 2007. There is no evidence of a friendly competition at that venue on June 2, 2007.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the friendly competition at Shymkent, Kazakhstan was on June 2, 2007 is not supported by the data. The evidence indicates a different date (March 7, 2007).

Assumptions made:
- “Friendly competition” corresponds to rows where competition contains the word “friendly.”
- “Venue Shymkent, Kazakhstan” matches venue strings containing “shymkent” (and we also tested the alternate spelling “chimkent”).
- Date “June 2, 2007” was searched in several textual patterns, but no such record exists in the table.
