Claim to verify: “Netherlands and Romania have game on June 24 and 28, respectively, in 1998.”

Approach
- Explore available data sources and schema.
- Query for records on June 24 and June 28, 1998.
- Search for any mentions of “Netherlands” or “Romania” across the dataset.

Data source discovered
- A single PostgreSQL table: public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football (date text, venue text, score text, comp text, report text). This table documents Paraguayan football events/matches in 1998.

Evidence
1) Check if there is a record for 1998-06-24
- Result: A World Cup match entry exists on that date (associated with Paraguay; venue in France).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, comp, venue, score, report FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date = '1998 - 06 - 24';
- Returned row (summarized): date=1998 - 06 - 24; comp=World Cup; venue=Stade de Toulouse, Toulouse, France; score=1 - 3; report=report.

2) Check if there is a record for 1998-06-28
- Result: A World Cup match entry exists on that date (associated with Paraguay; venue in France).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, comp, venue, score, report 
FROM t_1998_in_paraguayan_football 
WHERE date = '1998 - 06 - 28';
- Returned row (summarized): date=1998 - 06 - 28; comp=world cup; venue=stade félix bollaert lens , france; score=0 - 0 (1 - 0 aet); report=report.

3) Search for any mentions of “Netherlands” or “Romania” anywhere in the dataset
- Result: Mentions occur only on June 1 and June 3, 1998, in the venue field (indicating locations), not on June 24 or June 28.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, comp, score FROM public.t_1998_in_paraguayan_football WHERE date ILIKE '%nether%' OR date ILIKE '%romania%' OR venue ILIKE '%nether%' OR venue ILIKE '%romania%' OR score ILIKE '%nether%' OR score ILIKE '%romania%' OR comp ILIKE '%nether%' OR comp ILIKE '%romania%' OR report ILIKE '%nether%' OR report ILIKE '%romania%' ;
- Returned rows (summarized):
  • 1998 - 06 - 01: venue=philips stadion eindhoven , netherlands; comp=f; score=5 - 1.
  • 1998 - 06 - 03: venue=steaua stadium bucharest , romania; comp=f; score=3 - 2.

Assessment
- The only authoritative data available concerns Paraguayan football in 1998. It records World Cup matches on June 24 and June 28, 1998, but does not indicate these were Netherlands’ or Romania’s matches.
- The dataset’s only mentions of Netherlands and Romania (as venue locations) are on June 1 and June 3, 1998—not June 24 or June 28.
- Therefore, within the scope of the accessible data, the claim that Netherlands and Romania have games on June 24 and 28, respectively, is unsupported.

Conclusion
- Based on the available evidence, the claim is not supported by the dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “have game” as “played a match.”
- Interpreted “respectively” to map Netherlands → June 24, 1998; Romania → June 28, 1998.
- The verification is constrained to the accessible dataset (Paraguayan football, 1998), treated as authoritative within its scope as instructed.
