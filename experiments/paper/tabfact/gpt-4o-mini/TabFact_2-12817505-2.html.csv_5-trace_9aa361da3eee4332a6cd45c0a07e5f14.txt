Claim to verify: “Manchester United have always lost 3 out of 3 times to Portsmouth since 10 September 2005.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact (public schema)
- Available relevant table: t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season

Schema details (public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season)
- Columns: date (text), opponents (text), h / a (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint), league position (text)

Evidence
1) Verify that “Portsmouth” appears as an opponent
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT opponents FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season;
- Result (excerpt): Portsmouth is listed among distinct opponents (along with Liverpool, Arsenal, etc.).

2) Count Manchester United matches vs Portsmouth in the available season dataset
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Portsmouth%';
- Result: 2 matches

3) List match details vs Portsmouth
- SQL: SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a" FROM public.t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season WHERE opponents ILIKE '%Portsmouth%';
- Results:
  - Date: 3 December 2005 | Opponents: Portsmouth | Home/Away: Home | Result f - a: 3 - 0
  - Date: 11 February 2006 | Opponents: Portsmouth | Home/Away: Away | Result f - a: 3 - 1

Analysis
- Both listed matches took place after 10 September 2005 (on 3 Dec 2005 and 11 Feb 2006).
- In both matches, the “result f - a” shows Manchester United scored more goals than Portsmouth (3-0 and 3-1), i.e., Manchester United won both fixtures.
- The number of matches vs Portsmouth in the accessible period (the 2005–06 season) is 2, not 3.
- Therefore, within the authoritative data available, the claim that Manchester United “always lost 3 out of 3” since 10 September 2005 is contradicted: they won 2 out of 2 in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data; it is contradicted by recorded results showing two wins and only two matches, not three, since the stated date (within the 2005–06 season).

Assumptions and scope
- “Manchester unite” is interpreted as Manchester United F.C.
- “Since 10 September 2005” is taken to mean on/after that date.
- The verification is grounded in the available authoritative dataset for the 2005–06 season. Data for seasons beyond 2005–06 were not accessible; however, even within this time window after 10 September 2005, the claim’s core assertion (3/3 losses) is false because there were 2 matches and both were wins.
- “result f - a” is interpreted as Manchester United’s goals (for) first, opponents’ goals (against) second, which is consistent with the listed outcomes.
