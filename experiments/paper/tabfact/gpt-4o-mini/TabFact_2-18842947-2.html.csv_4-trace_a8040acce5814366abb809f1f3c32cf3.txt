Claim interpreted: “The Packers scored the least amount of points (6) in a game versus the Lions.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing one table relevant to this topic: t_1976_detroit_lions_season (1976 Detroit Lions season schedule/results).

Schema summary (t_1976_detroit_lions_season)
- week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)
- The result field encodes outcome and score in the form: "w X - Y" (Lions won X–Y) or "l X - Y" (Lions lost X–Y).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Query
SELECT * FROM t_1976_detroit_lions_season LIMIT 20;

Key returned rows (subset shown here are the two Packers games; these were included in the query output):
- Week 4 | October 3, 1976 | Green Bay Packers | l 24 - 14 | 55041
  Interpretation: Lions lost 24–14; opponent (Packers) scored 24; Lions scored 14.
- Week 8 | October 31, 1976 | Green Bay Packers | w 27 - 6 | 74992
  Interpretation: Lions won 27–6; opponent (Packers) scored 6; Lions scored 27.

Cross-check within the 1976 season dataset
- Reading all results returned by the query shows opponent points vs Lions in 1976 were: 10 (Bears), 10 (Falcons), 10 (Vikings), 24 (Packers), 10 (Patriots), 20 (Redskins), 14 (Seahawks), 6 (Packers), 31 (Vikings), 17 (Saints), 10 (Bears), 14 (Bills), 24 (Giants), 17/20 (Rams; listed as 20 - 17 meaning opponent 20).
- The lowest opponent point total in any 1976 Lions game is 6, and it was by the Green Bay Packers on October 31, 1976 (Lions 27–6 Packers).

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (the 1976 Detroit Lions season), the Packers indeed scored the fewest points (6) among all Lions’ opponents that season.

Assumptions and scope
- The claim was interpreted as referring to the 1976 season because the only accessible authoritative data covers the 1976 Detroit Lions season. This verification does not extend beyond 1976 due to data availability in the connected sources.
