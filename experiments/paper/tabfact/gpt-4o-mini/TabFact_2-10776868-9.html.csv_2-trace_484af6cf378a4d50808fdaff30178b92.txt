Summary of findings:
- We verified the claim using the available 1962 VFL season data. In that dataset, the South Melbourne vs Richmond match and the Hawthorn vs North Melbourne match both occurred on 23 June 1962. The recorded crowds were 17,000 and 8,470 respectively. Therefore, the South Melbourne–Richmond match drew a larger crowd than the Hawthorn–North Melbourne game in the 1962 season.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Context check: sample rows from the table to confirm columns and values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season LIMIT 10;
- Returned sample includes both target fixtures on 23 June 1962:
  • South Melbourne vs Richmond — Venue: Lake Oval — Crowd: 17,000 — Date: 23 June 1962
  • North Melbourne vs Hawthorn — Venue: Arden Street Oval — Crowd: 8,470 — Date: 23 June 1962

2) Targeted retrieval of all 1962 matches for the two pairs
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, "home team", "away team", crowd FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE (lower("home team") = 'south melbourne' AND lower("away team") = 'richmond') OR (lower("home team") = 'richmond' AND lower("away team") = 'south melbourne') UNION SELECT date, venue, "home team", "away team", crowd FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE (lower("home team") = 'hawthorn' AND lower("away team") = 'north melbourne') OR (lower("home team") = 'north melbourne' AND lower("away team") = 'hawthorn') ORDER BY date;
- Results:
  • North Melbourne vs Hawthorn — Date: 23 June 1962 — Venue: Arden Street Oval — Crowd: 8,470
  • South Melbourne vs Richmond — Date: 23 June 1962 — Venue: Lake Oval — Crowd: 17,000

Conclusion:
- 17,000 (South Melbourne vs Richmond) > 8,470 (Hawthorn vs North Melbourne). The claim is supported by the data in the 1962 VFL season table.

Assumptions:
- The user did not specify a season/date. We interpreted the claim within the scope of the available authoritative data source (the 1962 VFL season).
