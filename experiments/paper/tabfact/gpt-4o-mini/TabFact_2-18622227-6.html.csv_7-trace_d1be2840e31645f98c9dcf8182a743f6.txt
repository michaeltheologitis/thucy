Claim to verify: “the wimbledon have the same result in the year 1986 and 1999.”

Data source exploration
- Available database: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.katrina_adams (columns include: tournament, and per-year result fields such as "1986" … "1999"). This table contains tournament-wise yearly results.

Evidence from data
1) Retrieve all tournaments with 1986 and 1999 values
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM public.katrina_adams;

Result excerpt (relevant row):
- Tournament: Wimbledon | 1986: A | 1999: 1R

Assessment
- For Wimbledon, the 1986 result is “A” (absent) and the 1999 result is “1R” (lost in the first round). These are not the same.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data in the public.katrina_adams table.

Assumptions noted
- Interpreted “the wimbledon have the same result” as referring to the Wimbledon results recorded in the katrina_adams table (i.e., the player’s tournament results by year). If the intent was about overall championship winners or other event-level outcomes, that is outside the scope of this table; the verification here is grounded strictly in the available dataset.
