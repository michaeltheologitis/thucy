Claim to verify: “2.3 million people in Africa saw the episode titled ‘Rabid.’”

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database (schema: public) with one table: smallville_season_9

Schema inspection (smallville_season_9):
- Columns: no (biginteger), - (biginteger), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), us air date (text), production code (text), us viewers (million) (double precision)
- Notably, the only viewership field is “us viewers (million),” indicating US audience counts; there are no fields for Africa or other regions.

Evidence gathered from the database:
1) SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT title FROM smallville_season_9;
Result (relevant excerpt): includes the title “Rabid,” confirming an episode with this title exists in the table.

2) SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM smallville_season_9 WHERE title = 'rabid';
Result (as returned by the tool):
- Episode Number: 177
- Title: Rabid
- Directed By: Michael Rohl
- Written By: Jordan Hawley
- US Air Date: October 9, 2009
- Production Code: 3x5253
- US Viewers (Million): 2.3

Assessment:
- The data confirms that an episode titled “Rabid” exists (Smallville, Season 9), and it drew 2.3 million viewers in the United States.
- The database contains no metrics for Africa. The only available viewership figure is specifically labeled “US Viewers (Million).” Therefore, there is no evidence supporting that 2.3 million people in Africa watched this episode, and the region specified in the claim is contradicted by the available field definition (US-specific viewership).

Conclusion: The number 2.3 million aligns with US viewership for “Rabid,” but the claim that this count pertains to Africa is not supported by the data source and is contradicted by the field’s US designation.

Assumptions made:
- “Episode title rabid” refers to the Smallville Season 9 episode “Rabid,” as this is the only relevant episode data available in the connected data source.
