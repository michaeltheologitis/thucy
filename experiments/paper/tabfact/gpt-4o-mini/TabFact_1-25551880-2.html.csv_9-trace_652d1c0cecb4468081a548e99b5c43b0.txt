Claim interpreted: The user asks whether Mark Cavendish won 5 stages consecutively. Based on the available data (2010 Vuelta a España table), we verify if he ever had a 5-stage consecutive winning streak within that event.

Findings from the data
- In the 2010 Vuelta a España, Mark Cavendish’s longest consecutive winning streak was 2 stages (Stages 12 and 13). He also won Stage 18. There is no 5-stage consecutive streak in this dataset.

Query results
1) Longest streak of consecutive stages won by Mark Cavendish
- Start Stage: 12
- End Stage: 13
- Length: 2
- Stages: [12, 13]

2) Individual stages won by Mark Cavendish
- Stages: [12, 13, 18]

Executed SQL (as evidence)
1) Query to find the longest streak of consecutive stages won by Mark Cavendish:
WITH wins AS (
    SELECT stage,
           (stage - ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY stage)) AS streak_group
    FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
    WHERE LOWER(winner) = 'mark cavendish'
),
     grouped_streaks AS (
    SELECT streak_group,
           MIN(stage) AS start_stage,
           MAX(stage) AS end_stage,
           COUNT(stage) AS length,
           ARRAY_AGG(stage) AS stages
    FROM wins
    GROUP BY streak_group
)
SELECT start_stage,
       end_stage,
       length,
       stages
FROM grouped_streaks
ORDER BY length DESC
LIMIT 1;

2) Query to list all individual stages won by Mark Cavendish:
SELECT DISTINCT stage
FROM public.t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
WHERE LOWER(winner) = 'mark cavendish';

Conclusion
- The claim that Mark Cavendish won 5 stages consecutively is not supported by the available data for the 2010 Vuelta a España. The longest consecutive streak visible in this dataset is 2 stages.

Assumptions
- The claim is verified against the available data source, which contains results for the 2010 Vuelta a España only.
- “Consecutively” is interpreted as back-to-back stage numbers within the same event.
- Name matching for the winner is performed case-insensitively against the exact string “Mark Cavendish.”
