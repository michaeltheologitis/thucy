the vcpc and vctp of 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun be the same for vcrt 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon , and so be the vcpc and vcrt of 75 km / h (47 mph) for vctp 75 km / h (47 mph)

Claim interpreted as two sub-claims:
1) Armament: “VCPC and VCTP have a 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun, while VCRT has a 20 mm RH-202 autocannon.”
2) Speed: “VCPC and VCRT have a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), same as VCTP.”

Findings from the data
- Armament: The data show VCTP has the 20 mm RH-202 autocannon, while VCPC and VCRT have the 7.62 mm FN MAG 60-20 machine gun. This contradicts the claim’s armament mapping.
- Speed: The data show VCTP, VCPC, and VCRT each have a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph), supporting the claim’s speed equivalence.

Evidence with executed SQL
1) Table overview (context)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
Result excerpt (relevant rows/columns):
- Armament row:
  • vctp: "20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon"
  • vcpc: "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
  • vcrt: "7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun"
- Speed row:
  • vctp: "75 km / h (47 mph)"
  • vcpc: "75 km / h (47 mph)"
  • vcrt: "75 km / h (47 mph)"

2) Armament extraction (VCTP, VCPC, VCRT)
SQL:
SELECT vctp, vcpc, vcrt FROM tam_tank WHERE vctp LIKE '%rh - 202%';
Result:
- VCTP: 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon
- VCPC: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun
- VCRT: 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun
Interpretation: VCTP has the 20 mm autocannon; VCPC and VCRT have 7.62 mm machine guns.

3) Speed extraction (VCTP, VCPC, VCRT)
SQL:
SELECT vctp, vcpc, vcrt FROM tam_tank WHERE vctp LIKE '%75 km / h%';
Result:
- VCTP: 75 km / h (47 mph)
- VCPC: 75 km / h (47 mph)
- VCRT: 75 km / h (47 mph)
Interpretation: All three have the same top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).

Conclusion
- Armament portion: Inaccurate (the mapping is reversed in the claim vs. data).
- Speed portion: Accurate (all three are 75 km/h).

Assumptions due to ambiguous phrasing
- Interpreted “vcpc and vctp of 7.62 mm … be the same for vcrt 20 mm RH-202” as a claim that VCPC and VCTP mount 7.62 mm FN MAG, and VCRT mounts a 20 mm RH-202.
- Interpreted “vcpc and vcrt of 75 km/h … for vctp 75 km/h” as asserting all have the same 75 km/h top speed.
