Claim to verify: "active from 1947 - 1964, Titus Ozon score 157 goal"

Data source overview:
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL database with a table: public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country (columns: rank bigint, name text, years text, matches bigint, goals bigint).

Evidence gathered:
1) Primary evidence (substring name search): This query retrieves the player record containing 'Ozon' in the name and returns all relevant fields.
SQL executed:
SELECT rank, name, years, matches, goals FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE name ILIKE '%Ozon%';
Result:
- Rank: 10
- Name: Titus Ozon
- Years: 1947 - 1964
- Matches: 270
- Goals: 157

2) Negative check (exact name equality): This query checked for an exact match on the name; it returned no rows, likely due to formatting or whitespace differences in the stored value.
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_top_association_football_goal_scorers_by_country WHERE name = 'Titus Ozon';
Result: No rows returned.

Assessment:
- The substring search clearly identifies a record for Titus Ozon with the years "1947 - 1964" and goals "157". These directly support the claim that he was active from 1947 to 1964 and scored 157 goals.

Conclusion:
- Both key elements of the claim are supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes:
- "active from" is interpreted as the span shown in the table's "years" column.
- "score 157 goal" is interpreted as the total goals recorded in the table's "goals" column.
- The exact-name search returning no rows suggests the stored name may include formatting differences; the substring search provides the authoritative match used for verification.
