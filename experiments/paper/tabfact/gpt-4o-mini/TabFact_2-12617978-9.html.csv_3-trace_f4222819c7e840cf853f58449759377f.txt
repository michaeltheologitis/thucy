Claim interpreted: In Dragons' Den UK episode 7, the highest amount of money requested was 145,000, and it was requested by Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker.

Findings grounded in data:
1) What did Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker request, and which episode?
- Result: Episode 7; money requested = £100,000.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT episode, "money requested" FROM dragons_den_uk WHERE "entrepreneur (s)" LIKE '%jerry mantalvanos%' OR "entrepreneur (s)" LIKE '%paul merker%';

2) What is the maximum requested amount in Episode 7, and by whom?
- Result: Maximum requested amount = £100,000; associated with jerry mantalvanos & paul merker (note: see #3 for full episode list showing a tie at £100,000).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX("money requested") AS max_money, "entrepreneur (s)"
  FROM dragons_den_uk
  WHERE LOWER(episode) = 'episode 7'
  GROUP BY "entrepreneur (s)"
  ORDER BY max_money DESC
  LIMIT 1;

3) All Episode 7 requests (to verify the maximum and other contestants):
- Results (sorted by amount desc):
  - Sammy French — £100,000
  - Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker — £100,000
  Both requests were £100,000, i.e., a tie for the highest amount that episode.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested" FROM dragons_den_uk WHERE LOWER(episode) = 'episode 7' ORDER BY "money requested" DESC;

4) Did anyone in Episode 7 request £145,000?
- Result: No matching rows; £145,000 was not requested in Episode 7.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "entrepreneur (s)", "money requested" FROM dragons_den_uk WHERE LOWER(episode) = 'episode 7' AND "money requested" = 145000;

Conclusion:
- Jerry Mantalvanos & Paul Merker requested £100,000 (not £145,000) in Episode 7.
- The highest request in Episode 7 was £100,000, shared by them and Sammy French.
- No one requested £145,000 in Episode 7.

Assumptions made due to phrasing ambiguity:
- “Episode 7” refers to the Episode field value 'episode 7' in the Dragons' Den UK dataset.
- “Highest amount of money request by jerry mantalvanos & paul merker” is interpreted as asserting both (a) their request was £145,000 and (b) that amount was the highest requested in Episode 7.
