Summary conclusion
- The available data shows Alberto Pagani recorded 0 wins in the 250cc class in 1971 and, in fact, no wins in the 250cc class in any year. Therefore, the claim that 1971 was the only year he won twice in the 250cc class is not supported.

Data source discovery
- Available database objects:
  - Schema: public
    - Table: public.alberto_pagani
      - Columns: year (bigint, not null), class (text, not null), team (text, not null), points (bigint, not null), wins (bigint, not null)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all years and wins for 250cc
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' ORDER BY year;
- Result (excerpt):
  1960: 0 wins; 1961: 0; 1962: 0; 1964: 0; 1965: 0; 1966: 0; 1967: 0; 1970: 0; 1971: 0
- Interpretation: No season in 250cc shows any win, including 1971.

2) Check for exactly 2 wins in 250cc
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' AND wins = 2 ORDER BY year;
- Result: No rows
- Interpretation: There is no year in 250cc with exactly 2 wins.

3) Check for at least 2 wins in 250cc
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' AND wins >= 2 ORDER BY year;
- Result: No rows
- Interpretation: There is no year in 250cc with two or more wins.

4) Cross-check 1971 records by class
- Executed SQL (distinct classes):
  SELECT DISTINCT class FROM public.alberto_pagani;
- Executed SQL (1971 rows):
  SELECT year, class, wins, points, team FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE year = 1971;
- Result (1971 rows):
  • 125cc: wins 0, points 4, team Derbi
  • 250cc: wins 0, points 0, team Suzuki
  • 500cc: wins 1, points 29, team Linto
  • 500cc: wins 1, points 29, team MV Agusta
- Interpretation: Confirms 0 wins in 250cc in 1971.

5) Direct check for any 250cc wins ever
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE class = '250cc' AND wins > 0;
- Result: No rows
- Interpretation: No 250cc wins recorded at all.

Assessment
- The data contradicts the claim. Alberto Pagani did not record two wins in the 250cc class in 1971, nor any wins in that class in any year per the available dataset. The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “win 2 time in the same year, in the 250cc class” as two Grand Prix race wins in the 250cc class within a single season.
- Assumed the table public.alberto_pagani comprehensively captures Alberto Pagani’s seasonal class results and win counts.
