Summary
- I explored the available data sources, identified a single table (public.cube_film_series), examined its schema, and queried it to verify the claim about the female characters’ statuses.

Data source discovery
- Database: public
- Table: cube_film_series
- Columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text)

Executed evidence queries and results
1) List female characters and their statuses
SQL:
SELECT name, status FROM cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female';
Results:
- Joan Leaven | Dead
- Dr. Helen Holloway | Dead

2) Count total female characters
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_female_characters FROM cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female';
Result:
- total_female_characters = 2

3) Count female characters with status 'dead' (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS dead_female_characters FROM cube_film_series WHERE gender = 'female' AND LOWER(status) = 'dead';
Result:
- dead_female_characters = 2

Conclusion
- The data show there are exactly two female characters in the cube_film_series table, and both have status Dead. This directly supports the claim that both female characters in The Cube have a status of dead.

Assumptions
- “the cube” refers to the characters represented in the public.cube_film_series table (which contains the characters Joan Leaven and Dr. Helen Holloway). 
- Status comparison was treated case-insensitively (Dead vs dead).
