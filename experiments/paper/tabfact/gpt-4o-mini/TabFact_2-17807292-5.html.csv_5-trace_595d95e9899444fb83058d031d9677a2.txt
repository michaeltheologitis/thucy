Claim to verify: “charlie wi and aaron baddeley be from the united state.”

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a table public.t_2008_pga_championship containing player names and their countries.

Schema evidence
- Table: public.t_2008_pga_championship
  - Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text)

Executed queries and results
1) Attempt exact-name lookup (no rows found, suggesting minor name formatting differences in the dataset):
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT player, country FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player = 'Charlie Wi' OR player = 'Aaron Baddeley';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Fuzzy/substring lookup (found both players with recorded countries):
SQL:
SELECT player, country FROM t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Baddeley%' OR player ILIKE '%Wi%';
Results:
- Player: Aaron Baddeley, Country: Australia
- Player: Charlie Wi, Country: South Korea

Assessment
- The authoritative dataset lists Aaron Baddeley as Australia and Charlie Wi as South Korea.
- Therefore, the claim that both are from the United States is contradicted by the data.

Answer: Neither Charlie Wi nor Aaron Baddeley is listed as being from the United States in the dataset; they are from South Korea and Australia, respectively.

Assumptions
- “From the United States” is interpreted as the player’s country as recorded in the dataset’s country field for the 2008 PGA Championship context.
