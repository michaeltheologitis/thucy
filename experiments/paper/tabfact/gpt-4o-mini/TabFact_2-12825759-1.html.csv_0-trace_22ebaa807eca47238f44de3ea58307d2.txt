- Purpose: Retrieve all matches at venues containing "Stoop" to check dates and scores.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, venue, opponent, result, tournament, scored 
  FROM public.craig_hall_rugby_league_born_1988 
  WHERE venue ILIKE '%Stoop%';
- Returned rows (relevant excerpt):
  - Date: 28 March 2009 | Venue: Twickenham Stoop | Opponent: Harlequins RL | Result: 22 - 12 | Tournament: Super League | Scored: 1

Assessment:

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data.
