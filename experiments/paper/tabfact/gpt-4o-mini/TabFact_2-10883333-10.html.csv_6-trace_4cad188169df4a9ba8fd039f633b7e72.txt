Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the accessible dataset (six VFL matches on 7 June 1975), North Melbourne recorded the highest away score, not the second-highest.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with a single table public.t_1975_vfl_season (1975 VFL match data for one round).

Schema details
- Columns: "home team" (text), "home team score" (text), "away team" (text), "away team score" (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

Dataset scope check
- Total matches: 6
- Distinct dates: 1 (7 June 1975)
SQL (count matches):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
SQL (distinct dates):
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_dates_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season ORDER BY date LIMIT 20;

Score format confirmation (sample rows)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" 
FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season 
LIMIT 10;
Observed format: e.g., 17.19 (121) where the number in parentheses is total points.

Away-team scoring leaderboard (parsed total points from parentheses)
SQL:
SELECT
    "away team",
    REGEXP_REPLACE(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\(([^)]+)\)'), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int AS parsed_total_points,
    "home team",
    date,
    DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY REGEXP_REPLACE(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\(([^)]+)\)'), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int DESC) as dense_rank,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY REGEXP_REPLACE(SUBSTRING("away team score" FROM '\(([^)]+)\)'), '[^0-9]', '', 'g')::int DESC) as row_number 
FROM
    public.t_1975_vfl_season
ORDER BY
    parsed_total_points DESC,
    "away team";

Result (away team, total points, home team, date, dense rank):
- north melbourne, 121, st kilda, 7 june 1975, rank 1
- carlton, 106, fitzroy, 7 june 1975, rank 2
- melbourne, 98, geelong, 7 june 1975, rank 3
- collingwood, 89, hawthorn, 7 june 1975, rank 4
- south melbourne, 87, footscray, 7 june 1975, rank 5
- essendon, 81, richmond, 7 june 1975, rank 6

Finding
- North Melbourne’s away score (121) is the highest among all away teams in this dataset, not the second highest.

Assumptions and scope
- The claim was interpreted against the only available data (six matches on 7 June 1975). If the intent was broader (e.g., entire 1975 season or all-time), such data is not present in the accessible source, so the verification is limited to the provided dataset.
