Claim to verify: "the volume that have 1 disc, 4 episode, and a region 1 of may 30 , 2006 be volume 5"

Data sources and schema used
- Database: TabFact
- Table: my_info_table
- Columns: volume (bigint), discs (bigint), episodes (bigint), "region 1" (text), "region 2" (text), "region 4" (text)

Evidence
1) Identify all entries with 1 disc and 4 episodes
SQL executed:
SELECT volume, discs, episodes, "region 1" 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE discs = 1 AND episodes = 4;

Result:
- volume: 1 | discs: 1 | episodes: 4 | region 1: january 31 , 2006
- volume: 2 | discs: 1 | episodes: 4 | region 1: march 28 , 2006
- volume: 3 | discs: 1 | episodes: 4 | region 1: may 30 , 2006
- volume: 4 | discs: 1 | episodes: 4 | region 1: july 18 , 2006
- volume: 5 | discs: 1 | episodes: 4 | region 1: september 19 , 2006

2) Directly confirm which volume matches region 1 = "may 30 , 2006" (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT volume FROM my_info_table WHERE discs = 1 AND episodes = 4 AND lower("region 1") = 'may 30 , 2006';

Result:
- volume: 3

Conclusion
- The data show that the volume with 1 disc, 4 episodes, and region 1 date of "may 30 , 2006" is volume 3, not volume 5.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "region 1 of may 30 , 2006" as the exact date string stored in the "region 1" column, matched case-insensitively and with the same punctuation/spacing as stored in the data.
- The claim pertains to the my_info_table dataset described above.
