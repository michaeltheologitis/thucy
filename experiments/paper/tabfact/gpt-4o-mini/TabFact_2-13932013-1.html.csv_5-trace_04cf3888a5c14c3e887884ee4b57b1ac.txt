Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks.

Schema snapshot (relevant fields)
- quarterback (text)
- uniform no (s) (text)
- games started (bigint)
- wins (bigint)
- losses (bigint)
- ties (bigint)
- winning pct (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieved quarterback names and games started (then filtered for the two players of interest):
SQL:
SELECT "quarterback", "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;

Key rows from the result used for verification:
- Brian Sipe — games started: 112
- Bernie Kosar — games started: 105

Computation
- Difference (Sipe minus Kosar) = 112 − 105 = 7

Conclusion
- The claim that “Brian Sipe started 8 more games than Bernie Kosar” is not supported by the data. He started 7 more games, not 8.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “start … game” as games started for the Cleveland Browns, consistent with the scope of the table (list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks).
