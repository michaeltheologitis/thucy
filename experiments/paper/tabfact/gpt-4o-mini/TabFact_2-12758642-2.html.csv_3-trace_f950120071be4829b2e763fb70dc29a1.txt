Summary
- I verified whether there is a match in Saitama, Japan with a bout time of 1:44 and whether its listed record is 19 - 9 - 4, using the available database table (public.katsuya_inoue).

Data source discovery
- Available source: a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.katsuya_inoue.

Schema inspection
- Columns in public.katsuya_inoue were retrieved via:
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'katsuya_inoue';

- Resulting columns:
  - res (text)
  - record (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - method (text)
  - event (text)
  - round (bigint)
  - time (text)
  - location (text)

Evidence queries and results
1) Check all bouts in Saitama, Japan
SQL:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location 
FROM public.katsuya_inoue 
WHERE location ILIKE '%Saitama%';

Results:
- Event: gcm - cage force ex; Location: saitama , japan; Method: draw; Opponent: mizuto hirota; Record: 18 - 6 - 4; Result: draw; Round: 3; Time: 5:00
- Event: dream3; Location: saitama , japan; Method: tko (corner stoppage); Opponent: nick diaz; Record: 16 - 6 - 3; Result: loss; Round: 1; Time: 6:45

Observation: There is no Saitama bout with time 1:44 in this table.

2) Check all bouts with time 1:44 (any location)
SQL:
SELECT res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE time = '1:44' OR time LIKE '%1:44%';

Result:
- Result: loss; Record: 19 - 9 - 4; Opponent: Naoyuki Kotani; Method: submission (armbar); Event: pancrase - impressive tour 9; Round: 1; Time: 1:44; Location: Tokyo, Japan

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset, there is no match in Saitama, Japan with a time of 1:44.
- The only bout with time 1:44 in the table has the record 19 - 9 - 4 and took place in Tokyo, Japan, not Saitama.

Therefore, the claim that a match in Saitama, Japan with a time of 1:44 has a record of 19 - 9 - 4 is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Record” is interpreted as the wins-losses-draws string stored in the record column for that bout entry.
- “Time” refers to the bout end time stored in the time column.
- The verification is scoped to the available dataset (public.katsuya_inoue), which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
