Summary conclusion: The claim that when the value in the 'from' field is 830 BC, the corresponding 'state' is 'wey' is not supported by the data. The dataset shows that 'from' = 830 bc corresponds to the state 'song', and the entry for state 'wey' has 'from' = 855 bc.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc (historical leaders around the 820s BC timeframe).

Schema used (as reported by the schema tool):
- Columns: state (text), type (text), name (text), title (text), royal house (text), from (text). No primary keys/constraints.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Check for an exact match where "from" = '830 BC'
SQL: SELECT * FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE "from" = '830 BC';
Result: No rows returned.

2) Search for any entries where the "from" field contains 830 (to capture variations like '830 bc')
SQL: SELECT state, name, title, "royal house", "from" FROM list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE "from" LIKE '%830%';
Result: state = song; name = hui; title = duke; royal house = -; from = 830 bc.
Interpretation: The row with 'from' = 830 bc corresponds to state 'song', not 'wey'.

3) Verify what the dataset lists for state 'wey'
SQL: SELECT state, name, title, "royal house", "from" FROM public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc WHERE state = 'wey';
Result: state = wey; name = li; title = marquis; royal house = -; from = 855 bc.
Interpretation: The 'wey' entry in this dataset starts at 855 bc, not 830 bc.

Conclusion: When 'from' is 830 bc, the associated state in this dataset is 'song', not 'wey'. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the columns 'from' and 'state' in the table public.list_of_state_leaders_in_820s_bc, and the year format is taken as stored (e.g., '830 bc').
