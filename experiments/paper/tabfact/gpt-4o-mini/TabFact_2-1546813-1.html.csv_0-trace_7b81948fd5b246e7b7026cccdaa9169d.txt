Claim: “the solheim cup be host in the us on 7 occasions from 1990 through 2013.”

Summary conclusion: Verified. The data show 7 U.S.-hosted Solheim Cups between 1990 and 2013 inclusive: 1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009, and 2013.

Data discovery and schema
- Discovered database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: solheim_cup
- Columns: year (bigint), venue (text), winning team (text), score (text), usa captain (text), europe captain (text)

Evidence 1: List all editions (1990–2013) with venues
- Executed SQL (exact):
  SELECT year, venue FROM solheim_cup WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013;
- Results (year → venue):
  2013 → “colorado golf club , colorado , usa”
  2011 → “killeen castle golf resort , ireland”
  2009 → “rich harvest farms , illinois , usa”
  2007 → “halmstad gk , sweden”
  2005 → “crooked stick golf club , indiana , usa”
  2003 → “barsebäck golf & country club , sweden”
  2002 → “interlachen country club , minnesota , usa”
  2000 → “loch lomond golf club , scotland”
  1998 → “muirfield village , ohio , usa”
  1996 → “st pierre golf & country club , wales”
  1994 → “the greenbrier , west virginia , usa”
  1992 → “dalmahoy country club , scotland”
  1990 → “lake nona golf & country club , florida , usa”

Evidence 2: Count U.S.-hosted editions (venue contains “usa”) in 1990–2013
- Executed SQL (exact):
  1) SELECT COUNT(year) as count, ARRAY_AGG(year) AS years
     FROM public.solheim_cup
     WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND venue ILIKE '%usa%';
  2) SELECT year
     FROM public.solheim_cup
     WHERE year BETWEEN 1990 AND 2013 AND venue ILIKE '%usa%';
- Results:
  Count = 7
  Years = {1990, 1994, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2009, 2013}

Conclusion based on evidence
- There are exactly seven editions hosted in the USA within 1990–2013 inclusive. This matches the claim.

Assumptions
- Host country was determined by the presence of “usa” in the venue text field, which is consistently populated in this dataset for U.S. venues.
- The range “from 1990 through 2013” is interpreted as inclusive of both 1990 and 2013.
