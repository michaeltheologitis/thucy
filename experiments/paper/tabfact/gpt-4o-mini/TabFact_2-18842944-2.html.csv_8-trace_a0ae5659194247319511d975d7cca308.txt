Claim to verify: "the attendance in week 12 be higher than the attendance in week 6 and 13"

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season
- Table schema:
  - week (bigint)
  - date (text)
  - opponent (text)
  - result (text)
  - attendance (bigint)

Evidence
1) Retrieve attendance for weeks 6, 12, and 13
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE week IN (6, 12, 13) ORDER BY week ASC;
Results:
- Week 6: 71,009
- Week 12: 66,875
- Week 13: 43,475

2) Boolean check: Is week 12 attendance strictly greater than both week 6 and week 13?
Executed SQLs:
SELECT attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE week = 12;  -- 66,875
SELECT attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE week = 6;   -- 71,009
SELECT attendance FROM public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season WHERE week = 13;  -- 43,475
SELECT (66875 > 71009 AND 66875 > 43475) AS is_week12_highest_among_6_12_13;  -- false

Assessment
- Week 12 (66,875) is lower than Week 6 (71,009) but higher than Week 13 (43,475).
- Therefore, the statement that week 12 attendance is higher than both week 6 and week 13 is not satisfied.

Conclusion
- Week 12 > Week 13: true
- Week 12 > Week 6: false
- Overall claim: not met.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the only available dataset (1976 Buffalo Bills season), with "attendance" and "week" mapped to the respective columns in public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season.
- "Higher than" is interpreted as strictly greater than.
