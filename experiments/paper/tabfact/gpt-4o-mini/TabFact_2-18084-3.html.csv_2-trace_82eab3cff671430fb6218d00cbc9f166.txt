Claim to verify: “only 4 of the athlete have a mark greater than 29 foot.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: long_jump
- Table schema (from discovery):
  - mark (TEXT)
  - wind (DOUBLE PRECISION)
  - athlete (TEXT)
  - nationality (TEXT)
  - venue (TEXT)
  - date (TEXT)

Understanding the data format
- We first inspected sample rows to understand how marks are recorded. The mark column stores distances as meters with a feet+inches equivalent in parentheses (e.g., “8.95 m (29ft4¼in)”).

Executed SQL (format check)
SELECT * FROM long_jump LIMIT 20;

Observed sample output (abridged):
- mike powell | august 30 , 1991 | 8.95 m (29ft4¼in) | united states | tokyo | 0.3
- bob beamon | october 18 , 1968 | 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a | united states | mexico city | 2
- carl lewis | august 30 , 1991 | 8.87 m (29ft1in) | united states | tokyo | 0.2
- robert emmiyan | may 22 , 1987 | 8.86 m (29ft0¾in) a | soviet union | tsakhkadzor | 1.9

Verification approach
- We parse the numeric meters from mark, convert to feet (feet = meters × 3.28084), and determine, per athlete, whether any recorded mark exceeds 29.00 feet. We then count distinct athletes meeting this criterion and list them.

Executed SQL (athletes and their best feet; threshold > 29 feet)
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(mark FROM '([0-9.]+)') AS DOUBLE PRECISION) * 3.28084) AS best_mark
FROM long_jump
GROUP BY athlete
HAVING MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(mark FROM '([0-9.]+)') AS DOUBLE PRECISION) * 3.28084) > 29;

Result (athletes with best mark > 29 ft):
- Mike Powell — Best Mark ≈ 29.36 ft
- Bob Beamon — Best Mark ≈ 29.20 ft
- Carl Lewis — Best Mark ≈ 29.10 ft
- Robert Emmiyan — Best Mark ≈ 29.07 ft

Executed SQL (cross-check: count distinct athletes over 29 ft across all rows)
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT athlete) AS total_athletes
FROM long_jump
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(mark FROM '([0-9.]+)') AS DOUBLE PRECISION) * 3.28084 > 29;

Result: 4

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 4 distinct athletes have a mark strictly greater than 29 feet. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Greater than 29 foot” is interpreted as strictly greater than 29.00 feet (> 29.00), not ≥ 29.00.
- We evaluate distinct athletes (not number of performances) and use each athlete’s best recorded mark in the dataset.
- We convert meters (extracted from the mark text) to feet using 1 m = 3.28084 ft and ignore the feet+inches substring for computation to avoid parsing fractional inch glyphs.
