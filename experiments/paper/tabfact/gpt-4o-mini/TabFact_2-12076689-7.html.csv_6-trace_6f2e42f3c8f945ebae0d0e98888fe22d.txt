Claim to verify: “all game in the 2007 season be play in the month of october.”

What I checked
- Explored the connected database to find any tables covering the 2007 season or game logs with 2007 dates.

Data source discovery and evidence
1) Inventory of user tables
Result: Only one user table found: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season (no 2007 season table present).
SQL executed:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema');

2) Search for any table names mentioning 2007
Result: No tables with names containing “2007”.
SQL executed:
SELECT table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name LIKE '%2007%';

Conclusion
- The connected database contains only a 2006 Texas Rangers season table and no data for the 2007 season. Therefore, I cannot evaluate whether all 2007 season games were played in October using the available data. The claim is unsupported by the evidence in this environment.

Assumptions and notes
- I assumed that verifying the claim requires access to game logs (with dates) for the 2007 season. The current database does not include any 2007 data, so no further verification is possible here. If a dataset with 2007 season games is provided, I can rerun the verification precisely.
