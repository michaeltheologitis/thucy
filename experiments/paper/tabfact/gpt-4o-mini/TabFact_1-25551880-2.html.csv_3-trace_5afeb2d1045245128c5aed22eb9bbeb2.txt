Summary
Based on the 2010 Vuelta a España dataset (table t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a), the mountains classification leader for each stage appears as a text value. Counting appearances per name across all stages shows that Mickaël Delage appears exactly once. The only other value that appears exactly once is a non-person placeholder (“Not Awarded”). No other rider appears exactly once. Therefore, Mickaël Delage is the only person with a single appearance in the mountains classification within this dataset.

Evidence
1) Frequency of each mountains classification entry across stages
Executed SQL:
SELECT "mountains classification", COUNT(*) as stage_count 
FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a 
WHERE "mountains classification" IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY "mountains classification";

Result (as returned):
- Mickaël Delage — 1 stage
- Serafín Martínez — 6 stages
- David Moncoutié — 13 stages
- Not Awarded — 1 stage

2) Values appearing exactly once in mountains classification
Executed SQL:
SELECT "mountains classification", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a
GROUP BY "mountains classification"
HAVING COUNT(*) = 1;

Result (as returned):
- not awarded — Count: 1
- mickaël delage — Count: 1

Conclusion
- Among people (riders), Mickaël Delage is the only one who appears exactly once in the mountains classification column for the 2010 Vuelta a España stages. The other single-occurrence entry is “Not Awarded,” which is not a person.

Assumptions
- “Person” refers to actual riders and excludes placeholder or administrative values such as “Not Awarded.”
- The scope is the 2010 Vuelta a España stages as represented in table t_2010_vuelta_a_espa_a, where the mountains classification column denotes the jersey holder per stage.
