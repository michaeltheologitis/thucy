Claim: “6 game have an attendance of over 7000 during the 1993 New York Jet season.”

Finding: The data shows all 16 games in the 1993 New York Jets season had attendance greater than 7,000.

Evidence from database (public schema):

1) Total number of games
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
- Result: 16

2) Count of games with attendance > 7000
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS attendance_above_7000 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE attendance > 7000;
- Result: 16

3) Count of games with attendance <= 7000
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS attendance_7000_or_below 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE attendance <= 7000;
- Result: 0

4) All games with week and attendance (for transparency)
- SQL:
  SELECT week, attendance 
  FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  ORDER BY week ASC;
- Result (week: attendance):
  - 1: 68130
  - 2: 70314
  - 4: 64836
  - 5: 72593
  - 6: 41627
  - 8: 71541
  - 9: 71659
  - 10: 71306
  - 11: 47351
  - 12: 64264
  - 13: 42810
  - 14: 45799
  - 15: 47970
  - 16: 73233
  - 17: 70817
  - 18: 61040

Conclusion: The claim is not supported. There were 16 games with attendance over 7,000, not 6.

Assumptions:
- “1993 New York Jet season” refers to the regular-season games represented in table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season.
- “Over 7000” is interpreted as attendance > 7000 (strictly greater than 7,000).
