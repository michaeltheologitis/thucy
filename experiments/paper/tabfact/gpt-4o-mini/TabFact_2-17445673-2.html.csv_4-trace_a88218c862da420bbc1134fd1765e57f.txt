Claim interpreted: The match with the longest time was a win against Eugene Jackson.

What I checked
- I examined all bouts in the available dataset (public.tim_lajcik) and computed each bout’s duration in seconds from the time column (assumed mm:ss). I then sorted by the computed duration to identify the longest match.

Evidence
1) Query to compute durations and sort descending
SQL executed:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, method, time, 
    (split_part(time, ':', 1)::int * 60 + split_part(time, ':', 2)::int) AS duration_in_seconds
FROM public.tim_lajcik 
WHERE time ~ '^\d{1,2}:\d{2}$' 
ORDER BY duration_in_seconds DESC, round DESC 
LIMIT 100;

Result (top rows shown):
- win | eugene jackson | ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2 | round 1 | submission (rear naked choke) | time 9:49 | duration 589
- win | mark tullius | ng 9 - neutral grounds 9 | round 1 | submission (strikes) | time 6:58 | duration 418
- win | david ross | ifc wc 2 - warriors challenge 2 | round 1 | tko | time 5:36 | duration 336
- draw | ron waterman | ufc 22 | round 3 | draw | time 5:00 | duration 300
- win | osami shibuya | pancrase - 2001 neo - blood tournament second round | round 3 | decision (unanimous) | time 5:00 | duration 300
- loss | tsuyoshi kohsaka | ufc 21 | round 2 | tko (corner stoppage) | time 5:00 | duration 300
- loss | jeff monson | ufc 27 | round 2 | decision | time 5:00 | duration 300
(Additional rows follow with shorter durations.)

Finding
- The longest-duration fight in the table is 9:49 (589 seconds), and it is a win against Eugene Jackson.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim that the match with the longest time was a win against Eugene Jackson.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the fights contained in the available dataset (public.tim_lajcik).
- “Longest time” is interpreted as the maximum value of the time column (parsed as mm:ss) across all rows in this table.
- Case-insensitive matching of names is acceptable (the dataset stores names in lowercase).
