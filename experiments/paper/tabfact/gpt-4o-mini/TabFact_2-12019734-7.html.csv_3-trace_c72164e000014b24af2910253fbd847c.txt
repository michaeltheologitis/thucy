Claim interpreted: There exists a game where the record is “11 - 35 - 12,” the home team is St Louis, and the opponent is New Jersey.

Data source discovery:
- Database: TabFact, Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table(date text, visitor text, score text, home text, record text)

Step 1 — Strict match check (no result):
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
FROM my_info_table
WHERE home = 'St Louis'
  AND visitor = 'New Jersey'
  AND record SIMILAR TO '11\s*-\s*35\s*-\s*12'
Result: 0 rows

Step 2 — Case-insensitive, flexible spacing/name variants (match found):
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE (home ILIKE '%st louis%' OR home ILIKE '%st. louis%') 
AND visitor ILIKE '%new jersey%' 
AND (record ILIKE '%11-35-12%' OR record ILIKE '%11 - 35 - 12%' OR record ILIKE '%11 35 12%') 
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- Date: February 12; Visitor: New Jersey; Score: 1 - 5; Home: St Louis; Record: 11 - 35 - 12

Conclusion: The data contains a game where the record is “11 - 35 - 12,” the home team is St Louis, and the opponent is New Jersey. This supports the claim.

Assumptions:
- “Record” refers to the record field in my_info_table as stored for the row.
- “Against New Jersey” implies the opponent (visitor) is New Jersey while St Louis is the home team.
- Team name variations (e.g., “St Louis” vs “St. Louis”) are considered equivalent for matching.
