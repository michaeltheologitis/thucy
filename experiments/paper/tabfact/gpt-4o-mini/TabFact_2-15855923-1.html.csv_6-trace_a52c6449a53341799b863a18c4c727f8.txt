Summary conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. The only match with a score of 4 - 1 in the available data was played in Seoul, South Korea, and its recorded result is also 4 - 1—not 2 - 1. The only match in London, England has a score/result of 2 - 0.

Evidence and executed SQL:

1) Sample of the table to understand data values
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.kwak_tae_hwi LIMIT 20;
- Observations from sample: Includes a match on October 15, 2008 with score 4 - 1 and venue Seoul, South Korea; and a Friendly on March 3, 2010 in London, England with score/result 2 - 0; and a match on June 8, 2012 with result 4 - 1 and score 2 - 1 in Doha, Qatar.

2) Identify all matches with score = '4 - 1'
- SQL: SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '4 - 1'
- Result: Date: October 15, 2008; Competition: 2010 World Cup Qualification; Venue: Seoul, South Korea; Score: 4 - 1; Result: 4 - 1.

3) Count of matches with score = '4 - 1'
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '4 - 1';
- Result: 1 match.

4) Check for London, England matches
- SQL: SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE venue ILIKE '%London%' AND venue ILIKE '%England%';
- Result: Date: March 3, 2010; Competition: Friendly; Venue: London, England; Score: 2 - 0; Result: 2 - 0.

5) Test whether any match has score = '4 - 1' and result = '2 - 1'
- SQL: SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '4 - 1' AND result = '2 - 1';
- Result: No records returned.

6) Test whether any match has score = '4 - 1' and was played in London, England
- SQL: SELECT date, competition, venue, score, result FROM kwak_tae_hwi WHERE score = '4 - 1' AND venue ILIKE '%London%' AND venue ILIKE '%England%';
- Result: No records returned.

Conclusion details:
- The only 4 - 1 score match in this dataset was played in Seoul, South Korea, and its result is 4 - 1 (not 2 - 1).
- The only match in London, England has a 2 - 0 score/result (not 4 - 1 and not 2 - 1).

Assumptions made:
- "game with a 4 - 1 score" refers to rows where the score column equals the literal string '4 - 1'.
- "result" refers to the result column in the same row.
- "venue be london , england" refers to the venue column text indicating London, England, regardless of spacing or case.
