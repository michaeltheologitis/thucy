Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: public.west_berkshire_brewery
- Columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)

Evidence retrieved
Query objective: Retrieve all award entries for Dr Hexter’s Healer (including minor name variations) between 1995 and 2009.

SQL executed:
SELECT year, "beer name", prize, category, competition 
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery 
WHERE ("beer name" ILIKE '%Dr Hexter%Healer%') 
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009 
ORDER BY year;

Results:
- 1997 | dr hexter 's healer | runner up | beer of the festival | camra northamptonshire branch beer festival
- 2002 | dr hexter 's healer | silver medal | strong ale | siba south east region beer competition
- 2008 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | best local beer | camra reading branch beer festival
- 2009 | dr hexter 's healer | gold medal | in category | camra london and south east regional competition

Assessment
- Within 1995–2009, Dr Hexter’s Healer did receive a silver medal (2002), but it also received multiple gold medals (2008, 2009) and a runner-up mention (1997).
- Therefore, it is not true that the beer “only” received a silver medal in that period.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data. Dr Hexter’s Healer received gold medals in 2008 and 2009 in addition to a silver medal in 2002.

Assumptions
- “Only received a silver medal between 1995 and 2009” is interpreted to mean that, during this period, the beer did not receive any medal other than silver. Name matching used a case-insensitive search for entries containing both “Dr Hexter” and “Healer,” which captures common naming variations including apostrophes.
