Claim to verify: "bridgenorth have the highest number of win in the ntfa div with 15 win and only 3 loss"

Step 1: Inspect standings to see who has the most wins
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "ntfa div 1", wins, losses 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  ORDER BY wins DESC, losses ASC;
- Key results (top to bottom by wins):
  bridgenorth: 15 wins, 3 losses
  rocherlea: 13 wins, 5 losses
  bracknell: 12 wins, 5 losses
  george town: 9 wins, 8 losses
  scottsdale: 8 wins, 10 losses
  deloraine: 6 wins, 10 losses
  longford: 5 wins, 12 losses
  hillwood: 1 win, 16 losses
- Finding: Bridgenorth is at the top with 15 wins and 3 losses.

Step 2: Confirm Bridgenorth’s exact record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE "ntfa div 1" ILIKE 'Bridgenorth';
- Result: Wins = 15, Losses = 3, Byes = 0, Draws = 0, Against = 1247
- Finding: Bridgenorth has 15 wins and 3 losses.

Step 3: Verify that 15 is the maximum wins and whether any other team matches it
- Executed SQL (max wins):
  SELECT MAX(wins) AS max_wins FROM public.my_info_table;
  Result: max_wins = 15
- Executed SQL (teams with max wins):
  SELECT "ntfa div 1", wins FROM public.my_info_table WHERE wins = 15;
  Result: bridgenorth (15 wins)
- Finding: 15 is the maximum wins, and Bridgenorth is the only team with that total.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim. Bridgenorth has the highest number of wins (15) in NTFA Div 1 and a record showing only 3 losses.

Assumptions
- "ntfa div" refers to NTFA Division 1, corresponding to column "ntfa div 1" in the dataset.
