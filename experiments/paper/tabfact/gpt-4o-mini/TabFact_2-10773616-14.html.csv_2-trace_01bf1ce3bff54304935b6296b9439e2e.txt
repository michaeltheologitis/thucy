Claim to verify: “the away team's score at the game when Hawthorn was the home team was 9.11 (65).”

Data sources explored:
- Database: public schema
- Table: public.t_1954_vfl_season (authoritative dataset for the 1954 VFL season)
  - Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Identify which clubs appear as home teams in this dataset
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season;
Result:
- Collingwood
- Carlton
- Melbourne
- Geelong
- South Melbourne
- North Melbourne
Observation: Hawthorn does not appear as a home team in this table.

2) Directly search for any match where Hawthorn is the home team
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score" 
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
WHERE "home team" = 'Hawthorn';
Result: No rows returned.
Observation: There are no matches recorded with Hawthorn as the home team in this dataset.

3) Check if any match in the dataset has an away team score of exactly '9.11 (65)'
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
WHERE "away team score" = '9.11 (65)';
Result: No rows returned.
Observation: The score string '9.11 (65)' does not occur as an away team score in this table.

Conclusion:
- The dataset for the 1954 VFL season contains no games where Hawthorn is the home team, and no away team scores recorded as 9.11 (65). Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available authoritative data.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1954 VFL season contained in public.t_1954_vfl_season.
- “Hawthorn” refers to the Hawthorn Football Club as represented in the dataset’s team name fields.
- Score formatting in the dataset matches the example (goals.behinds (total points)).
