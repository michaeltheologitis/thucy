Summary
- Interpreted claim: There exists a row in the html5_video table where "vp8 ( webm )" = 6.0 and "vp9 ( webm )" = 29.0, and under that condition the operating system is "window" (interpreted as "windows").

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact
- Table: public.html5_video
- Columns: browser (text), operating system (text), latest stable release (text), theora (text), h264 (text), vp8 ( webm ) (text), vp9 ( webm ) (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Find rows where VP8=6.0 and VP9=29.0
SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system", "vp8 ( webm )", "vp9 ( webm )" 
FROM public.html5_video 
WHERE "vp8 ( webm )" = '6.0' AND "vp9 ( webm )" = '29.0';
Result:
- browser: Google Chrome
- operating system: 30.0.1599.101 (October 15, 2013)
- vp8 ( webm ): 6.0
- vp9 ( webm ): 29.0

2) Retrieve full row for context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE "vp8 ( webm )" = '6.0' AND "vp9 ( webm )" = '29.0';
Result:
- browser: google chrome
- operating system: 30.0.1599.101 (october 15 , 2013 )
- latest stable release: 30.0.1599.101 (october 15 , 2013 )
- theora: 3.0
- h264: 3.0
- vp8 ( webm ): 6.0
- vp9 ( webm ): 29.0

3) Count rows with VP8=6.0 and VP9=29.0
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.html5_video WHERE "vp8 ( webm )" = '6.0' AND "vp9 ( webm )" = '29.0';
Result: 1 row

4) Check if any such row has operating system = 'windows'
SQL:
SELECT browser, "operating system"
FROM public.html5_video
WHERE "vp8 ( webm )" = '6.0' AND "vp9 ( webm )" = '29.0' AND "operating system" = 'windows';
Result: 0 rows

5) Distinct operating system values (to confirm 'windows' exists as a value)
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT "operating system" FROM public.html5_video;
Result includes: windows; ios; android; macos x; windows phone; windows rt; all supported; 30.0.1599.101 (october 15, 2013)

Conclusion
- The only row where "vp8 ( webm )" = 6.0 and "vp9 ( webm )" = 29.0 has operating system = "30.0.1599.101 (october 15, 2013)", not "windows". No row satisfies the condition with operating system = 'windows'. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "window" as the operating system label "windows" (case-insensitive).
