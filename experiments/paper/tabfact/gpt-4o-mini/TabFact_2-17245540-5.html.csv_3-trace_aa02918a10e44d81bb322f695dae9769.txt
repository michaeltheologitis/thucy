Assessment of the claim

- “and finished in T6” — Supported by the dataset for the 1973 U.S. Open (place: T6).

Conclusion: Both parts of the claim are supported by the available data.

Assumptions
- The claim is evaluated specifically against the 1973 U.S. Open data because that is the authoritative dataset available in the connected data environment.
