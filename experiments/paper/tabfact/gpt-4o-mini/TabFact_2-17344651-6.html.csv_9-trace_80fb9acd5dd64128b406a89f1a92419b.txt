Schema inspection
- Table: t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season (game bigint, date text, opponent text, score text, location text, record text). The location column indicates venue (e.g., “boston garden”). The score column appears to be "CelticsPoints - OpponentPoints".
- Tool evidence (schema):
  (No SQL – schema info retrieved via schema tool.)

Evidence from queries
1) Sample inspection (to understand formats)
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season LIMIT 10;
Result highlight: Includes multiple Boston Garden games. Example: Wed Jan 23 at boston garden vs seattle supersonics with score 97 - 107 (a home loss for Boston), and Wed Jan 9 vs chicago bulls with score 111 - 108 (a home win for Boston).

2) Identify Boston Garden home losses in the dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record 
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season 
WHERE location ILIKE '%boston garden%' 
  AND (split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int < split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int);
Result:
- Date: Wed Jan 23, Opponent: seattle supersonics, Score: 97 - 107, Record: 34 - 8.
Distinct opponents who beat Boston at Boston Garden in this dataset:
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT opponent 
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season 
WHERE location ILIKE '%boston garden%' 
  AND (split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int < split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int);
Result: seattle supersonics.
Interpretation: In the available data, the only recorded home loss at Boston Garden was to the Seattle Supersonics—not the Chicago Bulls.

3) Check Boston Garden games vs the Chicago Bulls
SQL executed:
SELECT date, score,
    CASE
        WHEN CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 1) AS INTEGER) > CAST(split_part(score, ' - ', 2) AS INTEGER) THEN 'Win'
        ELSE 'Loss'
    END AS result
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE opponent = 'chicago bulls' AND location ILIKE '%boston garden%';
Result: Jan 9, 111 - 108, Result: Win (Celtics). Interpretation: The Bulls did not record a win at Boston Garden in the games captured by this dataset.

4) Context on Boston Garden performance within this dataset
SQL executed (counts):
- Home games count:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS home_games
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE location ILIKE '%boston garden%';
Result: 8 home games.
- Wins count:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS wins
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE location ILIKE '%boston garden%'
AND split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int > split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int;
Result: 7 wins.
- Losses count:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS losses
FROM public.t_1984_85_boston_celtics_season
WHERE location ILIKE '%boston garden%'
AND split_part(score, ' - ', 1)::int < split_part(score, ' - ', 2)::int;
Result: 1 loss (to Seattle, as above).

Conclusion
- In the available data (subset of the 1984–85 season), the Celtics’ only recorded home loss at Boston Garden was to the Seattle Supersonics, and the Chicago Bulls did not beat the Celtics at Boston Garden in the captured games. Therefore, the claim that the Bulls are the only team to play the Celtics at Boston Garden and win is contradicted by the evidence here.

Assumptions and scope
- The database exposed to us contains only a partial slice of the 1984–85 season (14 total rows centered around January). The conclusions above are strictly within the scope of this dataset. Broader, all-time verification is not possible with the provided data. Within this dataset, the claim is inaccurate.
