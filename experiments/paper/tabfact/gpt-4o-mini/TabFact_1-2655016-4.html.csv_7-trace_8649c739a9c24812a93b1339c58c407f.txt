Claim to verify: “the episode called Aaliyah was the first episode to air.”

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. The episode titled “aaliyah” is present in the dataset with an original air date of October 4, 1997 and an overall sequence number (series) of 53. The dataset contains earlier-aired episodes, including one on November 16, 1996, and at least 14 episodes with a smaller overall sequence number than 53. Therefore, “aaliyah” was not the first episode to air in this dataset.

Evidence from the database
1) Locate the episode titled “Aaliyah”
- Result: Season 16, Series 53, Episode Title: aaliyah, Original Air Date: October 4, 1997, Nick Prod: 353
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date", "nick prod" 
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%Aaliyah%';

2) Identify the earliest-aired episode in the dataset (by original air date)
- Result: Season 1, Series 38, Episode Title: tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j, Original Air Date: November 16, 1996
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT season, series, "episode title", "original air date"
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE "original air date" IS NOT NULL
  ORDER BY "original air date"::DATE ASC
  LIMIT 1;

3) Show that multiple episodes precede “Aaliyah” by overall sequence number
- Result A: 14 episodes have a smaller series number than 53
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE series < 53;

- Result B: The minimum series below 53 is 38 with title “tia & tamera mowry / ll cool j”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MIN(series) AS min_series, "episode title"
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
  WHERE series < 53
  GROUP BY "episode title"
  ORDER BY min_series
  LIMIT 1;

Assessment
- The episode “aaliyah” (series 53; Oct 4, 1997) is not the first episode to air in the dataset. The dataset includes earlier episodes (e.g., series 38; Nov 16, 1996) and at least 14 episodes with lower sequence numbers than 53.

Assumptions and scope
- Interpreted “the episode called Aaliyah” as the episode whose title field equals/contains “Aaliyah” within the available dataset (public.list_of_all_that_episodes).
- Interpreted “first episode to air” as the earliest original air date and/or smallest overall sequence number within this dataset. All conclusions are grounded strictly in the provided database, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
