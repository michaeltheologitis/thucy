Claim being verified: "game number 72 on march 28 be against cleveland with a score of w 94 - 80 (ot)"

What the data shows (Toronto Raptors 2001–02 season):
- Evidence for game 72:
  - Result: Game 72 was on March 28 vs Atlanta, score W 85 - 83 (OT), not Cleveland and not 94 - 80.
  - Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE game = 72;
  - Returned row summary: Date: March 28; Game: 72; Team: Atlanta; Score: W 85 - 83 (OT); High Points: Antonio Davis, Morris Peterson (15); High Rebounds: Antonio Davis (9); High Assists: Chris Childs (7); Location Attendance: Philips Arena (12,036); Record: 34 - 38.

- Cross-check for March 28 specifically:
  - Executed SQL: SELECT game, score FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE date LIKE '%march 28%';
  - Result: Game 72, score W 85 - 83 (OT), confirming OT and win on that date.

- Evidence for games vs Cleveland and the 94-80 OT score:
  - The 94 - 80 (OT) win occurred against Cleveland on March 22 (Game 69), not March 28.
  - Executed SQL: SELECT date, game, score FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE LOWER(team) LIKE '%cleveland%' ORDER BY date;
  - Result: Date: March 22; Game: 69; Score: W 94 - 80 (OT).
  - Full row verification for game 69:
    - Executed SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_2001_02_toronto_raptors_season WHERE game = 69;
    - Returned row summary: Date: March 22; Opponent: Cleveland; Score: W 94 - 80 (OT); Record: 31 - 38; High Points: Morris Peterson (18); High Rebounds: Keon Clark (10); High Assists: Alvin Williams (4); Location & Attendance: Gund Arena (17,847).

Conclusion:
- True elements: Game 72 took place on March 28; it was a win in overtime.
- Incorrect elements: The opponent was Atlanta (not Cleveland) and the score was W 85 - 83 (OT), not W 94 - 80 (OT). The Cleveland W 94 - 80 (OT) result corresponds to Game 69 on March 22.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Toronto Raptors’ 2001–02 season (the only available data source).
