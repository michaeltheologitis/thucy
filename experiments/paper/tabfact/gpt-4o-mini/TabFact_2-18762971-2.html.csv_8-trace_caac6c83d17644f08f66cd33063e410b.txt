Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Sheffield Wednesday’s matches on 14 April 2001 and 24 February 2001 were both victories.

Data source discovered: A PostgreSQL database for Sheffield Wednesday FC’s 2000–01 season with table t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season (date, opponent, venue, result, attendance).

Step 1 – Establish date format and context
Evidence query:
SQL: SELECT * FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season LIMIT 10;
Observation: Dates are stored as textual strings like “13 august 2000”; results are in the form “SWFC_goals - Opponent_goals” regardless of venue, so a win is when the left value > right value.

Step 2 – Retrieve the two dates in question
Evidence query:
SQL: SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance FROM t_2000_01_sheffield_wednesday_f_c_season WHERE LOWER(date) = LOWER('14 april 2001') OR LOWER(date) = LOWER('24 february 2001');

Results returned:
- 24 February 2001: Opponent = Preston North End, Venue = a, Result = 0 - 2, Attendance = 14379. This is a loss (0 < 2).
- 14 April 2001: Opponent = Crystal Palace, Venue = h, Result = 4 - 1, Attendance = 19877. This is a win (4 > 1).

Conclusion: Only the 14 April 2001 match was a victory. The 24 February 2001 match was a loss. Therefore, the claim that both were victories is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “Match” refers to Sheffield Wednesday FC fixtures recorded in the 2000–01 season table.
- The result field lists Sheffield Wednesday’s goals first, consistent across home and away fixtures, as implied by the dataset examples.
