Claim interpreted: “The player ranked sixth is from South Korea and the note indicates ‘sc / d’.” In this dataset, “player” appears to refer to the entry in my_info_table (rowers). I verified the record with rank = 6 and checked for uniqueness.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public, table: my_info_table(rank bigint, rowers text, country text, time text, notes text).

Evidence 1: Retrieve the row with rank = 6
- Result:
  - Rank: 6
  - Rowers: jang kang - eun, kim hong - kyun
  - Country: south korea
  - Time: 7:12.17
  - Notes: sc / d
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE rank = 6;

Evidence 2: Check uniqueness of rank = 6
- Result: 1 row
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count_rows FROM my_info_table WHERE rank = 6;

Assessment:
- The entry at rank 6 has country = “south korea” and notes = “sc / d”, exactly matching the claim. There is only one such row, so the verification is unambiguous.

Assumptions:
- “Player” refers to the rowers entry in my_info_table. The claim’s phrasing is mapped to the table fields: rank → rank, origin → country, note → notes.
