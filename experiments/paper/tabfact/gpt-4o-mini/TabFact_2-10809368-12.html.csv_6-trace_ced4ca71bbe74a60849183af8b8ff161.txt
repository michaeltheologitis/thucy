Claim to verify: “on 13 july 1946, the home team score 14.8 (92)”.

Summary conclusion: No home team scored 14.8 (92) on 13 july 1946. On that date, one away team (Footscray) scored 14.8 (92) against Essendon. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Evidence from the database (public.t_1946_vfl_season):

1) Identify matches played on 13 july 1946
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd"
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '13 july 1946';

Result rows:
- Home Team: Geelong | Home Team Score: 15.7 (97) | Away Team: Melbourne | Away Team Score: 21.14 (140) | Venue: Kardinia Park | Crowd: 11,500
- Home Team: Essendon | Home Team Score: 16.24 (120) | Away Team: Footscray | Away Team Score: 14.8 (92) | Venue: Windy Hill | Crowd: 29,000
- Home Team: Collingwood | Home Team Score: 15.23 (113) | Away Team: Hawthorn | Away Team Score: 11.14 (80) | Venue: Victoria Park | Crowd: 11,000
- Home Team: Carlton | Home Team Score: 12.13 (85) | Away Team: South Melbourne | Away Team Score: 11.18 (84) | Venue: Princes Park | Crowd: 26,000
- Home Team: St Kilda | Home Team Score: 10.14 (74) | Away Team: North Melbourne | Away Team Score: 12.11 (83) | Venue: Junction Oval | Crowd: 7,000
- Home Team: Richmond | Home Team Score: 14.14 (98) | Away Team: Fitzroy | Away Team Score: 10.12 (72) | Venue: Punt Road Oval | Crowd: 19,000

2) Direct check for any home team scoring exactly 14.8 (92) on that date
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE date = '13 july 1946' AND "home team score" = '14.8 (92)';

Result: 0

3) Corroborate the specific occurrence of 14.8 (92) on that date (away team)
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd"
FROM public.t_1946_vfl_season
WHERE "date" = '13 july 1946' AND "away team score" = '14.8 (92)';

Result row:
- Home Team: Essendon | Home Team Score: 16.24 (120) | Away Team: Footscray | Away Team Score: 14.8 (92) | Venue: Windy Hill | Crowd: 29,000

Final assessment: The data show no home team scored 14.8 (92) on 13 july 1946; the score 14.8 (92) was recorded by an away team (Footscray). The claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the 1946 Victorian Football League (VFL) season captured in the table public.t_1946_vfl_season.
- The date string format used in the dataset is '13 july 1946' (lowercase month), and the verification uses that exact value.
- “home team score 14.8 (92)” is interpreted as the final score of the home team exactly matching the string '14.8 (92)'.
