Claim: “the pentium dual - core t3200 have a frequency of 2 ghz.”

Data source consulted
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table: list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors.

Evidence
1) Retrieve the clock frequency for the exact model entry
SQL executed:
SELECT frequency FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE "model number" = 'pentium dual - core t3200';
Result:
frequency = 2 GHz

Conclusion
- The database lists the model “pentium dual - core t3200” with a frequency of 2 GHz. This supports the claim exactly.

Assumptions
- “frequency” is interpreted as the base/core clock frequency as recorded in the dataset. The model naming matches the dataset’s lowercase style (“pentium dual - core t3200”).
