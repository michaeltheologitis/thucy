Summary
- Interpreted claim: The maximum points scored by the Miami Dolphins in a single game (within the available 1983 season dataset) is 38.

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (week, date, opponent, result, attendance)

Evidence
1) Extract points scored and allowed from each game’s result and list per game
SQL executed:
SELECT week, opponent, result,
    CASE 
        WHEN result LIKE 'w %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '\\d+')::integer
        WHEN result LIKE 'l %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '\\d+ -(\\d+)')::integer
    END AS points_for,
    CASE 
        WHEN result LIKE 'w %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '- (\\d+)')::integer
        WHEN result LIKE 'l %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '\\d+ -(\\d+)')::integer
    END AS points_against
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;

Result (selected):
- Week 13 vs cincinnati bengals: result = "w 38 - 14" → points_for = 38
- Other highs: Week 12 "w 37 - 0" → points_for = 37; Weeks 2 and 16 "w 34 - 24/14" → points_for = 34

2) Compute the maximum points_for across all games in 1983
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(CASE 
    WHEN result LIKE 'w %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '\\d+')::integer
    WHEN result LIKE 'l %' THEN SUBSTRING(result FROM '- (\\d+)')::integer
END) AS max_points_for
FROM public.t_1983_miami_dolphins_season;

Result: max_points_for = 38

Conclusion
- The highest points scored by the Miami Dolphins in a single game during the 1983 season is 38 points, which supports the claim within this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the Miami Dolphins and is evaluated against the available 1983 season dataset only. It does not assert a franchise all-time record across all seasons.
