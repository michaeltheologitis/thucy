Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the game/result "be 5 - 3" for Detroit Red Wings vs. Chicago Black Hawks on April 14 (implicitly in the season covered by the available data). I verified this against the available data source.

Step 1 — Discover available data sources
Result: There is one non-system table in the database: public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season.
Executed SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('pg_catalog', 'information_schema')
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

Step 2 — Understand the table structure and sample rows
Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), record (text).
Executed SQL (columns):
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season';
Executed SQL (sample rows):
SELECT * FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season LIMIT 5;
Sample shows entries for April 7, 10, 12, 14, 17 vs. Detroit, with a score string stored as "visitor - home" and a series record after each game.

Step 3 — Check the April 14 game vs Detroit
Finding: On April 14, the game details are:
- Date: April 14
- Home: Detroit Red Wings
- Visitor: Chicago Black Hawks
- Score: 1 - 5 (interpreted as visitor-home format; i.e., Chicago 1, Detroit 5)
- Series Record after game: 2 - 2
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, home, visitor, score, record 
FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season 
WHERE lower(date) = 'april 14' 
AND (home LIKE '%detroit%' OR visitor LIKE '%detroit%') 
AND (home LIKE '%chicago%' OR visitor LIKE '%chicago%');
Conclusion for April 14: The result was 5–1 in favor of Detroit (not 5–3). The series record after the game was 2–2 (not 5–3).

Step 4 — Locate the 5–3 score to check potential confusion
Finding: A 5–3 score appears on April 17 with Chicago as home and Detroit as visitor. Given the series record becomes 2–3 after that game (from Chicago’s perspective), Chicago lost that game; thus the 5 belongs to Detroit (visitor) and the 3 to Chicago (home).
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, home, visitor, score, record FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season WHERE lower(date) = 'april 17' AND (home LIKE '%detroit%' OR visitor LIKE '%detroit%') AND (home LIKE '%chicago%' OR visitor LIKE '%chicago%');

Final assessment:
- The claim that the record/score was 5–3 on April 14 for Detroit vs. Chicago is contradicted by the data. On April 14 the score was 5–1 for Detroit, and the series record became 2–2. The 5–3 score occurred on April 17, not April 14, and corresponds to a Detroit win (Chicago’s record 2–3 thereafter).

Assumptions:
- "chicago black hawk" refers to the Chicago Black Hawks (1965–66 season dataset available).
- The date "april 14" refers to the April 14 game in that dataset (1966 playoffs).
- The score column is stored as "visitor - home" and the record column reflects Chicago’s series record (wins-losses) after each game.
