Claim: “the australian open and the french open have the same result in 1996 and 1990.”

Data source inspected: TabFact database, table public.katrina_adams (rows list Grand Slam tournaments; columns list yearly results). Key columns used: tournament, 1990, 1996.

What the data shows:
- Evidence query (full table):
  SQL: SELECT * FROM public.katrina_adams;
  Relevant returned values:
  • australian open — 1990: 3r; 1996: a
  • french open — 1990: 3r; 1996: qf
- Evidence query (targeting 1996):
  SQL: SELECT tournament, "1996" FROM public.katrina_adams WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Open';
  Returned values confirm:
  • australian open — 1996: a
  • french open — 1996: qf

Assessment:
- 1996: Australian Open result = a; French Open result = qf. These are NOT the same.
- 1990: Australian Open result = 3r; French Open result = 3r. These ARE the same.

Conclusion: The claim asserts sameness in both 1996 and 1990, but only 1990 matches. Therefore, the statement contains both true and false elements.

Assumptions made:
- “Result” refers to the player’s round reached/participation status as recorded in the katrina_adams table (e.g., a = absent, 3r = third round, qf = quarterfinal).
