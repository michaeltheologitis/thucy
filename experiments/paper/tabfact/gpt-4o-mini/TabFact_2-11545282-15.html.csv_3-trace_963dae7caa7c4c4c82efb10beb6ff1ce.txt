Claim interpreted: The user seems to assert that Dan O'Sullivan played center and is associated with both Fordham (school) and the Utah Jazz (team) — effectively, that he played center for the Utah Jazz and attended/played for Fordham.

Data sources explored:
- Available authoritative source: PostgreSQL database with table public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster.
- Relevant schema (from the database):
  - Columns: player (text), nationality (text), position (text), years for jazz (text), school / club team (text).

Evidence gathered:
1) Search for players with the name containing “Sullivan” in the Utah Jazz all-time roster.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "years for jazz", "school / club team"
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE LOWER(player) LIKE LOWER('%Sullivan%');

- Result:
  - Player: Dan O 'Sullivan
  - Position: Center
  - Years for Jazz: 1990 - 91
  - School / Club Team: Fordham

Findings:
- The data explicitly lists Dan O'Sullivan on the Utah Jazz all-time roster.
- His position is Center.
- His school/club team is Fordham.
- Therefore, the data supports that Dan O'Sullivan played center, played for the Utah Jazz (1990–91), and is associated with Fordham as his school.

Conclusion:
- The core claim (interpreted as: Dan O'Sullivan played center for the Utah Jazz and is from Fordham) is supported by the database record above.

Assumptions made:
- The phrase “fordham jazz club” is interpreted as shorthand for “Fordham (college) and the Utah Jazz (team),” not a literal music club at Fordham. The database field “school / club team: Fordham” is treated as his college affiliation, and “years for jazz” refers to his tenure with the Utah Jazz.
