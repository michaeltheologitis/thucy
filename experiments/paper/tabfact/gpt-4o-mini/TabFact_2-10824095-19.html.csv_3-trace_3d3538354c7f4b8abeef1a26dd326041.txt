Summary of verification
- Interpreted claim: The user asserts that there exists a match where the home team score is 21.16 (142) and the away team is Fitzroy.
- Data source explored: public.t_1982_vfl_season (1982 VFL season data).

Schema checked
- Table: public.t_1982_vfl_season
  Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)

Evidence from data
1) Query to find all matches with home team score = '21.16 (142)'
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM public.t_1982_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '21.16 (142)';

Result:
- Home Team: Fitzroy; Home Team Score: 21.16 (142); Away Team: St Kilda; Away Team Score: 11.12 (78); Venue: Junction Oval; Crowd: 9,987; Date: 7 August 1982

2) Query to test the specific claim (home team score = '21.16 (142)' AND away team = 'Fitzroy')
SQL:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue, crowd, date
FROM public.t_1982_vfl_season
WHERE "home team score" = '21.16 (142)' AND "away team" = 'Fitzroy';

Result:
- No rows returned.

Conclusion
- The only match with a home team score of 21.16 (142) has Fitzroy as the home team and St Kilda as the away team. There is no match where the away team is Fitzroy in combination with that home score. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the phrasing to mean: “Is there a match where the home team scored 21.16 (142) and the away team was Fitzroy?”
- Scope limited to the 1982 VFL season as represented in the available dataset.
