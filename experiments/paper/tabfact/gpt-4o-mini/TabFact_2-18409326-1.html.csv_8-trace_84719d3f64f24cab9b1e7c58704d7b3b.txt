Summary
- Claim interpreted: The AM 1150 radio station owned by Astral Media has the call sign CKFR.
- Conclusion: Supported by the Kelowna media dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available source: A PostgreSQL database with a public schema containing table media_in_kelowna.

Schema (as discovered)
- Table: media_in_kelowna
  - Columns: frequency (text), call sign (text), branding (text), format (text), owner (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Overview of stations (to see if AM 1150 appears and who owns it)
SQL: SELECT frequency, "call sign", owner FROM media_in_kelowna;
Observed relevant row among results:
- frequency: 1150 am; call sign: ckfr; owner: astral media

2) Targeted lookup for AM 1150
SQL: SELECT "call sign", owner FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE frequency ILIKE '1150%';
Result:
- call sign: CKFR; owner: Astral Media

3) Uniqueness check for 1150 prefix
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE frequency LIKE '1150%';
Result: 1

4) Full record for AM 1150
SQL: SELECT * FROM media_in_kelowna WHERE frequency LIKE '1150%';
Result fields:
- Frequency: 1150 am
- Call Sign: ckfr
- Branding: am 1150

- Owner: astral media

Assessment
- The dataset explicitly lists AM 1150 with call sign CKFR and owner Astral Media. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the station represented in the provided Kelowna media dataset. Spelling/case are treated case-insensitively (e.g., ckfr vs. CKFR). Ownership reflects what is recorded in the dataset at the time of data collection.
