Claim to verify: “shane hall have an average finish of 31.39 between 1995 - 2008.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Relevant table: public.shane_hall (columns include: year, races, finish, start, wins, poles, top 5, top 10, dnf, winnings, season rank, team (s))

Step 1: Retrieve per-year stats (1995–2008)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, races, finish FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008 ORDER BY year;

Result (year – races – finish):
- 1995 – 2 – 24.0
- 1996 – 14 – 26.4
- 1997 – 28 – 27.1
- 1998 – 31 – 24.9
- 1999 – 25 – 25.8
- 2000 – 2 – 35.0
- 2001 – 33 – 27.9
- 2002 – 24 – 27.0
- 2003 – 5 – 35.8
- 2004 – 9 – 31.4
- 2005 – 7 – 40.9
- 2006 – 9 – 38.9
- 2008 – 1 – 43.0

Step 2: Compute averages over 1995–2008
A) Weighted by number of races (overall across all starts)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(races * finish) / SUM(races) AS weighted_average_finish FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
Result: 28.28 (approx.)

B) Simple unweighted mean of the yearly “finish” values
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG(finish) AS simple_average_finish FROM public.shane_hall WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;
Result: 31.39 (approx.)

Assessment
- The value 31.39 exactly matches the simple average of the season-level “finish” values from 1995–2008 (inclusive for the years present in the data).
- If “average finish” is intended to mean the driver’s overall average finishing position across all individual races in that period, the appropriate computation is the races-weighted average, which is 28.28—not 31.39.

Conclusion
- The claim is correct if interpreted as the simple average of Shane Hall’s per-season average finishes over 1995–2008.
- The claim is not correct if interpreted as the overall race-weighted average finishing position for that span.

Assumptions
- “finish” in public.shane_hall is the average finishing position for that season.
- The period “1995–2008” is inclusive and uses all years for which Shane Hall has entries in this table within that range (no entry for 2007).
