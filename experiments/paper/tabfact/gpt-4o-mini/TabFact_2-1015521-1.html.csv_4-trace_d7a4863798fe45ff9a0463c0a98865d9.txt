Data sources discovered: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with schema public and a table named uruguayan_air_force (columns: aircraft, origin, type, versions, in service).

Objective interpretation: Verify whether there are 2 in service and that the Beechcraft represents the B58 model aircraft, and clarify the operator implied by “by the us.”

Evidence gathered:
1) Search for Beechcraft/Baron entries
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" 
  FROM uruguayan_air_force 
  WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%Beechcraft%' OR aircraft ILIKE '%Baron%'
- Result:
  • Aircraft: Beechcraft Twin Bonanza | Versions: D50 | In Service: 1
  • Aircraft: Beechcraft B58 Baron   | Versions: B - 58 | In Service: 2

2) Explicit search for B58 indicators
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" 
  FROM uruguayan_air_force 
  WHERE aircraft ILIKE '%B58%' OR versions ILIKE '%B58%';
- Result:
  • Aircraft: Beechcraft B58 Baron | Versions: B - 58 | In Service: 2

Findings:
- The dataset contains an entry for “Beechcraft B58 Baron” with versions listed as “B - 58” and an “in service” count of 2. This supports the parts of the claim that refer to the Beechcraft B58 model aircraft and the count of 2 in service.
- However, the table is specifically uruguayan_air_force; there is no evidence here about the United States. The phrase “by the us” is not supported by this data source and appears inconsistent with the table’s scope (Uruguayan Air Force).

Conclusion:
- Supported: Beechcraft represents the B58 model aircraft with 2 in service (in the context of the uruguayan_air_force table).
- Not supported by available data: The operator being the United States (“by the us”).

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim within the only available data context (Uruguayan Air Force). If “us” was intended to mean the United States, the provided data source cannot verify that portion of the claim.
