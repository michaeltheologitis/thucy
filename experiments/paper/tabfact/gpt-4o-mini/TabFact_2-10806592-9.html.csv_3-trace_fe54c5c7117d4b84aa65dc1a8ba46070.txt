Summary
- Interpreted claim: For matches played on 18 June (as represented in the available dataset), no game had an attendance greater than 20,000.
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database with one table: public.t_1938_vfl_season (1938 VFL season data). Columns: home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text).

Step 1: Inspect available dates
- Purpose: Confirm how the date is represented and the scope (which dates exist).
- Evidence: Distinct date values in the table show one date: 18 June 1938.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: 18 June 1938

Step 2: Check if any game on 18 June 1938 has crowd > 20,000
- Purpose: Directly test the claim.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season WHERE date = '18 June 1938' AND crowd > 20000;
- Result: 0

Step 3: List all games and crowds to view maxima
- Purpose: See the highest attendance to ensure no game exceeds 20,000.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season ORDER BY crowd DESC LIMIT 50;
- Result (top crowds):
  - 18 June 1938 — Richmond vs Essendon at Punt Road Oval — Crowd: 20,000
  - 18 June 1938 — Footscray vs Collingwood at Western Oval — Crowd: 18,000
  - 18 June 1938 — St Kilda vs Melbourne at Junction Oval — Crowd: 14,000
  - 18 June 1938 — North Melbourne vs Carlton at Arden Street Oval — Crowd: 13,000
  - 18 June 1938 — Fitzroy vs South Melbourne at Brunswick Street Oval — Crowd: 12,000
  - 18 June 1938 — Geelong vs Hawthorn at Corio Oval — Crowd: 7,000

Step 4: Confirm absolute maximum crowd
- Purpose: Validate the overall maximum attendance in the dataset.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd, MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, COUNT(*) AS games_count FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season;
- Result: max_crowd = 20,000; min_crowd = 7,000; games_count = 6

Conclusion
- The highest recorded crowd on 18 June 1938 is exactly 20,000, and there are zero games with crowd > 20,000. Therefore, the claim that no game on the 18th of June drew a crowd of more than 20,000 is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the available dataset (1938 VFL season) where all matches are dated 18 June 1938.
- “More than 20,000” is interpreted strictly as > 20,000 (i.e., 20,000 itself does not qualify).
