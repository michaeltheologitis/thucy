Scope and data sources
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix, which contains driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, and tyre fields for the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix.
- Table schema (from database): driver (text), entrant (text), constructor (text), chassis (text), engine (text), tyre (text).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Locate entries for Bira to inspect engine and entrant
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE LOWER(driver) LIKE '%bira%';
Result:
- Driver: Prince Bira
- Entrant: Enrico Platé
- Constructor: Maserati
- Chassis: Maserati 4CLT - 48
- Engine: Maserati L4S
- Tyre: P

2) Confirm that when driver is Prince Bira and engine includes Maserati L4S, the entrant matches
SQL:
SELECT driver, engine, entrant, constructor, chassis 
FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix 
WHERE driver ILIKE 'Prince Bira%' AND engine ILIKE '%Maserati%L4S%';
Result:
- Driver: Prince Bira | Engine: Maserati L4S | Entrant: Enrico Platé | Constructor: Maserati | Chassis: Maserati 4CLT - 48

Conclusion
- In the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset, the entry with driver “Prince Bira” and engine “Maserati L4S” lists the entrant as “Enrico Platé.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted as referring to the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix entry present in the available dataset, not asserting a universal rule across all events or seasons.
