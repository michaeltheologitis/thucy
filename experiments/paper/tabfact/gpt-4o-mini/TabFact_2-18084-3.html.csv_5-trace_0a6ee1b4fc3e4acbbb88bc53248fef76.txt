Interpretation of the claim
- I interpret your statement as: “Only a few athletes from the United States have the longest mark.” Within the available data (a long_jump results table), I take “longest mark” to mean the maximum distance (in meters) recorded in the dataset.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: long_jump(mark text, wind double precision, athlete text, nationality text, venue text, date text)

Data preview (to understand formatting)
Executed SQL:
SELECT mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, date FROM public.long_jump LIMIT 20;
Observed example rows include (abridged):
- 8.95 m (29ft4¼in) | 0.3 | Mike Powell | United States | Tokyo | August 30, 1991
- 8.90 m (29ft2¼in) a | 2 | Bob Beamon | United States | Mexico City | October 18, 1968
- 8.87 m (29ft1in) | 0.2 | Carl Lewis | United States | Tokyo | August 30, 1991
…
Note: mark is text and includes both meters and feet; therefore, extracting the meter value requires parsing the initial decimal number.

Step 1: Identify the maximum mark in meters
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING(mark FROM '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+') AS DOUBLE PRECISION)) AS max_mark
FROM long_jump;
Result:
- max_mark = 8.95

Step 2: List all athletes who achieved the maximum mark and their nationalities
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT athlete, nationality
FROM long_jump
WHERE CAST(SUBSTRING(mark FROM '^[0-9]+\.[0-9]+') AS DOUBLE PRECISION) = 8.95;
Result:
- Mike Powell | United States

Findings
- The longest mark in this dataset is 8.95 meters.
- Exactly one athlete achieved this distance: Mike Powell of the United States.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that the longest mark is held by one athlete from the United States. Interpreting “few” as a small count (including one), the claim is supported by the data available.

Assumptions
- “Longest mark” refers to the maximum meter value captured in public.long_jump.
- “Few” is interpreted as a small number (including the possibility of exactly one).
