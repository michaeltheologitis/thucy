Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. Gary Payton’s high-assist total of 8 occurred on March 15 (Game 65), not on March 10. On March 10 (Game 63), the high-assists leader was Nate McMillan with 5.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify all games where Payton is listed in the high-assists field
- Result (excerpt relevant to March):
  • Game 59 – March 3: g payton (9)
  • Game 60 – March 5: g payton (12)
  • Game 62 – March 8: g payton (7)
  • Game 64 – March 11: g payton (9)
  • Game 65 – March 15: g payton (8)
  • Game 67 – March 19: g payton (11)
  • Game 70 – March 24: n mcmillan , g payton (7)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%Payton%';

2) Verify the March 10 game’s high-assists entry
- Result: Game 63 – March 10: high assists = Nate McMillan (5)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE date ILIKE '%March 10%';

3) Confirm the date(s) where Payton had exactly 8 assists as the high-assists figure
- Result: Game 65 – March 15: Gary Payton (8)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT game, date, "high assists" FROM t_1991_92_seattle_supersonics_season WHERE "high assists" ILIKE '%payton%' AND "high assists" ILIKE '%(8)%';

Assumptions:
- “g payton” refers to Gary Payton for the 1991–92 Seattle SuperSonics season (the only data source available here).
- “High assist (8)” refers to the per-game “high assists” field in the table, which lists the leading assister(s) and their assist total for that game.
- “March 10” refers to March 10, 1992 within the 1991–92 season dataset.
