Claim to verify: “Anne Street is located in Plymouth County and has no major junction for milepost or road intersect.”

Data source discovery
- We first enumerated the available tables and inspected their schema to ground the verification in the actual data available.

Executed SQL (data source overview)
1) List tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public';

2) List columns for the available table
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name='massachusetts_route_139' AND table_schema='public';

Resulting schema (public.massachusetts_route_139)
- county (text)
- location (text)
- street names (text)
- milepost (text)
- roads intersected (text)
- notes (text)

Evidence collected
1) Find any entries for “Anne Street”
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes 
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139
WHERE LOWER("street names") LIKE '%anne street%';

Result:
- County: Norfolk
- Location: Weymouth
- Street Names: Anne Street
- Milepost: (no major junctions)
- Roads Intersected: (no major junctions)
- Notes: (no major junctions)

(For completeness, a stricter equality check produced the same row.)
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes 
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 
WHERE LOWER("street names") = 'anne street';

2) Check specifically whether any “Anne Street” entry is in Plymouth County
SQL executed:
SELECT county, location, "street names", milepost, "roads intersected", notes 
FROM public.massachusetts_route_139 
WHERE LOWER("street names") LIKE '%anne street%' 
AND LOWER(county) LIKE '%plymouth%';

Result: No rows found.

Assessment against the claim
- Location/county: The data shows Anne Street associated with Route 139 is in Weymouth, Norfolk County, not Plymouth County. This contradicts the claim’s county assertion.
- Junctions (milepost/roads intersected): The row explicitly indicates “(no major junctions)” for both milepost and roads intersected, which supports the claim’s statement about lacking major junctions.

Conclusion
- The claim is a mix of true and false: the junction-related part is supported, but the county/location part is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpretation is scoped to the authoritative dataset available: public.massachusetts_route_139 (i.e., Anne Street as it pertains to Massachusetts Route 139). There may be other “Anne Street” road segments elsewhere, but verification is confined to the available data source, which is treated as authoritative per instructions.
