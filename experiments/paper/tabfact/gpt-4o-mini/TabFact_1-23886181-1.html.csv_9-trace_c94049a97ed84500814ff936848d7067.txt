Claim to verify: “team brazil, team australia, and team england be 3 of the club that participate in the 2008 season.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, football club, continent, associated football club, seasons, racing drivers). The seasons column stores participation seasons as text.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Which clubs in the table participated in 2008
- Result: The table lists clubs such as AC Milan, Beijing Guoan, FC Basel 1893, Rangers FC, and RSC Anderlecht as participating in 2008. No “Team Brazil/Australia/England” appear here.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT "football club", "seasons" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "seasons" LIKE '%2008%';

2) Direct check for “Team Brazil”, “Team Australia”, “Team England” in 2008
- Result: No rows found for these names with season 2008.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" IN ('Team Brazil', 'Team Australia', 'Team England') AND "seasons" LIKE '%2008%';

3) Do entries for these names exist at all, and if so, what seasons
- Result: Entries exist for team brazil, team australia, team england, but with Seasons: 2011 (not 2008).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "football club", seasons FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%Australia%' OR "football club" ILIKE '%England%';

4) Full list of 2008 participants (as present in the table), for context
- Result: Rows for AC Milan (2008 2009 2010), Beijing Guoan (2008 2010), FC Basel 1893 (2008 2009 2010), Rangers FC (2008 2009), RSC Anderlecht (2008 2009 2010 2011). These illustrate 2008 participants, and again do not include the three “team X” entries.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE seasons LIKE '%2008%' ORDER BY "football club";

Conclusion
- The database shows that “team brazil”, “team australia”, and “team england” exist as club entries but participated in 2011, not 2008. No evidence supports their participation in the 2008 season. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “club that participate in the 2008 season” as participation recorded in the seasons column of public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs.
- Treated “team brazil”, “team australia”, and “team england” as exact club names within this dataset, and also searched case-insensitively for partial matches (Brazil/Australia/England) to confirm seasons associated with any such entries.
