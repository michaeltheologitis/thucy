Claim to verify: "week 8 have the lowest attendance during the first 10 week, at 61603"

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data. Week 8 attendance is 61,603, but the lowest attendance in the first 10 weeks is 45,653 in week 3.

Evidence from the database (public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season):

1) Find the minimum attendance among weeks 1–10
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance 
  FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season 
  WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
- Result: 45,653

2) Identify the week(s) where this minimum occurs (within weeks 1–10)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week 
  FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season 
  WHERE attendance = 45653 AND week BETWEEN 1 AND 10;
- Result: week 3

3) List attendance for each of the first 10 weeks (weeks 1–10)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT week, attendance 
  FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season 
  WHERE week BETWEEN 1 AND 10 
  ORDER BY week ASC;
- Result:
  Week 2: 64,006
  Week 3: 45,653
  Week 4: 68,481
  Week 5: 61,535
  Week 6: 63,406
  Week 7: 54,328
  Week 8: 61,603
  Week 9: 73,118
  Week 10: 54,759

4) Confirm the week 8 attendance value
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2000_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 8;
- Result: Week 8; Date: October 22, 2000; Opponent: Denver Broncos; Result: W 31-21; Attendance: 61,603

Assessment:
- The lowest attendance in the first 10 weeks is 45,653 (week 3), not week 8.
- The stated figure for week 8 (61,603) is correct but it is not the minimum.

Assumptions made:
- "first 10 week" is interpreted as weeks 1 through 10 of the 2000 Cincinnati Bengals season contained in the table. The dataset has entries for weeks 2–10 within that range; analysis is performed over all rows where week BETWEEN 1 AND 10.
