Claim to verify: “brian sipe start 7 more game than bernie kosar.”

Summary conclusion: Supported by data. Brian Sipe is credited with 112 games started and Bernie Kosar with 105, a difference of 7 (Sipe minus Kosar).

Evidence from the data
1) Listing quarterbacks and games started (to retrieve authoritative totals for both players)
Executed SQL:
SELECT quarterback, "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks ORDER BY quarterback;

Relevant rows in the result set:
- kosar , bernie | 105
- sipe , brian   | 112

2) Directly filtering for the two players (case-insensitive match)
Executed SQL:
SELECT quarterback, "games started" FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks WHERE LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%sipe%' OR LOWER(quarterback) LIKE '%kosar%';

Result excerpt:
- sipe , brian | 112
- kosar , bernie | 105

Computation
- Difference = 112 (Sipe) − 105 (Kosar) = 7

Conclusion
- The claim that Brian Sipe started 7 more games than Bernie Kosar is supported by the data in the available table of Cleveland Browns starting quarterbacks.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “start” as games started for the Cleveland Browns specifically, as captured in the table list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks. No inference is made about total NFL career starts with other teams.
