Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and its scope, then inspected the schema to understand how to compute combined runs from the score text. Finally, queried September games to compare combined runs on September 1 against the minimum in that month.

Data source discovery
- Available dataset: a PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season covering the Toronto Blue Jays’ 1997 season.

Schema inspection
- Table t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).
- The score column stores the final score in a string format like "3 - 0"; combined runs must be computed by parsing the two numbers and summing them.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Combined runs on September 1
- Result: 3
- Executed SQL:
SELECT (CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER)) AS combined_runs 
FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE date = 'september 1';

2) Minimum combined runs in September (and which date achieved it)
- Result: Minimum combined runs = 2, occurring on september 9 with score 2 - 0
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, score, (CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '^[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTRING(score FROM '[0-9]+$') AS INTEGER)) AS combined_runs 
FROM t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season 
WHERE date LIKE 'september%' 
ORDER BY combined_runs 
LIMIT 1;

Conclusion
- September 1 had 3 combined runs, but at least one September game (September 9) had only 2 combined runs. Therefore, the combined runs on September 1 were not the lowest of any game that month.

Assumptions
- "Combined run" is interpreted as the sum of both teams’ final scores in a game.
- "That month" refers to September in the 1997 Toronto Blue Jays season, as per the available dataset.
