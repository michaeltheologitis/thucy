Claim to verify: "shane hall have more top 10 placement than top 5 placement"

Data source discovery:
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.shane_hall.

Schema details used:
- Table: public.shane_hall
  Columns (relevant): "top 10" (bigint), "top 5" (bigint)

Method:
- Sum the counts of "top 10" and "top 5" finishes across all years in the shane_hall table and compare the totals.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Total top 10 finishes
SQL:
SELECT SUM("top 10") AS total_top_10 FROM shane_hall;
Result: total_top_10 = 6

2) Total top 5 finishes
SQL:
SELECT SUM("top 5") AS total_top_5 FROM shane_hall;
Result: total_top_5 = 1

Analysis:
- 6 (top 10) > 1 (top 5). The data shows Shane Hall has more top-10 finishes than top-5 finishes.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Placement" refers to counts of finishes as recorded in the columns "top 10" and "top 5".
- Totals are computed across all years recorded in the table.
