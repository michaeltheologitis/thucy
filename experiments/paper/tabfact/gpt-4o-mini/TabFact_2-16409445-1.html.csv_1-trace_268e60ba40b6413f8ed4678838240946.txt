Claim to verify: Week 4 has a higher attendance than Week 3.

Data discovery and context:
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season capturing the 1997 Oakland Raiders season.
- Relevant schema (public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season):
  - week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), tv time (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Retrieve attendance for weeks 3 and 4
SQL:
SELECT week, attendance FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week IN (3, 4);
Result:
- Week 3: 47922
- Week 4: 72586

2) Compute week 3 attendance, week 4 attendance, boolean comparison, and difference in a single query
SQL:
SELECT 
    MAX(CASE WHEN week = 3 THEN attendance END) AS week_3_attendance, 
    MAX(CASE WHEN week = 4 THEN attendance END) AS week_4_attendance, 
    MAX(CASE WHEN week = 4 THEN attendance END) > MAX(CASE WHEN week = 3 THEN attendance END) AS week_4_greater_than_week_3, 
    (MAX(CASE WHEN week = 4 THEN attendance END) - MAX(CASE WHEN week = 3 THEN attendance END)) AS attendance_difference 
FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season 
WHERE week IN (3, 4);
Result:
- week_3_attendance: 47922
- week_4_attendance: 72586
- week_4_greater_than_week_3: true
- attendance_difference: 24664

Conclusion:
- Week 4 attendance (72,586) is higher than Week 3 attendance (47,922) by 24,664. The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “Attendance” refers to the attendance column in public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season.
- “Week 3” and “Week 4” correspond to rows where week = 3 and week = 4 in the 1997 Oakland Raiders dataset.
