Claim to verify: “west germany have 2 of the top 6 and win a gold medal.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Available table: public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  - Columns: rank (bigint), name (text), nation (text), sp + fs (bigint), points (double precision), places (double precision)

Evidence 1: Who are the top 6 and which nations do they represent?
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation 
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
ORDER BY rank 
LIMIT 6;
Result (rank, name, nation):
1, Mark Cockerell, United States
2, Takashi Mura, Japan
3, Brian Pockar, Canada
4, Norbert Schramm, West Germany
5, Andrew Bestwick, United Kingdom
6, Stephan Bril, West Germany
Finding: West Germany appears twice within the top 6 (ranks 4 and 6), confirming the first part of the claim.

Evidence 2: Did West Germany win the gold medal in this event?
Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, name, nation 
FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
WHERE rank = 1;
Result: 1, Mark Cockerell, United States
Finding: The gold medalist is from the United States, not West Germany. This contradicts the second part of the claim.

Conclusion
- “west germany have 2 of the top 6”: Supported by the data (ranks 4 and 6).
- “and win a gold medal”: Contradicted by the data (gold went to the United States).

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the event represented by the available table (1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships results in this dataset). No other disciplines or events are present in the accessible data, so verification is limited to this event’s results.
