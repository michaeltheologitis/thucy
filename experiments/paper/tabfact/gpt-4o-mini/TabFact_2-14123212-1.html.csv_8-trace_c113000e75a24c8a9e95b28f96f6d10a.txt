Claim: “w293al and w264bf share the same erp w.”

Step 1: Explore available data sources
- Verified available tables and columns.
  - Executed SQL: SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
    - Result: whlp
  - Executed SQL: SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
    - Result: Table whlp with columns: "frequency mhz", "erp w", "call sign", "city of license", "class", "fcc info"

Step 2: Retrieve ERP W for the two call signs
- Executed SQL: SELECT "call sign", "erp w" FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ILIKE 'W293AL' OR "call sign" ILIKE 'W264BF';
  - Result rows:
    - w264bf | 2
    - w293al | 80

Step 3: Check for multiple rows or differing values per call sign (sanity check)
- Executed SQL: SELECT "call sign", "erp w", COUNT(*) AS matching_rows FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ILIKE 'W293AL' GROUP BY "call sign", "erp w";
  - Result: W293AL | 80 | matching_rows = 1
- Executed SQL: SELECT "call sign", "erp w", COUNT(*) AS matching_rows FROM public.whlp WHERE "call sign" ILIKE 'W264BF' GROUP BY "call sign", "erp w";
  - Result: W264BF | 2 | matching_rows = 1

Findings
- W293AL has ERP W = 80.
- W264BF has ERP W = 2.
- They do not share the same ERP W value.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “w293al” and “w264bf” as call signs stored in column "call sign" of table public.whlp.
- Interpreted “erp w” as the Effective Radiated Power (in watts) stored in column "erp w".
- Equality assessed case-insensitively for call signs (ILIKE).
