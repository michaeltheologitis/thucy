Claim to verify: “Lleyton Hewitt faced the same opponent, Wayne Ferreira, in every Masters Series final.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Table: public.lleyton_hewitt(outcome text, year bigint, championship text, surface text, opponent text, score text)

What the data shows
1) All recorded Masters Series finals for Lleyton Hewitt (year, event, opponent, outcome)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, championship, opponent, outcome, score 
FROM lleyton_hewitt 
ORDER BY year ASC, championship ASC;

Result snapshot:
- 2000 | stuttgart         | wayne ferreira   | runner - up | 6-7(6-8), 6-3, 7-6(7-5), 6-7(2-7), 2-6
- 2002 | cincinnati        | carlos moyá      | runner - up | 5-7, 6-7(5-7)
- 2002 | indian wells      | tim henman       | winner      | 6-1, 6-2
- 2002 | paris             | marat safin      | runner - up | 6-7(4-7), 0-6, 4-6
- 2003 | indian wells (2)  | gustavo kuerten  | winner      | 6-1, 6-1
- 2004 | cincinnati (2)    | andre agassi     | runner - up | 3-6, 6-3, 2-6
- 2005 | indian wells      | roger federer    | runner - up | 2-6, 4-6, 4-6

Interpretation: These championships (Stuttgart [Masters at the time], Cincinnati, Indian Wells, Paris) are ATP Masters Series events in the listed years. The outcomes indicate finals (winner/runner-up), and the opponent field shows the specific finalist faced.

2) Total number of finals, finals vs. Wayne Ferreira, and distinct opponents
- Total rows (finals) count
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: 7

- Finals against Wayne Ferreira (case-insensitive)
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS ferreira_count 
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt 
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'wayne ferreira';
Result: 1

- Distinct opponents and their counts
SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS opponent_count 
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt 
GROUP BY opponent;
Result: one each of: Marat Safin, Andre Agassi, Carlos Moyá, Gustavo Kuerten, Tim Henman, Roger Federer, Wayne Ferreira (7 distinct opponents total)

- Count of distinct opponents and list
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT opponent) AS distinct_opponent_count, 
       ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT opponent ORDER BY opponent) AS opponents_list
FROM public.lleyton_hewitt;
Result: 7 distinct opponents: Andre Agassi, Carlos Moyá, Gustavo Kuerten, Marat Safin, Roger Federer, Tim Henman, Wayne Ferreira

Conclusion
- Hewitt did face Wayne Ferreira in one Masters Series final (Stuttgart 2000), but not “in every Masters Series final.” He faced seven different opponents across seven Masters Series finals. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The lleyton_hewitt table enumerates Lleyton Hewitt’s ATP Masters Series finals, as indicated by the championship names (Stuttgart [Masters in 2000], Cincinnati, Indian Wells, Paris) and the outcome field reflecting final results (winner/runner-up).
