Data sources explored
- Discovered a single authoritative database: uruguayan_air_force (public schema) with one table: uruguayan_air_force having columns: aircraft (text), origin (text), type (text), versions (text), in service (text).

Evidence collected
1) Inventory overview
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.uruguayan_air_force;
Key relevant rows observed:
- aermacchi sf260 | origin: italy | versions: t - 260 eu | in service: 12
- pilatus pc - 7 turbo trainer | origin: switzerland | versions: - 92 | in service: 5 (6 delivered)

2) Direct check for T-260 EU
SQL executed:
SELECT aircraft, origin, "in service" FROM uruguayan_air_force WHERE versions = 't - 260 eu';
Result:
- aircraft: aermacchi sf260 | origin: italy | in service: 12

3) All Swiss-origin aircraft in this dataset
SQL executed:
SELECT aircraft, versions, "in service" FROM public.uruguayan_air_force WHERE origin = 'switzerland';
Result:
- aircraft: pilatus pc - 7 turbo trainer | versions: - 92 | in service: 5 (6 delivered)

Assessment of the claim
- The dataset shows 12 units in service for the variant labeled t - 260 eu, but they are associated with the aermacchi sf260 whose origin is italy, not switzerland.
- The only Swiss-origin aircraft listed is the pilatus pc - 7 turbo trainer, with 5 in service, not 12.

Conclusion
- The claim that there are 12 T-260 EU aircraft currently in service that originate from Switzerland is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available authoritative dataset (Uruguayan Air Force inventory). If a different fleet or global registry was intended, that data is not present in the connected sources.
