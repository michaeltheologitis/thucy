Summary
Claim: The crowd at the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game was smaller than the crowd at the Essendon vs Richmond game.
Verdict basis: Using the 1972 VFL season dataset (table t_1972_vfl_season), I located the specific matches involving these team pairs and compared their recorded crowds.

Evidence
1) Identify exact team name spellings in the dataset (to ensure correct matching)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "home team" AS team_name FROM t_1972_vfl_season
UNION
SELECT DISTINCT "away team" AS team_name FROM t_1972_vfl_season
ORDER BY team_name;
Result excerpt (relevant entries):
- fitzroy
- north melbourne
- essendon
- richmond

2) Fitzroy vs North Melbourne crowd
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd 
FROM t_1972_vfl_season 
WHERE lower("home team") IN ('fitzroy', 'north melbourne') 
AND lower("away team") IN ('fitzroy', 'north melbourne') 
ORDER BY date;
Result:
- Date: 15 July 1972 | Home Team: Fitzroy | Away Team: North Melbourne | Venue: Junction Oval | Crowd: 7007

3) Essendon vs Richmond crowd
SQL executed:
SELECT date, "home team", "away team", venue, crowd
FROM t_1972_vfl_season
WHERE lower("home team") IN ('essendon', 'richmond') 
AND lower("away team") IN ('essendon', 'richmond');
Result:
- Date: 15 July 1972 | Home Team: Essendon | Away Team: Richmond | Venue: Windy Hill | Crowd: 22,251

Comparison
- Fitzroy vs North Melbourne crowd: 7,007
- Essendon vs Richmond crowd: 22,251
Conclusion: 7,007 < 22,251, so the Fitzroy vs North Melbourne game had a smaller crowd than the Essendon vs Richmond game (on 15 July 1972).

Assumptions
- The claim is interpreted within the scope of the available dataset (t_1972_vfl_season). The matches found for both pairs in this dataset occurred on 15 July 1972, and these are the games compared. The database is treated as authoritative for this verification.
