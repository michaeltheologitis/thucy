Claim interpreted: The user asserts that the US Open had different results in 1990 and 1999 (as recorded in the available dataset). Given the single available table is named katrina_adams, we interpret this as referring to Katrina Adams’ US Open results in those years.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: katrina_adams.

Relevant schema (from discovery):
- Table katrina_adams with columns: tournament (text), and year columns (text): 1986, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1991, 1992, 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996, 1997, 1998, 1999.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Identify tournament naming to locate the correct row
- SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT tournament FROM katrina_adams;
- Result excerpt (relevant values): US Open, Wimbledon, French Open, Grand Slam Tournaments, Australian Open

2) Retrieve US Open results for 1990 and 1999
- SQL:
SELECT tournament, "1990", "1999" FROM katrina_adams WHERE tournament ILIKE '%US Open%';
- Result:
  - tournament: us open
  - 1990: 3r
  - 1999: 1r

Assessment:
- The results for 1990 (3r, Third Round) and 1999 (1r, First Round) differ. Therefore, the claim that the US Open had different results in 1990 and 1999 is supported by the data in the katrina_adams table.

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the available data.

Assumptions:
- The katrina_adams table records Katrina Adams’ tournament results by year.
- The user’s reference to “the us open” pertains to this context (Katrina Adams’ performance), given the available dataset.
- Round abbreviations: 1r = First Round; 3r = Third Round.
