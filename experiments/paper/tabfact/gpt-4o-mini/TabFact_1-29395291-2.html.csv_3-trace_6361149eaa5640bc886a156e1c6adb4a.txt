Summary
- Claim: "glo mobile of nigeria have 11000 subscriber in 2006"
- What the data shows: The dataset records subscriber counts in thousands. For Glo Mobile (Nigeria) in 2006, the value is 11,000 (thousands) = 11,000,000 subscribers.
- Assessment: The numeric value 11,000 matches the dataset only if interpreted as thousands. As written (“11000 subscriber”), the claim omits the unit and implies 11,000 subscribers, which is off by a factor of 1,000.

Data sources explored
- Identified a PostgreSQL database with a schema containing a table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa

Schema details
- Table: public.mobile_telephony_in_africa
  - provider (text)
  - country (text)
  - subscribers (2005) (thousands) (bigint)
  - subscribers (2006) (thousands) (bigint)
  - growth % (double precision)
  - Note: Subscriber columns are explicitly labeled “(thousands)”.

Evidence (executed SQL and results)
1) Locate Nigeria rows and any provider containing “glo”
SQL:
SELECT provider, country, "subscribers (2006) (thousands)" 
FROM public.mobile_telephony_in_africa 
WHERE provider ILIKE '%glo%' OR country ILIKE '%nig%';

Result rows (relevant excerpt):
- Provider: Glo Mobile | Country: Nigeria | 2006 Subscribers: 11,000 (thousands)

Findings
- Glo Mobile (Nigeria) had 11,000 (thousands) subscribers in 2006, i.e., 11,000,000 subscribers.

Conclusion
- The claim is numerically aligned only if the unit “thousands” is implied. As stated (“11000 subscriber”), it is missing the unit and therefore materially understates the actual subscriber total by 1,000x.

Assumptions
- “Glo Mobile” refers to Globacom’s mobile service in Nigeria.
- The dataset’s subscriber figures are authoritative and measured in thousands, per the column label.
