Claim to verify: “all games in the 2006 season were played in the month of September.”

Data sources discovered
- Database contains schema public with table: public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Step 1: Inspect sample game dates to understand format
Result: Dates are stored as text like “september 1”.
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season LIMIT 10;

Step 2: Identify which months appear in the dataset
Result: Distinct months present are “september” and “october”.
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT LOWER(SUBSTRING(date FROM '^[^ ]+')) AS month_name
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season;

Step 3: Count games per month
Result: September: 26 games; October: 1 game.
Executed SQL:
SELECT LOWER(split_part(date, ' ', 1)) AS month_name, COUNT(*) AS game_count
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
GROUP BY month_name
ORDER BY MIN(date);

Step 4: Show the October game(s) as direct counterexample(s)
Result: At least one game in October.
- Date: October 1; Opponent: Mariners; Score: 3 - 2; Record: 80 - 82
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score, record 
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE date ILIKE 'october%';

Conclusion
The dataset shows games in both September and October of 2006. Therefore, it is false that all games in the 2006 season were played only in September.

Assumptions
- The claim was interpreted with respect to the available dataset for the 2006 Texas Rangers season (table public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season), as this is the authoritative data source accessible here.
