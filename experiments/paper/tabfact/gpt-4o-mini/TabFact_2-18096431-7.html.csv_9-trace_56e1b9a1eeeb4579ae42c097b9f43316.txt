Summary conclusion: The claim is false. In the 1996 PGA Championship dataset, Mark Brooks earned $170,000 more than Kenny Perry (not the other way around).

Data source overview:
- Database: sports golf database
- Table: public.t_1996_pga_championship(place text, player text, country text, score text, "to par" text, money bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Top earners listing (shows both players and their prize money)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, place, money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship ORDER BY money DESC LIMIT 10;
- Relevant returned rows:
  - Mark Brooks — Place: 1st — Money: 430000
  - Kenny Perry — Place: 2nd — Money: 260000

2) Kenny Perry’s prize money
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player = 'Kenny Perry';
- Returned: 260000

3) Mark Brooks’ prize money
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT money FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player = 'Mark Brooks';
- Returned: 430000

Calculation:
- Difference (Kenny Perry − Mark Brooks) = 260000 − 430000 = −170000
- Therefore, Kenny Perry did not earn $170,000 more; he earned $170,000 less than Mark Brooks in this dataset.

Assumptions made:
- “earn” refers to prize money awarded in the 1996 PGA Championship (as represented in the available dataset).
- “mark brook” is intended to refer to golfer Mark Brooks.
- The verification is constrained to the authoritative dataset available (1996 PGA Championship table).
