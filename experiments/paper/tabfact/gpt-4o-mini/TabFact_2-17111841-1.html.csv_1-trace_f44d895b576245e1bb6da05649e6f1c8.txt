Claim to verify: The least watched episode number with an original airdate of 8 June 2008 is 4.

Data discovery and schema
- Available source: PostgreSQL database "TabFact" with table public.my_info_table.
- Relevant columns: episode (bigint), original airdate (text), viewers (millions) (double precision), plus timeslot (approx), nightly rank.

Evidence
1) Confirm that the date exists in the data
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "original airdate" 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE "original airdate" LIKE '%2008%' 
ORDER BY "original airdate" ASC;
Result excerpt includes: 8 june 2008 (among other 2008 dates), confirming the date is present.

2) Retrieve episodes on 8 june 2008 and determine least viewership
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, "viewers (millions)" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE "original airdate" = '8 june 2008' ORDER BY "viewers (millions)" ASC;
Result:
- Episode: 4; Viewers (millions): 1.364

Analysis
- Only one row matches original airdate = '8 june 2008'. Therefore, episode 4 is trivially the least watched for that date, with 1.364 million viewers.

Conclusion
- The data supports the claim: the least watched episode number on 8 June 2008 is 4.

Assumptions
- "Least watched" is interpreted as the minimum value of the column "viewers (millions)".
- "Episode number" corresponds to the column episode.
- The date is matched exactly as stored text ('8 june 2008').
