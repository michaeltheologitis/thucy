Summary conclusion: The available data shows only one character—kazan (male)—is alive after exiting the cube. No female character is recorded as leaving the cube alive. Therefore, the claim that both a male and a female leave the cube alive is not supported by the data.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.cube_film_series.
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - Columns: name (text), occupation (text), gender (text), prison connection (text), played by (text), status (text).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct statuses and counts
SQL:
SELECT status, COUNT(*) AS character_count
FROM cube_film_series
GROUP BY status;
Result:
- status = "alive after exiting the cube"; character_count = 1
- status = "dead"; character_count = 5

2) Who is alive after exiting the cube
SQL:
SELECT name, gender, status FROM cube_film_series WHERE status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result:
- name = kazan; gender = male; status = alive after exiting the cube

3) Any female alive after exiting the cube
SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS female_alive_count
FROM cube_film_series
WHERE gender = 'female'
AND status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result: 0
SQL (names):
SELECT name 
FROM cube_film_series
WHERE gender = 'female' 
AND status = 'alive after exiting the cube';
Result: none

4) Full roster for transparency
SQL:
SELECT name, gender, status FROM cube_film_series;
Result:
- kazan | male | alive after exiting the cube
- david worth | male | dead
- quentin | male | dead
- joan leaven | female | dead
- dr helen holloway | female | dead
- rennes | male | dead

Conclusion
- The dataset indicates exactly one survivor exiting the cube alive (kazan, male) and zero female survivors exiting alive. Thus, the claim that both a male and a female leave the cube alive is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the scenario represented by the available dataset (which reflects the principal characters of the Cube film represented in this table).
