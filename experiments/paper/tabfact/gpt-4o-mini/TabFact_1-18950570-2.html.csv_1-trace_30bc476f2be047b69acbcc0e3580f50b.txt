Claim to verify: “in the period 1995 - 2000, the imr be 34.0 and the life expectancy be 69.3.”

Data source exploration
- Available database contains one table: public.my_info_table.
- Relevant columns: period (text), imr (bigint), life expectancy total (double precision), among others.

Schema evidence (from schema inspection)
- Table: my_info_table
  - period (text)
  - imr (bigint)
  - life expectancy total (double precision)
  - life expectancy males (double precision)
  - life expectancy females (double precision)
  - other demographic metrics

Step 1: Confirm the period exists
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT period FROM public.my_info_table ORDER BY period ASC;
Result excerpt (relevant portion):
- ...
- 1990 - 1995
- 1995 - 2000
- 2000 - 2005

Step 2: Retrieve IMR and life expectancy for the target period
Executed SQL:
SELECT imr, "life expectancy total" FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '1995 - 2000';
Result:
- imr = 34
- life expectancy total = 69.3

Assessment
- The claim states IMR = 34.0 and life expectancy = 69.3 for 1995 - 2000.
- The data shows IMR = 34 (integer) and life expectancy total = 69.3.
- The IMR difference (34 vs 34.0) is a formatting/precision difference only; the values match.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the data in public.my_info_table for the period 1995 - 2000.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the single entity represented in public.my_info_table (the table appears to be a single time series without a country/entity column).
