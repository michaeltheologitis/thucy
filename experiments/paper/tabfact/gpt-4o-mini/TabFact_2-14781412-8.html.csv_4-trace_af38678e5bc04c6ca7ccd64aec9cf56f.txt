Scope and approach
- Objective: Verify whether South Korea is the only country to have hosted equestrian at the Asian Games more than once, and assess the supporting examples (Seoul, Doha, and possibly Incheon).
- Data source: A single table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games that lists years and locations (cities) for editions of the Asian Games that included equestrian competitions.
- Method: Inspect the available records, enumerate host locations by year, and check for repeated hosts. Then interpret which countries those cities belong to.

Evidence from the database
1) List of years and locations
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;

Result (ordered by year):
- 1982 — New Delhi
- 1986 — Seoul
- 1994 — Hiroshima
- 1998 — Bangkok
- 2002 — Busan
- 2006 — Doha
- 2010 — Guangzhou

2) Frequency of each location in the table
Executed SQL:
SELECT location, COUNT(*) as count
FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY count DESC, location;

Result:
- Bangkok — 1
- Busan — 1
- Doha — 1
- Guangzhou — 1
- Hiroshima — 1
- New Delhi — 1
- Seoul — 1

Analysis
- The data shows the equestrian-hosting Asian Games editions (in the dataset’s range) occurred in the following cities: New Delhi, Seoul, Hiroshima, Bangkok, Busan, Doha, and Guangzhou. Each city appears once in the table.
- Considering widely known geography: Seoul and Busan are cities in South Korea; Doha is in Qatar. Therefore, within this dataset (1982–2010), there are two South Korean host cities (Seoul in 1986 and Busan in 2002), indicating South Korea hosted equestrian more than once during the covered years. The other listed cities are in India (New Delhi), Japan (Hiroshima), Thailand (Bangkok), Qatar (Doha), and China (Guangzhou) and each of those countries appears once via one city.
- The claim’s supporting detail “in Seoul and Doha” is incorrect: Doha is not in South Korea and appears as a separate, non–South Korean host location in 2006.
- The claim also mentions Incheon, but the table stops at 2010 and does not include a 2014 Incheon entry. Therefore, we cannot confirm Incheon within the available data.

Conclusion
- Based on the available data (1982–2010), South Korea is indeed the only country appearing to have hosted equestrian more than once (via two distinct South Korean cities: Seoul and Busan). However, the examples provided in the claim are materially wrong in attributing Doha as a South Korean host, and Incheon is not present in the dataset.

Assumptions and limitations
- City-to-country mapping (e.g., Seoul and Busan -> South Korea; Doha -> Qatar) is based on standard geographic knowledge; the table itself lists only city names.
- The dataset covers editions from 1982 through 2010. It does not include potential later editions (e.g., Incheon 2014), so any statement about those years cannot be verified here.
