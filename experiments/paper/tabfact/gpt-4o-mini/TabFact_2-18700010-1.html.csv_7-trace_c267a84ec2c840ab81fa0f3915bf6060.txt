Claim to verify: "Tommy Smith has the highest number of league goals."

Data scope considered
- The accessible data source is a PostgreSQL database with a single table: t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season (Huddersfield Town F.C., 1979–80 season). Columns include name, position, league apps, league goals, cup stats, and totals.

Evidence
1) Identify the top league goal scorer(s)
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season ORDER BY "league goals" DESC LIMIT 1;
Result (from tool): Ian Robins — 25 league goals

Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX("league goals") AS max_goals FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season;
Result (from tool): max_goals = 25

Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE "league goals" = 25 ORDER BY name;
Result (from tool): Ian Robins — 25 league goals (no ties reported)

2) Check Tommy Smith’s league goals
Executed SQL:
SELECT name, "league goals" FROM t_1979_80_huddersfield_town_f_c_season WHERE name ILIKE 'Tommy Smith' OR (name ILIKE '%Tommy%' AND name ILIKE '%Smith%');
Result (from tool): Tommy Smith — 0 league goals

Conclusion
- Within the 1979–80 Huddersfield Town F.C. season dataset, Tommy Smith does not have the highest number of league goals. The top scorer is Ian Robins with 25 league goals; Tommy Smith has 0 league goals. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Because the only available dataset pertains to Huddersfield Town F.C.’s 1979–80 season, the claim was interpreted in that context. If the claim intended a different league, team, or season, that is outside the available data and could not be verified here.
