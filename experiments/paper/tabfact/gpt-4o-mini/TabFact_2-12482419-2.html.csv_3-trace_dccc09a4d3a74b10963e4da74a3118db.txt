Claim interpreted: The user asserts that “in 2011, 0.535 be the average win percentage of a season with a GB of 5.” I verify this against the available seasons data for the Nashville Sounds (only accessible data source).

Data source and relevant fields:
- Table: public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
- Relevant columns: year (text), record (text), "win %" (stored per-thousand, bigint), gb (text)

Evidence 1 — 2011 season details:
SQL executed:
SELECT year, record, "win %", gb 
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons 
WHERE year = '2011';
Result:
- Year: 2011
- Record: 71 - 73
- Win %: 49.3% (i.e., 0.493)
- GB: 9
Interpretation: In 2011, the team was 9 games back with a win percentage of ~0.493, not GB=5 nor 0.535.

Evidence 2 — Which seasons have GB = 5:
SQL executed:
SELECT gb, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
GROUP BY gb
ORDER BY row_count DESC;
Key observation: There is exactly one season with gb = '5'.

Evidence 3 — The season(s) with GB = 5 and its win percentage:
SQL executed:
SELECT year, record, "win %", gb 
FROM public.list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons 
WHERE gb = '5';
Result:
- Year: 2010
- Record: 77 - 67
- Win %: 53.5% (i.e., 0.535)
- GB: 5
Interpretation: The only season with GB=5 is 2010, and its win percentage is 0.535.

Evidence 4 — Average win percentage for GB = 5 (converted to fraction):
Note: "win %" is stored per-thousand (e.g., 535 = 53.5%).
SQL executed:
SELECT AVG("win %"::float / 1000) AS average_win_percentage
FROM list_of_nashville_sounds_seasons
WHERE gb = '5';
Result:
- average_win_percentage = 0.535
Interpretation: The average win percentage among seasons with GB=5 is 0.535, but this pertains to 2010 (the only such season), not 2011.

Findings:
- In 2011, the Nashville Sounds had GB=9 and win%=0.493.
- The average win percentage for seasons with GB=5 is indeed 0.535, but that applies to 2010, not 2011.

Conclusion: The claim attaches the correct average win percentage for GB=5 (0.535) to the wrong year. Therefore, the statement as written is not supported by the data for 2011.

Assumptions made:
- GB is interpreted as “games behind” per the dataset’s gb column.
- Scope is limited to the available Nashville Sounds seasons dataset (the only accessible authoritative source).
- “Average win percentage of a season with a GB of 5” is computed over all seasons where gb='5'. Since only one season matches, the average equals that season’s win percentage (0.535).
