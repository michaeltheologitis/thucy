Claim to verify: “West Berkshire Brewery’s Maggs Magnificent Mild won a gold medal every single time it won a prize between 1995 and 2009.”

Data sources explored
- Database: west_berkshire_brewery (public schema)
- Table: public.west_berkshire_brewery
  - Columns: year (bigint), beer name (text), prize (text), category (text), competition (text)

Evidence
Query A: Retrieve all prize-winning records for Maggs Magnificent Mild between 1995 and 2009 (inclusive), with year, competition, category, and prize.
Executed SQL:
SELECT year, competition, category, prize 
FROM public.west_berkshire_brewery 
WHERE "beer name" = 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' 
AND year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2009;

Returned rows:
- 1995 | CAMRA West Berkshire | Mild Ales | gold medal
- 1996 | CAMRA West Berkshire | Mild Ales | gold medal
- 1997 | British Beer Challenge | Mild Ales | silver medal
- 1998 | CAMRA West Berkshire | Mild Ales | overall winner
- 1999 | British Beer Challenge | Mild Ales | bronze medal
- 2001 | Great British Beer Festival | Mild Ales | silver medal
- 2004 | Great British Beer Festival | Mild Ales | gold medal
- 2005 | CAMRA West Berkshire | Mild Ales | silver medal

Assessment
- Within 1995–2009, Maggs Magnificent Mild’s recorded prizes include silver medals (1997, 2001, 2005), a bronze medal (1999), and an “overall winner” (1998), in addition to gold medals (1995, 1996, 2004).
- Therefore, it did not win a gold medal every time it won a prize during this period.

Conclusion
The claim is contradicted by the data: there are multiple prize instances that are not gold medals in the 1995–2009 range.

Assumptions
- “Prize” refers to any entry in the prize column (e.g., gold/silver/bronze medal, overall winner) for the specified beer.
- Timeframe is inclusive of 1995 and 2009.
- Beer name matched exactly as 'Maggs Magnificent Mild' in the database.
