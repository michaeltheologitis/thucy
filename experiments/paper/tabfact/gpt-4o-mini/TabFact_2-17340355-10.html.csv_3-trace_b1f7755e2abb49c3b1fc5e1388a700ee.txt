Claim to verify: “the game against minnesota have a higher attendance than the game against new orleans.”

Data source discovery and schema grounding:
- Available dataset: NBA 2008–09 season (Phoenix Suns). Table: t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season.
- Relevant columns:
  - date (text)
  - team (text) — indicates the opponent (e.g., minnesota, new orleans)
  - location attendance (text) — venue name followed by numeric attendance (e.g., “target center 18478”)

Evidence gathered:
1) Retrieved games vs Minnesota and New Orleans with parsed attendance, plus a grouped max summary.

Executed SQL (detail rows):
SELECT date, team, "location attendance", CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM ' \d+$') AS INTEGER) AS attendance
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team IN ('minnesota', 'new orleans')

Result (key fields):
- New Orleans — Date: April 8; Location Attendance: New Orleans Arena 17781; Parsed Attendance: 17781
- Minnesota — Date: April 11; Location Attendance: Target Center 18478; Parsed Attendance: 18478

Executed SQL (summary):
SELECT team, MAX(CAST(SUBSTRING("location attendance" FROM ' \d+$') AS INTEGER)) AS max_attendance
FROM t_2008_09_phoenix_suns_season
WHERE team IN ('minnesota', 'new orleans')
GROUP BY team

Result (max attendance by opponent):
- Minnesota: 18478
- New Orleans: 17781

Assessment:
- The observed attendance for the Minnesota game (18,478) is higher than for the New Orleans game (17,781).

Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data in the referenced table.

Assumptions:
- “Team” denotes the opponent.
- The claim refers to the specific games found in the table (which lists one game each vs Minnesota and New Orleans with attendance as shown).
