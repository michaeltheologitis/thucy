What was checked:
- Claim: “a 2000 steam buggy theme coin by artist john mordon be price at 59.95.” Interpreted as: There exists a year-2000 Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coin with theme “Steam Buggy,” designed by artist John Mordon, issued at a price of $59.95.

Evidence from the data source (Royal Canadian Mint numismatic coins in the 2000s):
1) Search for a 2000 coin with theme containing “steam buggy”
- Result: One matching row was found with year 2000, theme “steam buggy,” artist “john mardon,” issue price 59.95.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, mintage, "issue price" 
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s 
WHERE year = 2000 AND LOWER(theme) LIKE '%steam buggy%';

Returned row (as reported by the query tool):
- Year: 2000
- Theme: steam buggy
- Artist: john mardon
- Mintage: 44367
- Issue Price: 59.95

2) Check if any coin lists the artist as “john mordon”
- Result: No rows with artist spelled “john mordon.”
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, theme, artist, "issue price" 
FROM public.royal_canadian_mint_numismatic_coins_2000s 
WHERE LOWER(artist) = LOWER('john mordon');

Conclusion:
- True: A 2000 “Steam Buggy” themed coin exists and its issue price is 59.95.
- Inaccuracy: The artist’s surname in the claim is misspelled. The data shows the artist is John Mardon (not “Mordon”).

Assumptions:
- “be price at 59.95” is interpreted as the coin’s original issue price.
- “theme coin” refers to a Royal Canadian Mint numismatic issue, consistent with the available dataset.
