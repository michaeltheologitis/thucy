Claim interpreted: “George Town is the NTFA Division 1 team that has 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws.”

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: my_info_table
  - Columns: "ntfa div 1" (team name, text), wins (bigint), byes (bigint), losses (bigint), draws (bigint), against (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Full standings snapshot (teams with wins and draws)
SQL:
SELECT "ntfa div 1" AS team_name, wins, draws FROM my_info_table;
Result excerpt:
- Bridgenorth — wins: 15, draws: 0
- Rocherlea — wins: 13, draws: 0
- Bracknell — wins: 12, draws: 1
- George Town — wins: 9, draws: 1
- Scottsdale — wins: 8, draws: 0
- Deloraine — wins: 6, draws: 2
- Longford — wins: 5, draws: 1
- Hillwood — wins: 1, draws: 1

2) Identify any team(s) with exactly 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws
SQL:
SELECT "ntfa div 1", wins, draws FROM my_info_table WHERE wins = 8 AND draws < 2;
Result:
- Scottsdale — wins: 8, draws: 0

3) George Town’s wins and draws (case-insensitive exact name match)
SQL:
SELECT wins, draws FROM my_info_table WHERE "ntfa div 1" ILIKE 'George Town';
Result:
- George Town — wins: 9, draws: 1

Assessment:
- George Town does not have 8 wins; it has 9 wins and 1 draw.
- The team that has exactly 8 wins and fewer than 2 draws is Scottsdale (8 wins, 0 draws).

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “NTFA div 1” refers to the table my_info_table’s "ntfa div 1" column representing NTFA Division 1 team names in the provided dataset.
- “8 win and less than 2 draw” is interpreted as exactly 8 wins and draws < 2.
- No specific season was provided; verification is based on the standing snapshot present in the dataset.
