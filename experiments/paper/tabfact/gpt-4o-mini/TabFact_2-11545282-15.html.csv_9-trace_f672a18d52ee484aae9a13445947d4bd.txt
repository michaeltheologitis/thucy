Claim interpreted: “Dan O’Sullivan went to Kansas and played the center position.”

Data source consulted
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team). Treated as authoritative per instructions.

Evidence
1) Identify Dan O’Sullivan’s entry and core details
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%sullivan%';
- Result (single matching row):
  - Player: Dan O'Sullivan
  - Nationality: United States
  - Position: Center
  - Years for Jazz: 1990 - 91
  - School / Club Team: Fordham

2) Check specifically for any O’Sullivan with school containing “Kansas”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%sullivan%' AND "school / club team" ILIKE '%Kansas%';
- Result: No rows returned

Findings
- Position: Center — Supported by the roster entry.
- School: Kansas — Not supported; the database lists Fordham for Dan O’Sullivan, and there are no O’Sullivan entries with a school containing “Kansas”.

Conclusion
- The claim is mixed: “played the center position” is true; “went to Kansas” is false according to the available data.

Assumptions
- “go to Kansas” is interpreted as attending the University of Kansas as his school/college.
- “Dan O’Sullivan” refers to the player found in the Utah Jazz all-time roster database.
