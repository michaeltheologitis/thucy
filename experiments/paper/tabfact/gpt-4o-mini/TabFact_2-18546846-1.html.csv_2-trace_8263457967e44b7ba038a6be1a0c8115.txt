Claim interpreted: “August 31, 1947 is the date of the first game of the season.” Based on the available data source covering the 1947 San Francisco 49ers season, we verify whether their first game date is August 31, 1947.

Findings supported by executed SQL:

1) Earliest game chronologically (casting the stored text date to a real date)
- Result: Week 1, Date: August 31, 1947, Opponent: Brooklyn Dodgers, Result: W, Score: 23 - 7
- Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, result, score FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season ORDER BY to_date(date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') ASC LIMIT 1;

2) Compute the earliest date in canonical format
- Result: 1947-08-31
- Executed SQL:
SELECT MIN(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY')) AS earliest_game_date FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season;

3) Cross-check by Week 1 row
- Result: Date: August 31, 1947; Opponent: Brooklyn Dodgers; Result: W
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, result FROM public.t_1947_san_francisco_49ers_season WHERE week = 1;

Conclusion: The data shows the San Francisco 49ers’ 1947 season opened on August 31, 1947.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity:
- “the season” is interpreted as the 1947 season of the San Francisco 49ers, because the accessible database contains a specific table for that team/season. If a different team or league was intended, results may differ.
- The date column in the available table is stored as text (e.g., “August 31, 1947”), so conversion to a date was used for proper chronological ordering.
