Claim interpreted: The user asserts that there were 2 Zakspeed chassis made/recorded for the year 1987.

Data sources explored:
- Available PostgreSQL database with a table: public.zakspeed
- Table schema (from schema inspection): columns = year (bigint), chassis (text), "engine (s)" (text), tyres (text), points (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count of distinct chassis strings for 1987
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT chassis) AS distinct_chassis_count
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987;
- Result: 1 distinct chassis string

2) The exact chassis string recorded for 1987
- SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT chassis
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987;
- Result: zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871

3) Count occurrences of the substring 'zakspeed ' within the 1987 chassis string (to infer number of chassis listed)
- SQL:
  SELECT chassis, (LENGTH(chassis) - LENGTH(REPLACE(chassis, 'zakspeed ', ''))) / LENGTH('zakspeed ') AS occurrences
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987;
- Result: occurrences = 2, chassis = 'zakspeed 861 zakspeed 871'

4) Extract each chassis mention for 1987 via regex
- SQL:
  SELECT UNNEST(REGEXP_MATCHES(chassis, '(zakspeed\s+\d+)', 'g')) AS chassis_match
  FROM public.zakspeed
  WHERE year = 1987;
- Result rows:
  - zakspeed 861
  - zakspeed 871

Conclusion:
- The 1987 entry explicitly lists two chassis: zakspeed 861 and zakspeed 871. Therefore, the claim that there were 2 Zakspeed chassis in 1987 is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The chassis field lists the chassis models associated with that year, and multiple mentions within the field indicate multiple chassis for that year. Counting repeated 'zakspeed ' tokens or extracting '(zakspeed\s+\d+)' matches is a valid way to determine the number of chassis recorded for 1987.
