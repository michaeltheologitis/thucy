Claim to verify: "8 game have an attendance of over 70000 during the 1993 New York Jet season"

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL, schema: public
- Relevant table identified: t_1993_new_york_jets_season (historical data for the 1993 New York Jets season)

Schema understanding (from the database)
- week (bigint): Week number of the season
- date (text): Date of the game
- opponent (text): Opposing team name
- result (text): Outcome of the game
- "game site" (text): Location of the game
- attendance (bigint): Number of attendees

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count of games with attendance strictly greater than 70,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS attendance_count FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000;
- Result: 7

2) List of games with attendance strictly greater than 70,000 (for transparency)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season WHERE attendance > 70000 ORDER BY week ASC;
- Result rows:
  - Week 2 | 1993 - 09 - 12 | Miami Dolphins | Joe Robbie Stadium | 70314
  - Week 5 | 1993 - 10 - 03 | Philadelphia Eagles | The Meadowlands | 72593
  - Week 8 | 1993 - 10 - 24 | Buffalo Bills | The Meadowlands | 71541
  - Week 9 | 1993 - 10 - 31 | New York Giants | Giants Stadium | 71659
  - Week 10 | 1993 - 11 - 07 | Miami Dolphins | The Meadowlands | 71306
  - Week 16 | 1993 - 12 - 18 | Dallas Cowboys | The Meadowlands | 73233
  - Week 17 | 1993 - 12 - 26 | Buffalo Bills | Rich Stadium | 70817

3) Total number of games in the 1993 New York Jets season (for context)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season;
- Result: 16

4) Boundary check: games with attendance greater than or equal to 70,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count 
  FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE attendance >= 70000;
- Result: 7
- Executed SQL to list those games:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", attendance 
  FROM t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
  WHERE attendance >= 70000 
  ORDER BY week;
- Result rows are identical to those in step 2.

Conclusion
- The data show 7 games with attendance over 70,000 (and also 7 with attendance at least 70,000). The claim of 8 such games is not supported.

Assumptions
- "Over 70000" is interpreted as strictly greater than 70,000.
- "1993 New York Jet season" refers to the regular-season schedule represented in the table (16 games).
