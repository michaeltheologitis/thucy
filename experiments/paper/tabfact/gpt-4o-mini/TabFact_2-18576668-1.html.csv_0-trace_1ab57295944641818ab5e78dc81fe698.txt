Summary
Claim: “25–26 January 2003 and 12–13 July 2003 be the only game play in 2003.”
Finding: Supported by the data in the TabFact database table tsuyoshi_fujita. The only rows dated in calendar year 2003 are exactly those two date ranges.

Data discovery
- Available source: Database: TabFact; Schema: public; Table: tsuyoshi_fujita
  - Columns: season (text), event type (text), location (text), format (text), date (text), rank (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify available seasons
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT season FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY season;
Result (sorted): 1997 - 98; 1998 - 99; 1999 - 00; 2000 - 01; 2001 - 02; 2002 - 03; 2003 - 04; 2005; 2011
Interpretation: Calendar year 2003 could include parts of seasons “2002 - 03” and “2003 - 04”.

2) Retrieve all rows with dates containing ‘2003’
SQL:
SELECT season, date, "event type", location, format, rank 
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita 
WHERE date LIKE '%2003%' 
ORDER BY date;
Results:
- Season: 2002 - 03; Date: 25 - 26 January 2003; Event Type: Grand Prix; Location: Hiroshima; Format: Extended; Rank: 7
- Season: 2002 - 03; Date: 12 - 13 July 2003; Event Type: Grand Prix; Location: Bangkok; Format: Standard; Rank: 1
Interpretation: Only two entries contain the year 2003, matching the claimed date ranges.

3) Cross-check all distinct dates recorded
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT date FROM tsuyoshi_fujita ORDER BY date;
Results (excerpt, full list follows):
- 12 - 13 July 2003
- 25 - 26 January 2003
Full list returned: 10 - 12 June 2011; 11 - 12 May 2002; 11 - 12 November 2000; 11 - 13 January 2002; 11 - 13 June 2004; 12 - 13 February 2000; 12 - 13 July 2003; 12 - 13 October 2002; 16 - 17 February 2002; 16 - 17 January 1999; 16 - 18 March 2001; 17 - 18 November 2001; 17 - 20 May 2005; 24 - 25 July 2004; 25 - 26 January 2003; 27 - 28 January 2001; 27 - 28 March 1999; 28 - 30 October 2005; 4 - 5 July 1998; 5 - 6 March 2005; 8 - 10 July 2005
Interpretation: The only dates in 2003 are exactly the two claimed ranges.

4) Confirm no 2003-dated rows within the “2003 - 04” season
SQL:
SELECT date, "event type", location, format, rank FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season = '2003 - 04' ORDER BY date;
Results:
- 11 - 13 June 2004; Event Type: Nationals; Location: Osaka; Format: Special; Rank: 1
- 24 - 25 July 2004; Event Type: Grand Prix; Location: Kuala Lumpur; Format: Standard; Rank: 4
Interpretation: No entries in late 2003; all are in 2004.

Conclusion
Based on the table tsuyoshi_fujita, the only recorded events occurring in calendar year 2003 are on 25–26 January 2003 and 12–13 July 2003. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “game play” is interpreted as any recorded event row in the tsuyoshi_fujita table.
- “in 2003” refers to the calendar year 2003, as indicated by the year embedded in the date field.
