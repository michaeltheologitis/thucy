Claim to verify: "australia receive 0 gold medal and more than 1 bronze"

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database with schema public
- Table: public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships (columns: rank [text], nation [text], gold [bigint], silver [bigint], bronze [bigint], total [bigint])

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Retrieve Australia’s medal counts
SQL:
SELECT nation, gold, bronze, silver, total
FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships
WHERE LOWER(nation) = LOWER('Australia') OR LOWER(nation) = LOWER('AUS');
Result summary: Australia — Gold: 0, Bronze: 1, Silver: 0, Total: 1

2) Return the exact row for Australia
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2003_world_taekwondo_championships WHERE LOWER(nation) = LOWER('Australia') OR LOWER(nation) = LOWER('AUS');
Row returned:
- Rank: 18
- Nation: Australia
- Gold: 0
- Silver: 0
- Bronze: 1
- Total: 1

Assessment:
- The claim states Australia received 0 gold medals and more than 1 bronze medal.
- Data shows Australia received 0 gold medals (true) and 1 bronze medal (not more than 1).

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data because the bronze count is 1, not more than 1.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim in the context of the available dataset: the 2003 World Taekwondo Championships medal table, as it is the only accessible relevant data source.
