Summary of approach
- Discovered available data sources and inspected the schema to ground the verification.
- Queried the episode records to find any title matching both “fall” and “star” (case-insensitive) and retrieved its series number.

Data source and schema
- Data source: public PostgreSQL Database
- Table: my_info_table
  - Columns: episode (bigint), series (bigint), episode title (text), original air date (text), production code (bigint)

Evidence query and results
1) Find the episode title containing both “fall” and “star” and return its series number.
Executed SQL:
SELECT "episode title", series FROM my_info_table WHERE "episode title" ILIKE '%fall%' AND "episode title" ILIKE '%star%';
Result:
- Episode Title: the fallen star
- Series Number: 20

Conclusion
- The data shows an episode titled “the fallen star” with a series number of 20. This supports the claim that the series number is 20 for the referenced title.

Assumptions
- “the fall star” in the claim refers to the episode titled “the fallen star” found in my_info_table.
- “series number” corresponds to the column named “series” in my_info_table.
