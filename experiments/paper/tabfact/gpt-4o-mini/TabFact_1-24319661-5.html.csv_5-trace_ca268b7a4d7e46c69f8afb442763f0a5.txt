Data sources explored
- Connected relational data sources were discovered. The available authoritative dataset relevant to TV episodes is a PostgreSQL table: public.list_of_white_collar_episodes.
- Table schema (key columns): "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), title (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "us viewers (million)" (double precision), "original air date" (text), "production code" (text).

1) Identify episodes directed by Robert Duncan McNeill and their production codes.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in season", "no in series", title, "directed by", "production code"

WHERE "production code" LIKE 'bcw4%' 
ORDER BY "no in series";
