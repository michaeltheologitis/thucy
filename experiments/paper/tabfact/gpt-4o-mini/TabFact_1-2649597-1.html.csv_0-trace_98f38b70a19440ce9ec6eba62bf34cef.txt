Claim: “Shane Hall ran a total of 190 races between the year of 1995 - 2008.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: shane_hall
- Table: shane_hall with columns: year (bigint), races (bigint), wins (bigint), poles (bigint), top 5 (bigint), top 10 (bigint), dnf (bigint), finish (double precision), start (double precision), winnings (bigint), season rank (text), team (s) (text)

Evidence collected
1) Per-year races between 1995 and 2008 (inclusive)
- Result:
  - 1995: 2
  - 1996: 14
  - 1997: 28
  - 1998: 31
  - 1999: 25
  - 2000: 2
  - 2001: 33
  - 2002: 24
  - 2003: 5
  - 2004: 9
  - 2005: 7
  - 2006: 9
  - 2008: 1
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, races 
  FROM shane_hall 
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008 
  ORDER BY year;

2) Total races from 1995 through 2008 (inclusive)
- Result: 190 races
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT SUM(races) AS total_races
  FROM shane_hall
  WHERE year BETWEEN 1995 AND 2008;

Conclusion
- The sum of races for the years 1995–2008 inclusive is 190, matching the claim.

Assumptions
- “Ran a total of X races” is interpreted as the sum of the “races” column for the specified years in the shane_hall table.
- Inclusion is for all years 1995 through 2008 (inclusive). There is no row for 2007 in the dataset, implying zero races recorded for that year within this source.
