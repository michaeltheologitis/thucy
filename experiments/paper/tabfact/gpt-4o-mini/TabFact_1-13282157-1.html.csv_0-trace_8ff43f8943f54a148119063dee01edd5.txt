Summary
- Claim interpreted as: Is the United States the home country of the 8th-ranked player in the available 2007 FedEx Cup playoffs dataset?
- Data source: public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs (trusted as authoritative per instructions)

Method
- Determine rank by ordering players by points in descending order, breaking ties deterministically by player name (ascending). Retrieve the 8th row and inspect its country.

Evidence
1) Query to fetch the 8th position by points (with deterministic tie-break by player name):
SQL:
SELECT player, country, points, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC, player ASC) AS pos
FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
ORDER BY pos
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 7;

Result:
- Player: Charles Howell III
- Country: United States
- Points: 12126
- Position (pos): 8

2) Cross-check using rank function (ordered by points desc, then player asc) to align with ranking-by-points interpretation:
SQL:
SELECT player, country, points, RANK() OVER (ORDER BY points DESC, player ASC) AS computed_rank
FROM public.t_2007_fedex_cup_playoffs
ORDER BY computed_rank
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 7;

Result:
- Player: Charles Howell III
- Country: United States
- Points: 12126
- Computed_rank: 8

Conclusion
- The 8th-ranked player (by points) is Charles Howell III, whose home country in the dataset is listed as United States. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “8th-ranked” refers to ordering by total points in the 2007 FedEx Cup playoffs dataset and, where needed, ties are broken by player name ascending to produce a unique 8th row.
- “United state” is interpreted as “United States.”
