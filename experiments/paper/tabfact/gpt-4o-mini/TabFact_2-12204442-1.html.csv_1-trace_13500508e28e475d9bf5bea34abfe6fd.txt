Summary
The claim states that the speed of a giant drop attraction with a 200-foot drop is 62 mph. Evidence from the available ride dataset shows an entry with a 200-foot drop height and a recorded speed of 62 mph, supporting the claim.

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Query: find all entries with speed = '62 mph'
SQL:
SELECT park, "drop height", speed FROM drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE speed = '62 mph';
Results:
- Park: Canada 's Wonderland | Drop Height: 200 feet | Speed: 62 mph
- Park: California 's Great America | Drop Height: 207 feet | Speed: 62 mph

2) Query: find entries where the drop height contains '200'
SQL:
SELECT park, "drop height", speed FROM drop_tower_scream_zone WHERE "drop height" LIKE '%200%';
Results:
- Park: Canada 's Wonderland | Drop Height: 200 feet | Speed: 62 mph

Assessment
- The dataset contains a ride entry with a 200-foot drop height and a speed of 62 mph (Canada’s Wonderland). This directly supports the claim.
- Additional corroboration: another ride with a nearby drop height (207 feet) also lists a speed of 62 mph, consistent with the stated speed for around 200-foot drops.

Conclusion
Based on the data, a giant drop-style attraction with a 200-foot drop has a recorded speed of 62 mph.

Assumptions
- "Giant drop attraction" is interpreted generically as a drop tower-style ride (the dataset table is named drop_tower_scream_zone and does not include a ride-name column). The verification is tied to the Canada’s Wonderland entry with a 200-foot drop and 62 mph speed.
