Objective
Verify the claim: “Michael Schumacher (constructor: Ferrari) has an average grid number of 1 with time/retire of 1:32:35.101.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: t_2004_european_grand_prix
  - Columns: driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Evidence
1) Identify Ferrari entries (confirms Michael Schumacher’s row and values)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, grid, "time / retired" 
  FROM public.t_2004_european_grand_prix 
  WHERE constructor ILIKE '%Ferrari%';
- Result excerpts:
  - Driver: Michael Schumacher | Constructor: Ferrari | Grid: 1 | Time / Retired: 1:32:35.101
  - Driver: Rubens Barrichello | Constructor: Ferrari | Grid: 7 | Time / Retired: + 17.989

2) Retrieve Michael Schumacher’s specific record
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, constructor, grid, "time / retired" 
  FROM public.t_2004_european_grand_prix 
  WHERE driver ILIKE '%Michael Schumacher%';
- Result:
  - Driver: Michael Schumacher | Constructor: Ferrari | Grid: 1 | Time / Retired: 1:32:35.101

3) Compute average grid for Michael Schumacher (within this table)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT AVG(grid) AS avg_grid 
  FROM t_2004_european_grand_prix 
  WHERE driver ILIKE '%Michael Schumacher%';
- Result:
  - avg_grid = 1.00

Assessment of the claim
- “Driver whose constructor is Ferrari”: Supported (Michael Schumacher’s constructor is Ferrari).
- “Average grid number of 1”: Supported (only one record for Schumacher in this table; AVG(grid) = 1.00).
- “Time/retire of 1:32:35.101”: Supported (exact match in the “time / retired” column for Schumacher).

Conclusion
All components of the claim are supported by the data in the t_2004_european_grand_prix table.

Assumptions
- The claim pertains to the data available in the TabFact.public.t_2004_european_grand_prix table (2004 European Grand Prix). “Average grid number” is interpreted as the average of the grid values for Michael Schumacher’s entries in this specific table (which contains one entry for him). “Time/retire” corresponds to the “time / retired” column value for that entry.
