Data source discovery
- Available data source: A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season (2007 Uni-President Lions season logs).

  - No primary keys or relationships
  - Player names (if recorded) appear only in the free-text fields loss and save

Evidence
1) Identify opponent naming present in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT opponent FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season;
- Result (excerpt relevant to claim): Chinatrust Whales (among others)

2) Count games by opponent to confirm presence of Chinatrust Whales matchups
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS game_count 
  FROM public.t_2007_uni_president_lions_season 
  GROUP BY opponent 
  ORDER BY game_count DESC;

3) List all games vs Chinatrust Whales and check pitcher fields
- Executed SQL:

- Result:
  - Date: 3 / 22 | Opponent: chinatrust whales | Score: 7 - 9 | Loss: kao lung - wei | Save: ni fu - deh

Assessment
- The dataset records a game on 3/22 against the Chinatrust Whales in which the losing pitcher is listed as “kao lung - wei.” This supports the claim that the Chinatrust Whales played against (and in that game, defeated) a team with the losing pitcher named Kao Lung-Wei.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the user’s fragment “chinatrust whale play against kao lung - wei” as asking whether there exists a recorded game against the Chinatrust Whales where “kao lung - wei” is implicated (e.g., as the losing pitcher). The table covers only the Uni-President Lions’ 2007 season, so verification is constrained to that context.
