Claim: "only 1 of the viral disease have a spherical virion shape"

Data sources explored
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence gathered
1) Distinct virion shapes and counts
- Result: Spherical appears exactly 1 time among distinct shapes.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS "count"
  FROM viral_disease
  GROUP BY "virion shape";

2) Exact case-insensitive match to 'spherical'
- Result: 1 record matches exactly; family = 'unassigned'.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS record_count, family FROM viral_disease WHERE LOWER("virion shape") = LOWER('spherical') GROUP BY family;

3) Substring match containing the word 'spherical' (case-insensitive)
- Result: 1 total record contains 'spherical'; distinct matching shape = 'spherical' with count 1.
- Executed SQL:
  -- Total records containing 'spherical'
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%spherical%';

  -- Distinct matching shapes with counts
  SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.viral_disease
  WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%spherical%'
  GROUP BY "virion shape";

Conclusion
- The data shows exactly one record in the viral_disease table with a spherical virion shape. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the count of records in the public.viral_disease table where the "virion shape" value is labeled 'spherical'.
- Considered both exact (case-insensitive) equality and substring matching to ensure no alternate casing or composite labels were missed.
- Treated the available database as authoritative and complete for this verification.
