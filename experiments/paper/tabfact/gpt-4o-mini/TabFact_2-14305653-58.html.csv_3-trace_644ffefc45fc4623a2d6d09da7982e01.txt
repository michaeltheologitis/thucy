Claim interpreted: The Yugoslavia national team failed to score only once in World Cup qualifying, specifically in a 0:2 loss to Italy.

Data source explored
- Table: yugoslavia_national_football_team_results (columns: date, city, opponent, results, type of game)

Step 1: Identify how World Cup qualifiers are labeled
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "type of game" FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results ORDER BY 1;
Result:
- 1982 WCQ
- Balkan Cup
- Friendly

Step 2: List all matches labeled as 1982 WCQ
SQL executed:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game" 
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results 
WHERE lower("type of game") LIKE '%1982%wcq%' 
ORDER BY date ASC;
Results:
- Date: November 15 | City: Torino, Italy | Opponent: Italy | Results: 0:2 | Type of Game: 1982 WCQ
- Date: September 10 | City: Luxembourg | Opponent: Luxembourg | Results: 5:0 | Type of Game: 1982 WCQ
- Date: September 27 | City: Ljubljana | Opponent: Denmark | Results: 2:1 | Type of Game: 1982 WCQ

Step 3: Count 1982 WCQ matches where Yugoslavia failed to score (results starting with '0:')
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS failed_to_score_wcq_1982
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE lower("type of game") LIKE '%1982%wcq%'
  AND results LIKE '0:%';
Result:
- failed_to_score_wcq_1982 = 1

Step 4: List the specific 1982 WCQ match(es) where Yugoslavia failed to score
SQL executed:
SELECT date, city, opponent, results, "type of game"
FROM yugoslavia_national_football_team_results
WHERE lower("type of game") LIKE '%1982%wcq%'
  AND results LIKE '0:%';
Result:
- Date: November 15 | City: Torino, Italy | Opponent: Italy | Results: 0:2 | Type of Game: 1982 WCQ

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (which contains 1982 World Cup Qualifier entries), Yugoslavia failed to score exactly once in WCQ, in a 0:2 loss to Italy in Torino. This matches the user’s claim.

Assumptions
- "Fail to score only 1 time" is interpreted within the scope of the available World Cup qualifier data in this table, which labels WCQ matches as "1982 WCQ" and does not include other qualification campaigns.
- "Fail to score" is determined by results strings beginning with "0:" (Yugoslavia’s goals listed first).
