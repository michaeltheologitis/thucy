Claim checked: “the imperial value for 厘 and 分 be not equal.”

Data source explored
- Database: public
- Table: chinese_units_of_measurement
- Relevant columns: character (Chinese unit name), jyutping, relative value, metric value, imperial value

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieved both units’ records
SQL executed:
SELECT character, jyutping, "relative value", "metric value", "imperial value" 
FROM chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE character IN ('厘', '分')

Result (relevant fields):
- 厘: imperial value = ~0.2133 dr; metric value = 37.79931 mg; relative value = 1 / 1600
- 分: imperial value = ~0.2133 dr; metric value = 377.9936375 mg; relative value = 1 / 1600

2) Counted distinct imperial values across the two units
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT "imperial value") AS distinct_imperial_count 
FROM chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE "character" IN ('厘', '分');

Result: 1 distinct imperial value

3) Retrieved the distinct imperial value
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "imperial value" 
FROM chinese_units_of_measurement 
WHERE "character" IN ('厘', '分');

Result: ~0.2133 dr

Conclusion
- According to the authoritative database, both 厘 and 分 have the same imperial value (~0.2133 dr). Therefore, the claim that their imperial values are not equal is contradicted by the data.

Notes/assumptions
- “Imperial value” is interpreted as the value in the table’s “imperial value” column (here expressed in drams, “dr”).
- The verification is performed strictly against the provided database values, which are treated as authoritative per instructions.
