Based on the 1961 VFL season dataset (table public.t_1961_vfl_season), Lake Oval shows a lower recorded crowd attendance than Glenferrie Oval.

Evidence and queries
1) Establish venue-level attendance stats across the dataset
- Result (excerpt for relevant venues):
  • Lake Oval — match_count: 1, min_crowd: 14500, max_crowd: 14500, avg_crowd: 14500
  • Glenferrie Oval — match_count: 1, min_crowd: 15000, max_crowd: 15000, avg_crowd: 15000
- SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count, MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS avg_crowd 
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season 
GROUP BY venue;

2) Targeted comparison for Lake Oval vs Glenferrie Oval
- Result:
  • Lake Oval — match_count: 1, min/avg/max crowd: 14500
  • Glenferrie Oval — match_count: 1, min/avg/max crowd: 15000
- SQL:
SELECT venue, COUNT(*) AS match_count, MIN(crowd) AS min_crowd, MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd, AVG(crowd) AS avg_crowd
FROM public.t_1961_vfl_season
WHERE venue ILIKE '%lake oval%' OR venue ILIKE '%glenferrie oval%'
GROUP BY venue;

Interpretation
In the available 1961 season data, Lake Oval’s recorded crowd (14,500) is lower than Glenferrie Oval’s (15,000). Since there is one recorded match per venue in this dataset, the average, minimum, and maximum values coincide with the single observed attendance for each venue.

Assumptions
- “Crowd participation” is interpreted as the attendance recorded in the crowd column.
- “Record” refers to the values present in the 1961 VFL dataset available (not across all seasons).
- The comparison is based on the observed attendance for 1961 (one match per venue in this table).
