Claim to verify: “Galina Voskoboeva plays 20% of her games on clay and 1% on hard.”

Data source overview:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: galina_voskoboeva
  - Columns: outcome (text), date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Evidence gathered via executed SQL:
1) Surface distribution with counts and percentages
SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS match_count, COUNT(*) * 100.0 / SUM(COUNT(*)) OVER () AS percentage_of_total
FROM galina_voskoboeva
GROUP BY surface;
Results:
- Surface: Hard (i) | Match Count: 2 | Percentage of Total: 40%
- Surface: Hard     | Match Count: 1 | Percentage of Total: 20%
- Surface: Clay     | Match Count: 2 | Percentage of Total: 40%

2) Total matches
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM galina_voskoboeva;
Result:
- Total matches: 5

3) Surface counts (raw)
SQL:
SELECT surface, COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM galina_voskoboeva GROUP BY surface;
Results:
- Hard (i): 2
- Hard: 1
- Clay: 2

Assessment:
- Clay share: 2/5 = 40%, not 20%.
- Hard share: if considering only rows labeled “Hard,” 1/5 = 20%; if combining all hard courts (Hard + Hard (i)), (1+2)/5 = 60%. In neither interpretation is the hard share close to 1%.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the data in the galina_voskoboeva table. She has approximately 40% of matches on clay and 20% on hard (or 60% if including “Hard (i)” as hard), not 20% clay and 1% hard.

Assumptions:
- The public.galina_voskoboeva table represents the authoritative set of matches considered for this verification.
- “Hard (i)” indicates indoor hard and is either treated separately (as listed) or, when appropriate, combined with “Hard” under the broader hard-court category. The conclusion holds in both interpretations.
