Claim assessed: "tiger wood score be 205"

Data sources explored
- Available database: public schema with a table t_2002_u_s_open_golf (2002 U.S. Open golf tournament data). Columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text).

Evidence from data
- I searched for the player entry containing "Woods" in the 2002 U.S. Open table to verify Tiger Woods’ recorded score.

Executed SQL and results
- SQL:
  SELECT player, place, score, "to par" FROM t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Woods%';

- Result (as returned by the database):
  player: tiger woods
  place: 1
  score: 67 + 68 + 70 = 205
  to par: - 5

Conclusion
- The dataset explicitly records Tiger Woods’ score as "67 + 68 + 70 = 205" in the 2002 U.S. Open table. Therefore, within this data source, the statement that Tiger Woods’ score is 205 is supported.

Assumptions
- Because the user’s claim lacks context (event and round), I interpret it with respect to the only available authoritative dataset (2002 U.S. Open). The score field appears to reflect the cumulative total shown as "67 + 68 + 70 = 205" in that dataset.
