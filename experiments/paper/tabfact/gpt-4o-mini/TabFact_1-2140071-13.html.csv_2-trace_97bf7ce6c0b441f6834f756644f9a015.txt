- Relevant table: made_tv_series
- Columns: season (bigint), episode (bigint), episode summary (text), premier date (text), external link (text), coach (text)
- No declared primary or foreign keys.

Evidence 1: List all episodes numbered 5
- Result: Season 13, Episode 5 has episode summary: “Rita is made into an actress.”

Assessment
- The database records Season 13, Episode 5 with the episode summary exactly “Rita is made into an actress.” While the column is labeled “episode summary,” in this dataset it matches the phrasing typically used as the episode’s display title for this series. This directly supports the claim that episode 5 is titled (or described as) “Rita is made into an actress.”

Conclusion
- The evidence supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- The table made_tv_series represents the MTV series “Made.”
- The “episode summary” field reflects the episode’s displayed title/description for the purposes of this verification.
- “Episode 5” is interpreted as episode number within its season (Season 13), consistent with the dataset.
