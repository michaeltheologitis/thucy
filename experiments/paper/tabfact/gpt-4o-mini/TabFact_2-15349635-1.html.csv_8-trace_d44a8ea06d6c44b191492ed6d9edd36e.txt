Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the available data. In the 1940 Brazilian football dataset (table public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football), no single goals-against value is shared by more than three teams; the maximum number of teams sharing the same goals-against value is two.

Evidence from data and executed SQL:

1) Distribution of goals-against values by number of teams
- Executed SQL:
SELECT against, COUNT(team) AS team_count
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY against
ORDER BY team_count DESC, against ASC;
- Result returned:
against | team_count
15      | 2
19      | 2
25      | 2
12      | 1
23      | 1
24      | 1
This shows the highest count for any single goals-against value is 2, not over 3.

2) Teams sharing each goals-against value
- Executed SQL:
SELECT against, COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS team_count, ARRAY_AGG(team) AS team_names
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
GROUP BY against
ORDER BY team_count DESC, against ASC;
- Result returned (abridged to highlight duplicates):
15 → count 2 → team_names: [corinthians, fluminense]
19 → count 2 → team_names: [palestra itália, vasco da gama]
25 → count 2 → team_names: [américa, botafogo]
12 → count 1 → [flamengo]
23 → count 1 → [portuguesa]
24 → count 1 → [são paulo]
Again, no goals-against value is shared by more than two teams.

3) Alternative check (if interpreting the claim as “more than three teams have a non-unique goals-against value”):
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS total_non_unique_teams
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
WHERE against IN (
    SELECT against
    FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football
    GROUP BY against
    HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
);
- Result returned: 6
Interpretation note: While six teams in total have non-unique goals-against values (they form three pairs), there is no single goals-against number shared by more than three teams.

Verdict: No goals-against number is shared by over three teams in this dataset, so the claim is not supported.

Assumptions and scope:
- I interpret “over 3 team have the same number of goal score against them” to mean there exists at least one goals-against value that is shared by more than three teams (i.e., ≥4 teams share the same number). Under this interpretation, the claim is false.
- Data scope is limited to the authoritative dataset available: public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football. Within this scope, results are definitive.
- “against” is taken to mean goals conceded (goals scored against the team).
