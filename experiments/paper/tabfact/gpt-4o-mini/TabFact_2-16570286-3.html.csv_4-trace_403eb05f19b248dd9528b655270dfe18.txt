Scope and data discovery
- I explored the available data sources and found a PostgreSQL database named TabFact with a single relevant table in the public schema: t_1948_ashes_series, which contains per-player statistics for the 1948 Ashes series. Columns: player, team, matches, wickets, average, best bowling.

Evidence gathered from queries
1) Sample of rows (shows player-level figures and includes Alec Bedser and other England players):
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series LIMIT 20;
Results excerpt:
- Ray Lindwall | Australia | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 27 | Average: 19.62 | Best Bowling: 6 / 20
- Bill Johnston | Australia | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 27 | Average: 23.33 | Best Bowling: 5 / 36
- Alec Bedser | England | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 18 | Average: 38.22 | Best Bowling: 4 / 81
- Keith Miller | Australia | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 13 | Average: 23.15 | Best Bowling: 4 / 125
- Ernie Toshack | Australia | Matches: 4 | Wickets: 11 | Average: 33.09 | Best Bowling: 5 / 40
- Norman Yardley | England | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 9 | Average: 22.66 | Best Bowling: 2 / 32
- Jim Laker | England | Matches: 3 | Wickets: 9 | Average: 52.44 | Best Bowling: 4 / 138

2) Distinct team values and counts (confirms England entries exist in this table):
SQL executed:
SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS team_count FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series GROUP BY team;
Results:
- England | 3
- Australia | 4

3) Direct lookup for Alec Bedser (confirms his series bowling average in this dataset):
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1948_ashes_series WHERE player ILIKE '%Bedser%';
Result:
- Alec Bedser | England | Matches: 5 | Wickets: 18 | Average: 38.22 | Best Bowling: 4 / 81

Assessment against the claim
- Claim: “alec bedser have the best bowling average of any england player.”
- In the only available authoritative dataset (the 1948 Ashes series), Alec Bedser’s bowling average is 38.22. Another England player in the same dataset, Norman Yardley, has a significantly better (lower) bowling average of 22.66. This single counterexample within the dataset is sufficient to refute the claim as scoped to the available data.

Conclusion
- Based on the 1948 Ashes series data, Alec Bedser did not have the best bowling average among England players in that series. At least Norman Yardley had a better bowling average.

Assumptions
- Because the accessible, authoritative data source only contains the 1948 Ashes series, I interpreted the claim within the scope of this dataset. “Best bowling average” is taken to mean the lowest bowling average among England players in this table. No external data beyond the provided database was used.
