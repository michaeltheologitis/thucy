Claim to verify: “there be 3 624 000 live birth per year in the period from 1975 to 1980.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database: TabFact, schema: public, with table: my_info_table containing demographic statistics, including a column “live births per year”.

Relevant schema (from the data source)
- Table: my_info_table
  - period (text)
  - live births per year (text)
  - deaths per year (text)
  - natural change per year (text)
  - cbr (double precision)
  - cdr (double precision)
  - nc (double precision)
  - tfr (double precision)
  - imr (bigint)
  - life expectancy total (double precision)
  - life expectancy males (double precision)
  - life expectancy females (double precision)

Evidence 1: Value for 1975–1980
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE period = '1975 - 1980'
- Result (key fields):
  - period: 1975 - 1980
  - live births per year: 3,741,000
  - deaths per year: 1,043,000
  - natural change per year: 2,698,000
  - cbr: 32.5; cdr: 9; nc: 23.5; tfr: 4.31; imr: 79; life expectancy total: 61.5; males: 59.2; females: 63.9
- Interpretation: For the period 1975–1980, the recorded “live births per year” is 3,741,000, not 3,624,000.

Evidence 2: Does any period have 3,624,000 “live births per year”?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT period FROM my_info_table WHERE "live births per year" = '3,624,000' OR "live births per year" = '3 624 000'
- Result:
  - period: 1995 - 2000
- Follow-up check for that period:
  - Executed SQL:
    SELECT * FROM my_info_table WHERE period = '1995 - 2000';
  - Result (key fields): live births per year: 3,624,000; deaths per year: 1,086,000; natural change per year: 2,538,000; cbr: 21.5; cdr: 6.5; nc: 15.1; tfr: 2.45; imr: 34; life expectancy total: 69.3; males: 65.5; females: 73.3
- Interpretation: The value 3,624,000 appears for the period 1995–2000, not 1975–1980.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows 3,741,000 live births per year in 1975–1980. The claimed figure (3,624,000) corresponds to a different period (1995–2000). Therefore, the claim for 1975–1980 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Live birth per year” is interpreted as the dataset’s “live births per year” metric (average annual value for the stated multi-year period) in the only available authoritative table. No additional geographic context is provided; verification is strictly against this dataset’s values for the named period.
