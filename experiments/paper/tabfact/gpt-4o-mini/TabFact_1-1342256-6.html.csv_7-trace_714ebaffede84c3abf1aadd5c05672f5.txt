Summary of approach
- Discovered the available data source and its scope, then examined the schema to understand relevant columns. Verified the claim by querying rows where the column "first elected" equals 1926 and checking the associated party values.

Data source discovered
- A PostgreSQL database with a single relevant table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 (US House elections, 1942).

Relevant schema (from schema inspection)
- Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (text), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Distinct parties and counts for records where "first elected" = 1926
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT party, COUNT(*) AS count_per_party
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE "first elected" = '1926'
  GROUP BY party;
- Result: 1 record for the party "republican" (count_per_party = 1)

2) Total count of records where "first elected" = 1926
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  WHERE "first elected" = '1926';
- Result: total_count = 1

3) Full row(s) where "first elected" = 1926
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE "first elected" = '1926';
- Result (single row):
  - district: California 2
  - incumbent: Harry Lane Englebright
  - party: Republican
  - first elected: 1926
  - result: Re-elected
  - candidates: Harry Lane Englebright (R) unopposed

Conclusion
- The only record in this dataset with "first elected" = 1926 is associated with the Republican party, not the Democratic party. Therefore, the claim that “Democratic be the party with first elect be 1926” is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity
- Interpreted the phrase “first elect be 1926” to refer to the table’s "first elected" column equaling the year 1926.
- Interpreted the claim within the scope of the available dataset (United States House of Representatives elections, 1942), since no other data sources were available.
