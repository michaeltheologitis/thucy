Summary of findings
- The claim says: “NGC 1796 have the largest redshift at 633 km/s ± 6 km/s.”
- In the available Dorado Group dataset, NGC 1796 does not have 633 ± 6 km/s, nor is 633 km/s the largest redshift. The value 633 ± 6 km/s corresponds to NGC 1705. NGC 1796’s redshift is 1014 ± 9 km/s. The largest redshift in this table is 1510 ± 8 km/s (NGC 1596).

Evidence from the data (with executed SQL)
1) Data source overview (tables present)
- Purpose: Confirm the presence of the dorado_group table.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name 
  FROM information_schema.tables 
  WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;

  SELECT nspname AS table_schema, relname AS table_name, reltuples AS row_count 
  FROM pg_class 
  JOIN pg_namespace ON pg_namespace.oid = pg_class.relnamespace 
  WHERE relkind = 'r';

- Result excerpt indicated: Schema public has table dorado_group (18 rows).

2) List of galaxies and their redshifts
- Purpose: See all names and redshifts to identify values and spot NGC 1796.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, type, "redshift (km / s )" as redshift FROM public.dorado_group ORDER BY name;

- Result excerpt (relevant rows):
  - ngc 1705 … redshift: 633 ± 6
  - ngc 1796 … redshift: 1014 ± 9
  - ngc 1596 … redshift: 1510 ± 8
  - ngc 1566 … redshift: 1504 ± 2

3) Highest redshift objects (parsed numerically)
- Purpose: Determine which object(s) have the largest redshift in this dataset.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" AS redshift,
         CAST(substring("redshift (km / s )" FROM '^([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) AS redshift_kms
  FROM public.dorado_group
  ORDER BY redshift_kms DESC
  LIMIT 5;

- Result (top 5):
  1) NGC 1596 — 1510 ± 8 km/s
  2) NGC 1566 — 1504 ± 2 km/s
  3) NGC 1672 — 1331 ± 3 km/s
  4) NGC 1559 — 1304 ± 4 km/s
  5) NGC 1546 — 1284 ± 14 km/s

4) Specific check for NGC 1796
- Purpose: Verify the redshift value for NGC 1796.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" AS redshift
  FROM public.dorado_group
  WHERE LOWER(name) = 'ngc 1796';

- Result: NGC 1796 — 1014 ± 9 km/s

5) Specific check for NGC 1705 (to locate 633 ± 6)
- Purpose: Identify which galaxy has 633 ± 6 km/s.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "redshift (km / s )" AS redshift
  FROM public.dorado_group
  WHERE LOWER(name) = 'ngc 1705';

- Result: NGC 1705 — 633 ± 6 km/s

Conclusion
- The claim is incorrect on two counts within this dataset: (a) NGC 1796’s redshift is 1014 ± 9 km/s, not 633 ± 6 km/s; and (b) 633 km/s is not the largest redshift—several Dorado Group galaxies in this table have significantly higher values (up to 1510 ± 8 km/s).

Assumptions
- “Largest redshift” was interpreted as “largest redshift among galaxies listed in the available public.dorado_group dataset (Dorado Group).” If a different sample was intended, the conclusion pertains to this dataset only.
