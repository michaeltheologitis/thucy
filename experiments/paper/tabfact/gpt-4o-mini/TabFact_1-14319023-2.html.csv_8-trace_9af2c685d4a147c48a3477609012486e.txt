Claim interpreted: For the year 2009, the Girls Doubles winners were Anneke Feinya Agustin and Wenny Setiawati, and the Mixed Doubles winners were Wifqi Windarto and Debby Susanto.

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL with schema public
- Relevant table: indonesian_national_badminton_championships

Schema details (from tool)
- Columns: year (bigint), boys singles (text), girls singles (text), boys doubles (text), girls doubles (text), mixed doubles (text)

Evidence 1: 2009 winners in Girls Doubles and Mixed Doubles
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
  Result: Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia

  SELECT "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE year = 2009;
  Result: Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu

Finding: For 2009, the winners do not match the claim.

Evidence 2: Do the named pairs appear in other years?
- SQL executed (substring search, Girls Doubles):
  SELECT year, "girls doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "girls doubles" ILIKE '%anneke%' OR "girls doubles" ILIKE '%wenny%';
  Results:
  - 2007 | anneke feinya agustin wenny setiawati

- SQL executed (substring search, Mixed Doubles):
  SELECT year, "mixed doubles" FROM public.indonesian_national_badminton_championships WHERE "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%wifqi%' OR "mixed doubles" ILIKE '%debby%';
  Results:
  - 2006 | danny bawa chrisnanta debby susanto
  - 2007 | wifqi windarto debby susanto

Finding: The cited pairs did win, but in 2007 (and Debby Susanto appears also in 2006 with a different partner). They are not the 2009 winners.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim for the year 2009. The correct 2009 winners are Ayu Pratiwi and Anggi Widia (Girls Doubles) and Didit Juang Indrianto and Yayu Rahayu (Mixed Doubles). The claimed pairs correspond to 2007 winners.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “girl double” as the Girls Doubles category and “mixed double” as the Mixed Doubles category within the indonesian_national_badminton_championships table.
- Names are stored as simple text strings containing both partners in one field.
