Summary
- Claim: "in the period 2000 - 2005, there be a tfr of 2.25 and an nc of 13.4."
- Interpretation: For the period labeled “2000 - 2005” in the available dataset, Total Fertility Rate (tfr) is 2.25 and Natural Change (nc) is 13.4.

Data source discovery
- Available database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.my_info_table
- Relevant columns: period (text), tfr (double precision), nc (double precision), plus other demographic indicators.

Evidence
1) Retrieve TFR and NC for the specified period
SQL:
SELECT tfr, nc FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '2000 - 2005';
Result: tfr = 2.25, nc = 13.4

2) Ensure uniqueness of the period entry
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.my_info_table WHERE period = '2000 - 2005';
Result: row_count = 1

Conclusion
- The dataset reports tfr = 2.25 and nc = 13.4 for the period “2000 - 2005.” The claim exactly matches these values.

Assumptions
- “tfr” is interpreted as Total Fertility Rate and “nc” as Natural Change, consistent with the column names in public.my_info_table.
