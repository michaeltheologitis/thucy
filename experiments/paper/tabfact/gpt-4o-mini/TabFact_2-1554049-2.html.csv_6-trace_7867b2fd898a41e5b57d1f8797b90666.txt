Claim interpreted: “The surface for the opponent Roger Federer be clay after July 13, 2003.” Interpreted literally as: For matches in this dataset where the opponent is Roger Federer and the date is after 2003-07-13, the surface is clay.

Data source overview:
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table: public.ji_nov_k
- Columns: date (text), tournament (text), surface (text), opponent (text), score (text)

Evidence collection and executed SQL:
1) Enumerate tables
SQL:
SELECT table_schema, table_name 
FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' 
ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
Result: Shows user table public.ji_nov_k among system tables.

2) Inspect sample rows to understand date format
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, opponent, score FROM public.ji_nov_k LIMIT 20;
Key sample row observed:
- july 13 , 2003 | gstaad , switzerland | clay | roger federer | 5 - 7 , 6 - 3 , 6 - 3 , 1 - 6 , 6 - 3

3) Validate date parsing from text
SQL:
SELECT date, TO_DATE(date, 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') AS parsed_date 
FROM public.ji_nov_k 
LIMIT 10;
Result: Dates successfully parsed (e.g., 'july 13 , 2003' -> 2003-07-13).

4) Check matches where opponent is Roger Federer strictly after 2003-07-13
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, score 
FROM public.ji_nov_k 
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer' 
AND TO_DATE(date, 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') > DATE '2003-07-13';
Result: No matches found.

Auxiliary counts
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM public.ji_nov_k 
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer' 
AND TO_DATE(date, 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') > DATE '2003-07-13';
Result: 0

5) For context, check matches on or after 2003-07-13 (to capture the exact date mentioned)
SQL:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, score 
FROM public.ji_nov_k 
WHERE lower(opponent) = 'roger federer' 
AND TO_DATE(date, 'FMMonth DD , YYYY') >= DATE '2003-07-13';
Result: One match on 2003-07-13 at Gstaad (surface: clay).

Findings:
- There are zero matches in this dataset where the opponent is Roger Federer after (strictly later than) July 13, 2003. Therefore, there is no evidence that any post–July 13, 2003 match surface versus Roger Federer is clay.
- On the date July 13, 2003 itself, the match versus Roger Federer in this dataset was on clay (Gstaad, Switzerland), but that is not “after” the stated date.

Conclusion:
- Strict reading (“after” meaning strictly later): The dataset shows no such matches; the claim that the surface “be clay” after that date is not supported by any data here.
- If “after” was intended to include that date (“on or after”), then the only match on that date was indeed on clay.

Assumptions made:
- The table public.ji_nov_k represents a single player’s match log (judging by the opponent column and entries; likely Jiří Novák), and “opponent” refers to the opposing player’s name (stored in lowercase in examples).
- “After July 13, 2003” is interpreted strictly as later than 2003-07-13; I also checked “on or after” as a common alternate intent.
- The date parsing with TO_DATE('FMMonth DD , YYYY') correctly converts all relevant rows for filtering.
