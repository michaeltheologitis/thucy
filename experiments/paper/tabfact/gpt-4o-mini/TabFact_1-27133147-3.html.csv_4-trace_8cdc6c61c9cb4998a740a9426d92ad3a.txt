  - Columns: team (text), outgoing head coach (text), manner of departure (text), date of vacancy (text), position in table (text), incoming head coach (text), date of appointment (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Confirm the exact team naming present in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga;
Result (excerpt):
- Sporting
- Naval 1 de Maio
- Vitória de Setúbal
- Marítimo
- Académica
- Portimonense
- Beira - Mar
- União de Leiria

2) Retrieve the appointment information for União de Leiria
SQL:
SELECT team, "incoming head coach", "date of appointment" FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga WHERE team ILIKE '%Leiria%';
Result:
- Team: União de Leiria
- Incoming Head Coach: Pedro Caixinha
- Date of Appointment: 10 July 2010

3) Parse the date and test whether it is strictly before 2010-07-10
SQL:
SELECT team,
       TO_DATE("date of appointment", 'DD Month YYYY') AS parsed_appointment_date,
       TO_DATE("date of appointment", 'DD Month YYYY') < '2010-07-10' AS is_before_2010_07_10
FROM public.t_2010_11_primeira_liga
WHERE team ILIKE '%Leiria%';
Result:
- Team: União de Leiria
- Parsed Appointment Date: 2010-07-10
- is_before_2010_07_10: false

Conclusion
- The recorded date of appointment for União de Leiria is 10 July 2010. This is not before 10 July 2010; it is exactly on that date. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Before” is interpreted as a strict inequality (exclusive). If interpreted as “on or before,” the statement would be true.
- Team matching used a case-insensitive LIKE ('%Leiria%') to account for diacritics/spacing in names.
- Dates are stored as text and parsed using the 'DD Month YYYY' format in SQL.
