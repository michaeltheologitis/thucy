Claim: “Greg Ostertag played center and went to Kansas.”

Data sources explored:
- Connected database: PostgreSQL, public schema.
- Relevant table identified: public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster (columns: player, nationality, position, years for jazz, school / club team).

Evidence gathered from the data:
1) Player record lookup by last name
- Result: Found player Greg Ostertag with position Center and school Kansas.
- SQL executed: SELECT player, position, "school / club team" FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE player ILIKE '%Ostertag%';
- Returned data:
  - Player: Greg Ostertag
  - Position: Center
  - School / Club Team: Kansas

Assessment:
- The database explicitly lists Greg Ostertag’s position as Center and his school as Kansas. This directly supports both parts of the claim.

Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “go to Kansas” is interpreted as having attended/played college basketball at the University of Kansas, as represented in the “school / club team” field as “Kansas.”
