Claim interpreted: More than 100 games have been played in the series associated with the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy.

What I checked:
- Located the rivalry entry that lists the Sawhorse Dollar (Trophy) and retrieved its “games played”.

Evidence from the database:
1) Query to directly locate the rivalry by its trophy name and return the key fields
Executed SQL:
SELECT teams, name, trophy, "first met", "games played", "series record" FROM my_info_table WHERE trophy ILIKE 'Sawhorse Dollar' OR trophy ILIKE 'Sawhorse Dollar Trophy';
Result:
- Teams: Dartmouth - Princeton
- Name: None
- Trophy: Sawhorse Dollar
- First Met: 1897
- Games Played: 90 games
- Series Record: 43 - 43 - 4

2) General listing used during exploration (not required for the conclusion but included for completeness)
Executed SQL:
SELECT teams, trophy, "games played" FROM my_info_table;
Relevant row observed: Dartmouth - Princeton | Sawhorse Dollar | 90 games

Assessment:
- The database reports “Games Played: 90 games” for the Sawhorse Dollar rivalry (Dartmouth–Princeton). 90 is not more than 100. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim that more than 100 games have been played in this series is false per the available data.

Assumptions:
- “Series with the Sawhorse Dollar Trophy” refers to the Dartmouth–Princeton rivalry entry identified in the database.
- “More than 100 game be play” is interpreted as “More than 100 games have been played.”
