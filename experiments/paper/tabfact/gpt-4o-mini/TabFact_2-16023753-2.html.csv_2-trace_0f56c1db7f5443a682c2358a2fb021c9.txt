Claim interpreted: “9 of the Dolphins’ final 10 games were victories.”

Data source inspected: PostgreSQL table t_1983_miami_dolphins_season (columns: week, date, opponent, result, attendance). Games are ordered by week; results begin with ‘W’ for wins and ‘L’ for losses.

Evidence and findings:
- I retrieved all 1983 Miami Dolphins games ordered by week to understand the season flow and result encoding.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result, attendance FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season ORDER BY week;

- I then retrieved the final 10 games (highest weeks) and counted wins/losses based on the result prefix.
  Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date, opponent, result
  FROM t_1983_miami_dolphins_season
  ORDER BY week DESC
  LIMIT 10;

  Returned rows (final 10 games):
  - Week 16: New York Jets — Result: W 34 - 14
  - Week 15: Atlanta Falcons — Result: W 31 - 24
  - Week 14: Houston Oilers — Result: W 24 - 17
  - Week 13: Cincinnati Bengals — Result: W 38 - 14
  - Week 12: Baltimore Colts — Result: W 37 - 0
  - Week 11: New England Patriots — Result: L 17 - 6
  - Week 10: San Francisco 49ers — Result: W 20 - 17
  - Week 9: Los Angeles Rams — Result: W 30 - 14
  - Week 8: Baltimore Colts — Result: W 21 - 7
  - Week 7: New York Jets — Result: W 32 - 14

Count from these final 10 games: 9 wins (results starting with ‘W’), 1 loss (result starting with ‘L’).

Conclusion: The data shows the Dolphins won 9 of their final 10 games in the 1983 season.

Assumptions made:
- “Dolphin” refers to the Miami Dolphins (NFL).
- “Final 10 games” refers to the last 10 regular-season games of the 1983 season, ordered by the week field.
