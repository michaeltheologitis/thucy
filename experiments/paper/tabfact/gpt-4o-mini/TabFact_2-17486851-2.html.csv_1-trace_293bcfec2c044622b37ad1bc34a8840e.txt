Claim to verify: “for the nat por, it be a mutual consent loan return, and the transfer fee be free.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season (APOEL F.C. 2008–09 season).
- Schema (from introspection): columns = nat (text), name (text), moving to (text), type (text), transfer window (text), transfer fee (text), source (text). No relationships.

Evidence
1) Targeted lookup of Portuguese nationality entries (case-insensitive)
- Result: 1 matching row
  - nat: por
  - name: Paulo Costa
  - moving to: Anorthosis Famagusta
  - type: Mutual Consent Loan Return
  - transfer fee: Free
  - transfer window: Winter
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer fee", "transfer window"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  WHERE LOWER(nat) = 'por';

2) Context sample from the table (includes the Portuguese row above among sample rows)
- Sample shows the same row: por | Paulo Costa | Anorthosis Famagusta | mutual consent loan return | free
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT nat, name, "moving to", type, "transfer fee"
  FROM public.t_2008_09_apoel_f_c_season
  LIMIT 20;

Assessment
- The table contains a row where nat = por and the transfer type is “Mutual Consent Loan Return” with transfer fee “Free.”
- This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “nat por” is interpreted as the nationality code ‘por’ (Portuguese) in the nat column.
- “mutual consent loan return” and “transfer fee free” correspond exactly to the type and transfer fee text fields in the table, irrespective of letter casing.
