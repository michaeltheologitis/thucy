Claim interpreted: The statement appears to assert that, for the US Open, the result was 1R (first round) in 1986 and 3R (third round) in 1999.

Data source discovery
- Available database contains a single table: katrina_adams, which records tournament results by year.

Schema (summary)
- Table: katrina_adams
  - Columns: tournament (text), and year columns including "1986", "1999" (text values such as 1r, 3r, a, etc.)

Evidence
1) Retrieve all tournaments with 1986 and 1999 values
SQL executed:
SELECT tournament, "1986", "1999" FROM katrina_adams;
Result (relevant row extracted):
- tournament: us open | 1986: 1r | 1999: 1r

2) Directly fetch the US Open row (case-insensitive) to confirm
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM katrina_adams WHERE tournament ILIKE 'us open';
Result (relevant fields):
- 1986: 1r
- 1999: 1r

Assessment
- The data shows the US Open result is 1R in 1986 (matches the claim).
- The 1999 result is 1R, not 3R (contradicts the claim).

Conclusion
- The claim is partly wrong: correct for 1986, incorrect for 1999 according to the data.

Assumptions
- The katrina_adams table represents Katrina Adams’s Grand Slam results by year, with values like 1r/3r indicating the round reached in singles (or overall tournament result). The phrase “the us open have 1r in 1986 but have 3r in 1999” is interpreted as referring to Katrina Adams’s US Open results in those years.
