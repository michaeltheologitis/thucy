Claim to verify: “the april 26 2004 tournament take place in surbiton , great britain.”

Data sources explored:
- PostgreSQL database (schema: public), table: alex_bogdanovic (columns: date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, score). This table lists Alex Bogdanovic’s tournament finals with dates and tournament locations.

Evidence gathered:
1) All rows overview (shows the context and exact dates/locations recorded):
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament, surface, "opponent in the final", score FROM alex_bogdanovic;
Result excerpt relevant to this claim:
- 2 June 2003 — Surbiton, Great Britain — Grass — Opponent: Wesley Moodie — Score: 4 - 6, 7 - 6 (2), 1 - 6
- 26 April 2004 — Glasgow, Great Britain F1 — Carpet — Opponent: Gaël Monfils — Score: 4 - 6, 3 - 6
- 5 July 2004 — Nottingham, Great Britain — Grass — Opponent: Jo-Wilfried Tsonga — Score: 3 - 6, 4 - 6

2) Filter entries specifically in 2004 (to confirm the April 26, 2004 tournament location):
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament FROM public.alex_bogdanovic WHERE date LIKE '%2004%';
Results:
- 26 April 2004 — Glasgow, Great Britain F1
- 5 July 2004 — Nottingham, Great Britain

3) Search for any Surbiton entries (to see if Surbiton appears and when):
SQL executed:
SELECT date, tournament FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE tournament ILIKE '%Surbiton%';
Result:
- 2 June 2003 — Surbiton, Great Britain

Analysis:
- The database records for Alex Bogdanovic show that on 26 April 2004, the tournament listed is “Glasgow, Great Britain F1,” not Surbiton.
- Surbiton appears in the data only for 2 June 2003, not on any date in 2004.
- Therefore, the statement that the April 26, 2004 tournament took place in Surbiton, Great Britain is contradicted by the data. The correct location in this dataset is Glasgow, Great Britain (F1 event).

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the tournament date/location as captured in the alex_bogdanovic table (finals data). No broader tournament database was available; conclusions are based on this authoritative dataset.
