Claim: “the perth wildcat and townsville crocodile both have the same won record for the season.”

Conclusion: Verified (for the available 2008–09 NBL season data).

What I checked and why:
- I located a standings table for the 2008–09 NBL season (public.t_2008_09_nbl_season). To determine if both teams had the same “won record,” I compared the total wins for Perth Wildcats and Townsville Crocodiles by parsing their home and away win totals.

Key evidence from data:
- Both teams appear in the dataset.
- Perth Wildcats: Home 11-4, Away 6-9 → Total wins = 11 + 6 = 17; Losses = 13; % Won = 56.67.
- Townsville Crocodiles: Home 12-3, Away 5-10 → Total wins = 12 + 5 = 17; Losses = 13; % Won = 56.67.
- Therefore, both teams have identical win totals (17) and overall records (17–13) in this season’s data.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) List teams present to confirm team names exist
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season;
Result (excerpt): Wollongong Hawks; Townsville Crocodiles; Sydney Spirit; New Zealand Breakers; Melbourne Tigers; Adelaide 36ers; South Dragons; Gold Coast Blaze; Cairns Taipans; Perth Wildcats.

2) Retrieve the two teams’ records
SQL:
SELECT team, home, away, lost, "% won"
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE lower(team) IN ('perth wildcats', 'townsville crocodiles');
Result:
- Perth Wildcats: home = 11 - 4; away = 6 - 9; lost = 13; % won = 56.67
- Townsville Crocodiles: home = 12 - 3; away = 5 - 10; lost = 13; % won = 56.67

3) Full table retrieval used to validate context
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season;
Result (excerpt for relevant teams):
- perth wildcats | lost = 13 | home = 11 - 4 | away = 6 - 9 | % won = 56.67
- townsville crocodiles | lost = 13 | home = 12 - 3 | away = 5 - 10 | % won = 56.67

Assumptions made:
- “the season” refers to the season represented by the available dataset (2008–09 NBL).
- “won record” means total number of wins (i.e., sum of home wins and away wins).
