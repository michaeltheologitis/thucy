Conclusion: In the 2008–09 NBL season data available, the New Zealand Breakers did not win 2 more games than the Melbourne Tigers; in fact, the Melbourne Tigers won 2 more games than the New Zealand Breakers (Tigers 20 wins, Breakers 18 wins).

Findings from the data:
- New Zealand Breakers: home 10–5 and away 8–7 → total wins = 18.
- Melbourne Tigers: home 11–4 and away 9–6 → total wins = 20.
- Difference (Breakers – Tigers) = 18 – 20 = −2 → Tigers have 2 more wins.

Evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Table schema inspection
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_name = 't_2008_09_nbl_season';
Result (abridged): columns include team (text), home (text), away (text), lost (bigint), last 5 (text), streak (text), % pts (double precision), % won (double precision).

2) Sample rows (to view team entries and home/away formats)
SQL:
SELECT *
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
LIMIT 10;
Result excerpt shows:
- melbourne tigers — home: 11 - 4; away: 9 - 6; lost: 10; % won: 66.67
- new zealand breakers — home: 10 - 5; away: 8 - 7; lost: 12; % won: 60.00

3) Compute home and away wins for the two teams
SQL:
SELECT team,
       split_part(home, ' - ', 1)::int AS home_wins,
       split_part(away, ' - ', 1)::int AS away_wins
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE team = 'new zealand breakers' OR team = 'melbourne tigers';
Results:
- melbourne tigers: home_wins = 11, away_wins = 9
- new zealand breakers: home_wins = 10, away_wins = 8

4) Compute total wins for each team
SQL:
SELECT team,
       split_part(home, ' - ', 1)::int + split_part(away, ' - ', 1)::int AS total_wins
FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season
WHERE team = 'new zealand breakers' OR team = 'melbourne tigers';
Results:
- melbourne tigers: total_wins = 20
- new zealand breakers: total_wins = 18

5) Compute the difference (Breakers minus Tigers)
SQL:
SELECT (SELECT SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING(home FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTRING(away FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER))
        FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE LOWER(team) = 'new zealand breakers')
     - (SELECT SUM(CAST(SUBSTRING(home FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) + CAST(SUBSTRING(away FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER))
        FROM public.t_2008_09_nbl_season WHERE LOWER(team) = 'melbourne tigers') AS breakers_minus_tigers;
Result: -2

Assessment of the claim:
- The magnitude of the difference is 2 games, but the direction is reversed. The Tigers, not the Breakers, have 2 more wins.

Assumptions:
- The claim was interpreted in the context of the available dataset for the 2008–09 NBL season (table public.t_2008_09_nbl_season), since no season was specified.
- Team names matched the dataset’s lowercase formatting (e.g., 'new zealand breakers', 'melbourne tigers').
