Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Available table: public.the_suite_life_on_deck

Step 1: Inspect table structure
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'the_suite_life_on_deck';
Result (columns): year, award, category, recipient, result

Step 2: Quick sample to confirm content includes Kids' Choice Awards and Cole Sprouse
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.the_suite_life_on_deck LIMIT 5;
Observed relevant sample rows (paraphrased from results):
- Year: 2010 | Award: 2010 kids' choice awards | Category: favorite tv actor | Recipient: cole sprouse | Result: nominated
- Year: 2010 | Award: 2010 kids' choice awards | Category: favorite tv actor | Recipient: dylan sprouse | Result: won

Step 3: Targeted verification for 2010 and 2011 nominations of Cole Sprouse in Favorite TV Actor at Kids' Choice Awards

SELECT year, award, category, recipient, result FROM public.the_suite_life_on_deck WHERE LOWER(award) LIKE '%kids'' choice%' AND LOWER(category) LIKE '%favorite tv actor%' AND LOWER(recipient) LIKE '%cole sprouse%' AND year IN (2010, 2011) ORDER BY year;
Results:
- 2010 | 2010 kids' choice awards | favorite tv actor | cole sprouse | nominated
- 2011 | 2011 kids' choice awards | favorite tv actor | cole sprouse | nominated

Conclusion
- The data shows Cole Sprouse was nominated in both 2010 and 2011 for Favorite TV Actor at the Kids' Choice Awards. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “kids' choice award” refers to the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards represented in the award field values like “2010 kids' choice awards” and “2011 kids' choice awards.”
- Case-insensitive matching is appropriate for text fields (award, category, recipient).
