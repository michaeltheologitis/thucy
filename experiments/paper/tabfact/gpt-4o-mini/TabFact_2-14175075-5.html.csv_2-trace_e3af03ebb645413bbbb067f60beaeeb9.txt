Summary of approach
- I explored the available data sources and identified a table capturing Cy-Hawk series events with sport and date fields. I then parsed the date values to find the latest event date and checked which sport(s) occurred on that date.

Data source discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series (columns: date TEXT, site TEXT, sport TEXT, "winning team" TEXT, series TEXT)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Previewed sample rows to inspect date formats
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series LIMIT 20;
Observation: The date field uses a textual format like "september 4 , 2007" with an extra space before and after the comma.

2) Found the maximum parsed date across the table
SQL:
SELECT MAX(TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY')) AS max_parsed_date FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series;
Result: 2008-04-01

3) Listed all rows on that maximum date to identify the sport(s)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series WHERE TO_DATE(date, 'Month DD, YYYY') = '2008-04-01';
Result row:
- Date: April 1, 2008
- Series: Iowa State 18 - 9
- Site: Ames
- Sport: Softball
- Winning Team: Iowa

Conclusion
- The latest event date in the dataset is 2008-04-01, and the sport on that date is Softball. Therefore, the claim that “softball [is] the sport with the latest date” is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “Latest date” refers to the maximum event date within the public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series table.
- “Sport” refers to the value in the sport column, treated case-insensitively.
- Date strings are correctly parsed by TO_DATE using the 'Month DD, YYYY' pattern (the evidence queries above successfully returned parsed results).
