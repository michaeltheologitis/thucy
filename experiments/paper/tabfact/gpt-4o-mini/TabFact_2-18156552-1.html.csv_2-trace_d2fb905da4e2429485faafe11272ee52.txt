Claim to verify: “NGC 2082 redshift faster than NGC 1705 by 551 km/s ± 6 km/s.”

Data discovery
- Source: A PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single accessible table: public.dorado_group
- Schema (as reported):
  - name (text)
  - type (text)
  - ra ( j2000 ) (text)
  - dec ( j2000 ) (text)
  - redshift (km / s) (text)
  - apparent magnitude (double precision)

Plan
1) Locate rows for NGC 2082 and NGC 1705 in dorado_group.
2) Extract their redshift (km/s) values.
3) Compute the velocity difference and compare with 551 ± 6 km/s.

Executed queries and tool evidence
1) Attempt to retrieve redshift values directly:
   SQL executed:
   SELECT name, "redshift (km / s)", type FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'NGC 2082';
   Result: Tool reported an error accessing the redshift column.

2) Attempt to retrieve redshift for NGC 1705:
   SQL executed:
   SELECT name, "redshift (km / s)", type FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name = 'NGC 1705';
   Result: Tool reported an error accessing the redshift column.

3) Broad attempt to read the redshift column:
   SQL executed:
   SELECT name, "redshift (km / s)", type FROM public.dorado_group;
   Result: Tool reported an error accessing the redshift column.

4) Fallback to retrieve basic entries (without redshift):
   SQL executed:
   SELECT name, type FROM public.dorado_group;
   Result: Reported as successful but did not return redshift values. No velocity data available from this query.

5) Attempt to fetch full rows for NGC 2082 and NGC 1705 to inspect available columns/values:
   SQL executed:
   SELECT * FROM public.dorado_group WHERE name IN ('NGC 2082', 'NGC 1705');
   Result: Tool reported no matching rows for these names, so no redshift values could be retrieved.

Findings
- Despite multiple queries, I could not obtain any redshift (km/s) values for NGC 2082 or NGC 1705 from the available database. One query reported the table read was possible for name and type, but specific rows for these targets were not retrievable, and direct access to the “redshift (km / s)” column repeatedly errored.
- Therefore, I do not have any authoritative velocity values from the provided data source to compute and verify whether NGC 2082’s redshift exceeds that of NGC 1705 by 551 ± 6 km/s.

Conclusion
- The claim cannot be substantiated with the accessible data. With no verifiable velocities for either object in the provided source, the asserted 551 ± 6 km/s difference is unsupported by the evidence available here.

Assumptions made (due to limited data access)
- The dorado_group table, if accessible fully, would contain heliocentric recession velocities in the “redshift (km / s)” field.
- Galaxy names in the table would match the canonical strings “NGC 2082” and “NGC 1705.”
- The absence of retrievable rows/values in this environment implies no evidence is available to verify the numerical claim.
