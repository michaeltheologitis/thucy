Claim interpreted: “David Moore directed 5 episodes of Series 2 of Merlin.”

Data source explored
- Database: merlin_series_2 (public schema)
- Table: merlin_series_2
  - Columns: no overall (bigint), no for series (bigint), title (text), directed by (text), written by (text), original air date (text), uk viewers (million) (double precision)

Evidence
1) Count of episodes where the director field equals David Moore (case-insensitive)
- Result: 3
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count
  FROM merlin_series_2
  WHERE LOWER("directed by") = LOWER('David Moore');

2) Episodes where the director field contains “David Moore” anywhere (case-insensitive substring match)
- Result (3 episodes):
  - No for Series: 1, Title: The Curse of Cornelius Sigan, Directed by: David Moore
  - No for Series: 4, Title: Lancelot and Guinevere, Directed by: David Moore
  - No for Series: 5, Title: Beauty and the Beast (Part 1), Directed by: David Moore
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "no for series", title, "directed by" FROM merlin_series_2 WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%David Moore%';

3) Total number of episodes listed in the Series 2 table (for context)
- Result: 12
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM merlin_series_2;

Conclusion
- The data shows David Moore directed 3 episodes in Series 2 of Merlin, not 5. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s statement as: “David Moore directed five episodes of Merlin Series 2.”
- Used a case-insensitive substring search to capture any co-director or multi-name entries in the “directed by” field. The results still show 3 episodes.
