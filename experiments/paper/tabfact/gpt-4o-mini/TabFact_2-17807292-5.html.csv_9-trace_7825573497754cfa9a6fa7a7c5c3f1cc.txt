Claim to verify: “camilo villegas from columbia and david tom from the united state tie for eighth place with + 4 to par.”

Summary of findings grounded in data:
- The available dataset contains the 2008 PGA Championship leaderboard (table: public.t_2008_pga_championship) with columns: place, player, country, score, and "to par".
- Both Camilo Villegas and David Toms appear in this table. Their entries show they were tied for 9th (t9), at + 3 to par—not tied for 8th, and not at +4 to par.
- The dataset contains no entries for 8th or T8 and no entries with + 4 to par.
- Nationalities in the data list Camilo Villegas as Colombia and David Toms as United States (spelled correctly in the data; the claim’s spellings are off).

Evidence with executed SQL and results:
1) Retrieve the two named players (using partial match to be robust to spacing/accents):
SQL: SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par" FROM t_2008_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Villegas%' OR player ILIKE '%Toms%';
Result excerpt:
- Player: David Toms | Country: United States | Place: t9 | Score: 72 + 69 + 72 = 213 | To Par: + 3
- Player: Camilo Villegas | Country: Colombia | Place: t9 | Score: 74 + 72 = 67 = 213 | To Par: + 3

2) Check whether an 8th-place or T8 position exists in the data:
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship ORDER BY place ASC;
Result: 1, t2, t4, t7, t9 (no '8' or 't8')

3) Verify the range of "to par" values present:
SQL: SELECT "to par", COUNT(*) AS cnt FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship GROUP BY "to par" ORDER BY "to par";
Result: "- 2" (1), "- 1" (2), "+ 1" (3), "+ 2" (2), "+ 3" (4) — no "+ 4"

4) Additional checks confirming absence (no rows returned):
- SQL: SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE place = 'T8';
  Result: no rows
- SQL: SELECT player, country, place, "to par" FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE "to par" = '+4';
  Result: no rows

Conclusion:
- The data shows Camilo Villegas (Colombia) and David Toms (United States) tied for 9th at +3 to par. There is no evidence they tied for 8th, and no evidence of +4 to par in this dataset. Therefore, the core claim (tie for eighth at +4) is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the tournament represented by the available dataset (2008 PGA Championship leaderboard as captured in the provided table, which appears to reflect standings after three rounds). All conclusions are limited to this dataset’s scope.
- Interpreted “camilo villegas” as Camilo Villegas and “david tom” as David Toms; “columbia” as Colombia and “united state” as United States.
