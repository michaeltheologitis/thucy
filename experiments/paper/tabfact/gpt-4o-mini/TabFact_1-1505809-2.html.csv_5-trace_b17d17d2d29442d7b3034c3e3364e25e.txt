Claim interpreted: “83% be the total of all shot pct occurrence when the value of blank end be 8.” I interpret this as asserting that the sum (i.e., total) of the shot percentages for all rows where the column “blank ends” equals 8 is 83%.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Relevant table: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier (2005 Tim Hortons Brier curling statistics)

Relevant schema (abridged):
- Columns include: locale (text), skip (text), w (bigint), l (bigint), pf (bigint), pa (bigint), "ends won" (bigint), "ends lost" (bigint), "blank ends" (bigint), "stolen ends" (bigint), "shot pct" (text)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Rows where "blank ends" = 8
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT skip, locale, "blank ends", "shot pct" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 8;
- Result rows (summarized):
  • skip: jean - michel mãnard | locale: quebec | blank ends: 8 | shot pct: 80%

2) Count, sum, and average of shot pct (numeric) for rows where "blank ends" = 8
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, SUM(CAST(REPLACE("shot pct", '%', '') AS numeric)) AS total_shot_pct, AVG(CAST(REPLACE("shot pct", '%', '') AS numeric)) AS average_shot_pct FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE "blank ends" = 8;
- Results:
  • row_count: 1
  • total_shot_pct: 80
  • average_shot_pct: 80

Findings:
- There is exactly one row where "blank ends" equals 8, and its shot percentage is 80%.
- Therefore, the total (sum) of all shot percentage values for rows with "blank ends" = 8 is 80%, not 83%.

Conclusion:
- The claim that the total of all shot pct occurrences equals 83% when blank ends = 8 is not supported by the data; the correct total is 80%.

Assumptions made:
- “blank end” in the claim refers to the column "blank ends" in the table.
- “total of all shot pct occurrence” means the sum of the shot percentage values (after removing the percent sign) across all rows satisfying the condition.
