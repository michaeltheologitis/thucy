Summary
- I examined the available U.S. House elections data source (1942) and queried for California’s 22nd congressional district. The data explicitly marks California 22 as a new seat that resulted in a Republican gain.

Evidence from the database
1) California’s 22nd district marked as a new seat and Republican gain
- Result returned by the query includes: “California 22 – Result: New seat, Republican gain.”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT district, result FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942;

2) Candidate-level detail for California 22 (1942)
- Returned details: John J. Phillips (Republican) defeated N.E. West (Democrat) with 57.6% of the vote; the entry notes it was a newly created district and a Republican gain.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE district LIKE '%California%22%';

Data source discovery and structure
- Available table: public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
- Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), first_elected (text), result (text), candidates (text)

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that California’s 22nd congressional district was a newly created seat in the 1942 House elections and that it resulted in a Republican gain. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions
- The user’s claim is interpreted in the context of the available dataset (1942 U.S. House elections). If the intent was a different cycle (e.g., a modern redistricting), that information is not available in the current data source; the verification is therefore tied to 1942.
