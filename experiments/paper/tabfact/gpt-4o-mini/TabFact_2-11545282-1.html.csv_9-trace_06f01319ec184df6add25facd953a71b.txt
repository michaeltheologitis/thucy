Claim to verify: “after 1985, the united state contribute 2 player with rafael araãjo be the most recent.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database, schema public
- Table: utah_jazz_all_time_roster (player TEXT, nationality TEXT, position TEXT, "years for jazz" TEXT, "school / club team" TEXT)

Evidence 1: Rafael Araãjo’s record
- Result (from database):
  - Player: Rafael Araãjo
  - Nationality: Brazil
  - Years for Jazz: 2006 - 2007
  - School/Club Team: BYU
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, nationality, "years for jazz", "school / club team" 
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE player ILIKE '%Rafael%';

Evidence 2: Nationalities containing “United” and associated players
- Result: Only nationality found containing “United” is "united states" with 6 players in the table. Listed players and their Jazz years: Rick Adelman (1974 - 75), Louis Amundson (2007), J.J. Anderson (1982 - 85), Shandon Anderson (1996 - 99), Isaac Austin (1991 - 93), Anthony Avent (1998 - 99)
- Executed SQL (distinct nationalities):
  SELECT DISTINCT nationality FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster WHERE LOWER(nationality) LIKE '%united%';
- Executed SQL (count and list):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count, STRING_AGG(player || ' (' || "years for jazz" || ')', ', ') AS players 
  FROM public.utah_jazz_all_time_roster 
  WHERE LOWER(nationality) LIKE '%united%' 
  GROUP BY nationality;

Evidence 3: How many United States players appeared for the Jazz after 1985, and who is most recent
- Result: 4 players from the United States have Jazz years after 1985. Parsed players (sorted by end_year desc):
  1) Louis Amundson — Start 2007, End 2007
  2) Shandon Anderson — Start 1996, End 1996
  3) Isaac Austin — Start 1991, End 1991
  4) Anthony Avent — Start 1998, End 1998
- Executed SQL (count):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE nationality ILIKE 'United States'
    AND (SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '^(\d{4})')::INTEGER >= 1986 
         OR SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '-(\d{4})$')::INTEGER >= 1986);
- Executed SQL (list):
  SELECT player,
         COALESCE(NULLIF(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '^(\d{4})'), ''), '0')::INTEGER AS start_year,
         COALESCE(NULLIF(SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '-(\d{4})$'), ''), '0')::INTEGER AS end_year
  FROM utah_jazz_all_time_roster
  WHERE nationality ILIKE 'United States'
    AND (SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '^(\d{4})')::INTEGER >= 1986 
         OR SUBSTRING("years for jazz" FROM '-(\d{4})$')::INTEGER >= 1986)
  ORDER BY end_year DESC
  LIMIT 20;

Assessment against the claim
- The claim states that after 1985, the United States contributed 2 players, with Rafael Araãjo as the most recent.
- According to the data:
  - Rafael Araãjo’s nationality is Brazil, not United States, and his Jazz tenure is 2006–2007.
  - The table shows 4 United States players with Jazz years after 1985 (not 2). The most recent of these is Louis Amundson (2007), not Rafael Araãjo.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the database.

Assumptions made
- “united state” is interpreted as the nationality “United States.”
- “contribute 2 player” is interpreted as “there were 2 players of that nationality on the Utah Jazz roster whose Jazz years include any year after 1985.”
- “most recent” is interpreted as the player whose latest Jazz year (end of the range) is the greatest.
