Data sources explored:

- Schema: public
- Table: la_cage_aux_folles_musical (columns: year, award, category, nominee, result)

Step 1: Check whether the dataset contains any Drama Desk Award entries for Jerry Mitchell and count them.
Executed SQL 1 (list rows):
SELECT * FROM public.la_cage_aux_folles_musical WHERE award ILIKE '%Drama Desk%' AND nominee ILIKE '%Jerry Mitchell%';

Result 2: 1

Step 2: Review all Drama Desk Award entries in the table to confirm coverage for this production.

- 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding choreography | jerry mitchell | won
- 2005 | drama desk award | outstanding costume design | william ivey long | nominated

Findings:
- Within the available dataset (which covers awards related to the musical La Cage aux Folles), Jerry Mitchell appears exactly once in connection with a Drama Desk Award (2005, Outstanding Choreography, result: won).
- The dataset does not show three Drama Desk Award nominations for Jerry Mitchell. It only evidences one such nomination/win for this specific production context.

Conclusion:
- Based strictly on the accessible data, the claim that Jerry Mitchell has been nominated for a Drama Desk Award three times is not supported. The evidence shows one such instance in this dataset.

Assumptions and scope notes:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to Jerry Mitchell’s overall career. The available data only covers awards entries tied to the musical La Cage aux Folles and is not a comprehensive database of all Drama Desk nominations across all productions or years. Therefore, the conclusion reflects what can be verified within this dataset only.
