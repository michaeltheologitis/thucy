Claim interpreted: “The United States team won 8 Solheim Cups; the event started in 1990; the United States’ last win in that span was in 2009.”

Data discovery
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.solheim_cup (columns: year, venue, "winning team", score, "usa captain", "europe captain").

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Solheim Cup start year
- Finding: The earliest year recorded is 1990.
- SQL (minimum year): SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year FROM public.solheim_cup;
  Result: 1990
- SQL (maximum year): SELECT MAX(year) AS max_year FROM public.solheim_cup;
  Result: 2013

2) Distinct winning teams
- Finding: Only Europe and United States are present as winners.
- SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "winning team" FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY "winning team" ASC;
  Result: [Europe, United States]

3) Total wins by team
- Finding: United States has 8 wins; Europe has 5 wins (total 13 events from 1990–2013).
- SQL: SELECT "winning team", COUNT(*) AS wins FROM public.solheim_cup GROUP BY "winning team" ORDER BY wins DESC;
  Result: United States = 8; Europe = 5

4) Year-by-year winners (to confirm last U.S. win year)
- SQL: SELECT year, "winning team" FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY year ASC;
  Result (year – winner):
  1990 – United States
  1992 – Europe
  1994 – United States
  1996 – United States
  1998 – United States
  2000 – Europe
  2002 – United States
  2003 – Europe
  2005 – United States
  2007 – United States
  2009 – United States
  2011 – Europe
  2013 – Europe
  Observation: The United States’ most recent win in this dataset is 2009.

5) Most recent United States win (direct check)
- Finding: 2009.
- SQL: SELECT MAX(year) AS most_recent_us_win FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE "winning team" ILIKE '%United%States%';
  Result: 2009

6) Count of United States wins up to and including 2009
- Finding: 8 wins through 2009.
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE year <= 2009 AND "winning team" ILIKE '%United%States%';
  Result: 8

Conclusion
- The data shows the event began in 1990, the United States has 8 wins total, and their most recent win in the covered period is 2009. This fully supports the claim as stated.

Assumptions
- “last be in 2009” is interpreted as the most recent U.S. win within the dataset’s coverage (1990–2013).
