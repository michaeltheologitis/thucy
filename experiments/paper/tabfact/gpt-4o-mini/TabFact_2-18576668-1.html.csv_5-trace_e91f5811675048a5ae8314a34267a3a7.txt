Conclusion: No. According to the available event records, there were two events in 2003, not just the one on 25–26 January 2003.

Evidence from data:
1) List all records in 2003
- Result:
  • Season: 2002 - 03 | Event Type: Grand Prix | Location: Hiroshima | Format: Extended | Date: 25 - 26 January 2003 | Rank: 7
  • Season: 2002 - 03 | Event Type: Grand Prix | Location: Bangkok | Format: Standard | Date: 12 - 13 July 2003 | Rank: 1
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, "event type", location, format, date, rank 
FROM public.tsuyoshi_fujita 
WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';

2) Count of records in 2003
- Result: 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_records FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE date LIKE '%2003%';

Assessment: The dataset shows two events in 2003. Therefore, the statement that 25–26 January 2003 was the only game played in 2003 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions:
- "Game play" refers to an event entry in the tsuyoshi_fujita table.
- Verification is limited to the authoritative data available in the tsuyoshi_fujita table, where the date field is a text string containing the year.
