Summary of claim: “the highest point gap be on january 5, with a spread of 6 point.”

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with public schema containing table t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season (2003–04 Detroit Red Wings season games).

Schema overview (from schema inspection):
- Columns: date (text), visitor (text), score (text), home (text), decision (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Inspecting date and score formats
- Purpose: Verify presence and format of dates and the score string.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, score FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season LIMIT 15;
- Observed sample results include: “january 5 | 0 - 6”, indicating a game recorded on January 5 with score “0 - 6”.

2) Compute the maximum absolute goal differential across all games
- Purpose: Determine the highest “point gap” (interpreted as the absolute goal differential) in the dataset.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(ABS(SPLIT_PART(score, ' - ', 1)::int - SPLIT_PART(score, ' - ', 2)::int)) AS max_goal_differential
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season;
- Result: max_goal_differential = 6.

3) List all games that match this maximum differential
- Purpose: Identify which game(s) achieved the maximum differential and their dates.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score 
  FROM public.t_2003_04_detroit_red_wings_season 
  WHERE ABS((CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 1) AS INTEGER) - CAST(SPLIT_PART(score, '-', 2) AS INTEGER))) = 6;
- Result rows:
  - Date: January 5; Visitor: Nashville; Home: Detroit; Score: 0 - 6.

Conclusion:
- The highest point gap (maximum absolute goal differential) is 6, and it occurs on January 5. The data supports the claim fully.

Assumptions made:
- “Point gap” is interpreted as the absolute goal differential in the score field.
- The date field being text without a year is acceptable for matching “January 5.”
