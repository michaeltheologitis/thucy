Claim to verify: “8 different country receive the same number of bronze medal.”

Data source inspected: public.t_1988_winter_olympics (authoritative dataset available)

Interpretation: We interpret the claim as stating that, in the 1988 Winter Olympics medal table, there exists a bronze medal count value that is shared by exactly 8 different nations.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) How many nations are in the table?
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics;
Result: 11 nations

2) Distribution of bronze medal counts across nations
SQL:
SELECT bronze, COUNT(nation) AS nation_count 
FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics 
GROUP BY bronze 
ORDER BY nation_count DESC, bronze DESC;
Results:
- bronze = 2, nation_count = 6
- bronze = 3, nation_count = 2
- bronze = 9, nation_count = 1
- bronze = 6, nation_count = 1
- bronze = 5, nation_count = 1
Observation: The largest tie on bronze counts is 6 nations (all with 2 bronze medals). No bronze count is shared by 8 nations.

3) Direct check for any bronze count shared by exactly 8 nations
SQL:
SELECT bronze, COUNT(nation) AS nation_count 
FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics 
GROUP BY bronze 
HAVING COUNT(nation) = 8;
Result: 0 rows returned (no bronze count shared by exactly 8 nations)

4) Nations with the most common shared bronze count (for transparency)
SQL:
SELECT nation FROM public.t_1988_winter_olympics WHERE bronze = 2;
Result (6 nations): FIN, SWE, AUT, NED, FRG, ITA

Conclusion: The dataset shows no bronze medal count that is shared by 8 nations. The largest tie is 6 nations with 2 bronze medals. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions:
- The claim refers to the only available dataset (1988 Winter Olympics medal table) and to exact equality in bronze medal counts across different nations.
- The term “country” is mapped to the ‘nation’ field in the table (which uses IOC country codes).
