Claim to verify: “NGC 1574 has a deeper declination (°58′29″) than any other galaxy in the Dorado group.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered database: dorado_group (public schema)
- Table: dorado_group
  - Columns: name (text), type (text), ra ( j2000 ) (text), dec ( j2000 ) (text), redshift (km / s ) (text), apparent magnitude (double precision)

Key evidence from the data
1) All Dorado group objects with declinations (J2000), sorted by declination descending
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "dec ( j2000 )" FROM dorado_group ORDER BY "dec ( j2000 )" DESC;
- Result (name → Dec):
  - ngc 1574 → degree58′29″
  - ngc 1566 → degree56′16″
  - ngc 1688 → degree48′01″
  - ngc 1559 → degree47′01″
  - ngc 1553 → degree46′49″
  - ngc 1947 → degree45′36″
  - ngc 1543 → degree44′17″
  - ngc 1617 → degree36′08″
  - ngc 1549 → degree35′32″
  - ngc 1705 → degree21′40″
  - ngc 2082 → degree18′04″
  - ngc 1672 → degree14′50″
  - ic 2056 → degree12′25″
  - ngc 1796 → degree08′24″
  - ngc 1533 → degree07′06″
  - ngc 1515 → degree06′00″
  - ngc 1546 → degree03′39″
  - ngc 1596 → degree01′40″

2) Object with the maximum Dec (J2000) value in the dataset
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "name", "dec ( j2000 )"
  FROM dorado_group
  ORDER BY "dec ( j2000 )" DESC
  LIMIT 1;
- Result: ngc 1574 with dec = degree58′29″

Findings
- The value stored for NGC 1574’s declination is “degree58′29″”, which corresponds to the user’s “°58′29″”.
- When ordering the dataset’s declination values descending, ngc 1574 ranks first; no other listed Dorado group galaxy has a declination with a higher minute/second component than 58′29″ as represented in this dataset.

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset, NGC 1574’s declination entry (degree58′29″) is the most extreme among the listed Dorado group galaxies, supporting the claim that it is “deeper … than any other galaxy in the Dorado group.”

Assumptions and notes
- The dec (j2000) values are stored as text and appear without an explicit degree number preceding the degree symbol placeholder; we have treated the representation literally as provided. The comparison is based on the dataset’s ordering of these text declination values, which places NGC 1574 (degree58′29″) at the extreme end.
- “Deeper declination” is interpreted as the most extreme in absolute position as represented by the dataset’s declination strings. The dataset is taken as authoritative for Dorado group membership and coordinates.
