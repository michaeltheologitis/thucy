- 最終章序幕・別れ | saishūshōjomakuwakare | june 14 , 2010 | 13.4%

2) Get the rating of “arienai kisu”
SQL Query:
SELECT "episode title", "ratings", "broadcast date" 
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito 
WHERE LOWER("romanized title") = LOWER('arienai kisu');
Result: Episode Title = ありえないキス; Broadcast Date = May 17, 2010; Rating = 19.2%

3) Identify the earliest broadcast episode and its numeric rating (properly parsing dates)
SQL Query:
SELECT "episode title", "romanized title", "broadcast date", REPLACE("ratings", '%','')::numeric AS numeric_rating 
FROM public.tsuki_no_koibito 
ORDER BY to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\s+,', ',', 'g')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') ASC 
LIMIT 1;
Result: Episode Title = おまえが欲しい; Broadcast Date = 2010-05-10; Numeric Rating = 22.4

4) Compute the differences in a single, reproducible query
SQL Query:
WITH earliest_episode AS (
    SELECT 
        "episode title" AS title, 
        to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("broadcast date", '\s+,', ',', 'g')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS broadcast_date, 
        REPLACE(ratings, '%', '')::numeric AS rating
    FROM tsuki_no_koibito
    ORDER BY broadcast_date
    LIMIT 1
), arienai_kisu AS (
    SELECT REPLACE(ratings, '%', '')::numeric AS rating
    FROM tsuki_no_koibito
    WHERE "romanized title" = 'arienai kisu'
)
SELECT 
    ak.rating AS arienai_kisu_rating, 
    e.title AS earliest_episode_title, 
    e.broadcast_date AS earliest_broadcast_date, 
    e.rating AS earliest_rating, 
    (ak.rating - e.rating) AS point_difference, 
    ((ak.rating - e.rating) / e.rating) * 100 AS relative_percent_difference
FROM earliest_episode e, arienai_kisu ak;
Results:
- arienai_kisu_rating = 19.2
- earliest_episode_title = おまえが欲しい
- earliest_broadcast_date = 2010-05-10
- earliest_rating = 22.4
- point_difference = -3.2
- relative_percent_difference ≈ -14.29%

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported. “arienai kisu” does not have 5.8% more rating than the earliest-broadcast episode; it has 3.2 percentage points less (≈14.29% lower relatively).

Assumptions
- “Rating” refers to the numeric value in the ratings column (percent), comparing by percentage points unless otherwise specified.
- “Title with the earliest broadcast date” means the episode with the minimum parsed date in the broadcast date column.
- Case-insensitive matching is used for the romanized title “arienai kisu.”
