Claim to verify:
- "the september 1 game against the mets result in a win 3 - 0. there be 19196 crowd attendance"

Data source discovery:
- Available authoritative source: public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season (Toronto Blue Jays 1997 season game log)
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence gathered:
1) Query: list all 1997 Blue Jays games vs the Mets
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, attendance FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%mets%' ORDER BY date;

Result (relevant excerpts):
- Date: September 1, 1997 | Opponent: Mets | Score: 3 - 0 | Attendance: 19,196
- Date: September 2, 1997 | Opponent: Mets | Score: 8 - 5 | Attendance: 17,635
- Date: September 3, 1997 | Opponent: Mets | Score: 4 - 2 | Attendance: 14,513

2) Query: include fields indicating outcome context
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponent, score, loss, attendance, record FROM public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%mets%' ORDER BY date;

Result (relevant excerpt for Sep 1):
- Date: September 1 | Opponent: Mets | Score: 3 - 0 | Loss: Hentgen (14 - 9) | Attendance: 19,196 | Record: 65 - 71

Assessment:
- Attendance: The September 1 game vs the Mets shows attendance of 19,196. This matches the claim.
- Outcome and score: While the score field reads "3 - 0", the accompanying fields indicate this was a loss for the Blue Jays:
  - The "loss" column lists a Blue Jays pitcher (Hentgen), which aligns with a Blue Jays loss.
  - The team record moves from 65–71 after the game, consistent with taking a loss (record worsens on subsequent dates shown in the Mets series).
  - Therefore, the score is recorded as opponent runs first, then Blue Jays runs. On September 1, the Mets beat the Blue Jays 3–0. It was not a Blue Jays 3–0 win.

Conclusion:
- The attendance portion (19,196) is supported by the data.
- The result portion (“a win 3–0”) is contradicted by the data; the game was a 0–3 loss for the Blue Jays.

Assumptions made:
- The claim refers to the Toronto Blue Jays’ 1997 season game against the New York Mets on September 1, 1997, as represented in the table public.t_1997_toronto_blue_jays_season.
- The “score” column is ordered as opponent runs – Blue Jays runs (supported by the loss pitcher and record columns).
