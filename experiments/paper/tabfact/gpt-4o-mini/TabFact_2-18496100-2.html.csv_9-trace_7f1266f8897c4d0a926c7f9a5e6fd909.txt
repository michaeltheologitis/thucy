Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and schema.
- Queried the authoritative table to retrieve constituency names and numbers, then compared Datia and Gohad.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency (covers assembly segments under the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency).

Schema (as reported)
- Columns:
  - "constituency number" (text)
  - "name" (text)
  - "reserved for ( sc / st / none)" (text)
  - "district" (text)
  - "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve all rows (used to extract Datia and Gohad entries)
SQL executed:
SELECT "name", "constituency number", "district", "reserved for ( sc / st / none)", "number of electorates (2009)" 
FROM bhind_lok_sabha_constituency;

Relevant returned rows from this query:
- Name: Gohad | Constituency Number: 13 | District: Bhind | Reserved: SC | Electorates (2009): 166893
- Name: Datia | Constituency Number: 22 | District: Datia | Reserved: None | Electorates (2009): 143593

Assessment against the claim
- Claim: "datia's constituency number be lower than gohad's by 10" (interpreted as Datia = Gohad − 10).
- From the data: Datia = 22, Gohad = 13.
- Comparison: 22 is not lower than 13; rather, Datia is higher by 9.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion
- The data shows Datia’s constituency number (22) is not lower than Gohad’s (13), and the difference is not 10 in the stated direction.

Assumptions
- Interpreted "constituency number" as the numeric identifier listed in the table’s "constituency number" column.
- Interpreted the claim as referring to these assembly segment numbers within the Bhind Lok Sabha constituency data.
