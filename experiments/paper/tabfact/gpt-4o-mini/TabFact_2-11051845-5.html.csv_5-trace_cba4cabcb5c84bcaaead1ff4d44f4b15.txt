Claim interpreted: “Irregular galaxy has 2.1 more apparent magnitude than globular galaxy.” I interpret this as: in the available dataset, the typical (average) apparent magnitude of Irregular Galaxy objects is greater by 2.1 than that of Globular Galaxy (interpreted as Globular Cluster) objects.

Data source discovery and schema
- Available data source: PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000.
- Relevant fields: object type (text), apparent magnitude (double precision).

Evidence 1: Object types present
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "object type" FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 ORDER BY "object type" ASC;
Result (alphabetical):
- Globular Cluster
- Irregular Galaxy
- Spiral Galaxy

Evidence 2: Apparent magnitude statistics by object type
SQL executed:
SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS cnt, AVG("apparent magnitude") AS avg_mag, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_mag, MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_mag
FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
GROUP BY "object type"
ORDER BY "object type";
Results:
- Globular Cluster: count = 1, avg_mag = 10.5, min = 10.5, max = 10.5
- Irregular Galaxy: count = 2, avg_mag = 14.25, min = 14.0, max = 14.5
- Spiral Galaxy: count = 2, avg_mag = 10.3, min = 8.7, max = 11.9

Assessment
- In this dataset, Irregular Galaxy objects have an average apparent magnitude of 14.25 and Globular Cluster objects have an average of 10.5.
- Difference (Irregular − Globular) = 14.25 − 10.5 = 3.75.
- This is not equal to the claimed 2.1 more; the direction (irregular galaxies having a larger magnitude value than globular clusters) is consistent, but the magnitude of the difference is materially larger (3.75, not 2.1).
- Note: The dataset’s relevant object type is “Globular Cluster,” not “Globular Galaxy.”

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data. Irregular galaxies do have a higher (numerically larger) average apparent magnitude than globular clusters, but by about 3.75, not 2.1.

Assumptions made
- “More apparent magnitude” is interpreted as a numerically larger magnitude value.
- “Globular galaxy” is interpreted as “Globular Cluster,” which is the available object type in the dataset.
- “Have 2.1 more” refers to the difference in averages within the provided NGC 5001–6000 subset (the only accessible dataset).
