SELECT title, season, series, "directed by", "original air date"

Result:
- title: the 10 li'l grifters job
- season: 2
- series: 46
- directed by: arvin brown
- original air date: July 3, 2011

2) Cross-check by air date

WHERE series BETWEEN 44 AND 48;
Results (excerpt):
- Series 45: The Long Way Down Job — Directed by Dean Devlin — Original Air Date: June 26, 2011
- Series 46: The 10 Li'l Grifters Job — Directed by Arvin Brown — Original Air Date: July 3, 2011
- Series 47: The 15 Minutes Job — Directed by Marc Roskin — Original Air Date: July 10, 2011
- Series 48: The Van Gogh Job — Directed by John Rogers — Original Air Date: July 17, 2011

Assessment
- Original air date: Supported by the data — July 3, 2011 is correct for “The 10 Li'l Grifters Job”.
- Director: Not supported — the dataset lists Arvin Brown as the director, not Marc Roskin. Marc Roskin directed the following week’s episode (“The 15 Minutes Job”), not “The 10 Li'l Grifters Job”.

Conclusion
- The claim contains one correct element (air date) and one incorrect element (director). Therefore, the claim is partly inaccurate.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the user’s message as a verification request for the Leverage episode titled “The 10 Li'l Grifters Job,” focusing on director and original air date.
- Treated the table list_of_leverage_episodes as authoritative for episode metadata; parsed the text-form air date as a date for exact matching.
- Did not rely on the “season” field semantics (as it appears to represent intra-season numbering rather than the production season number) since it is not essential to the claim.
