Claim interpreted: “Bob Sand wrote episode 149.”

Data source discovery
- Available authoritative source: a PostgreSQL database with a table public.full_house_season_7, which appears to contain Full House Season 7 episode metadata.

Schema confirmation (to verify relevant fields exist)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'full_house_season_7';
- Result summary: The table has columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text).

Evidence query (identify episode 149 and its writer)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT "no in series", "no in season", title, "written by", "directed by" 
FROM full_house_season_7 
WHERE "no in series" = 149;
- Result:
  - No in Series: 149
  - No in Season: 5
  - Title: Fast Friends
  - Written By: Bob Sand
  - Directed By: John Tracy

Conclusion
- The database shows that Full House episode number 149 (global series count) is titled “Fast Friends” and is written by Bob Sand. This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions made
- “episode 149” refers to the global episode numbering column "no in series" within the available Full House Season 7 dataset.
- The claim pertains to the show represented by the available dataset (Full House), as no other datasets were accessible.
