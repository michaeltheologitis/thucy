Claim to verify: “sergio garcía, pádraig harrington and charlie wi tie for 4th place with + 1 to par.”

Data source explored
- Database: PostgreSQL (authoritative in this environment)
- Table: public.t_2008_pga_championship
- Columns (from information_schema): place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Table structure confirmation
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_pga_championship';
Result:
- place: text
- player: text
- country: text
- score: text
- to par: text

2) All players who finished tied for 4th (place t4)
SQL:
SELECT player, place, "to par", score FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE place ILIKE 't4';
Results:
- Sergio García | t4 | + 1 | 69 + 73 + 69 = 211
- Pádraig Harrington | t4 | + 1 | 71 + 74 + 66 = 211
- Charlie Wi | t4 | + 1 | 70 + 70 + 71 = 211

3) Sanity check: count of T4 finishers and their to-par values
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt, array_agg(DISTINCT "to par") AS distinct_to_par FROM public.t_2008_pga_championship WHERE place ILIKE 't4';
Results:
- cnt = 3
- distinct_to_par = ['+ 1']

Assessment of each part of the claim
- “sergio garcía”: Present among T4 finishers (Sergio García) — Supported by Query 2.
