Claim to verify: “the collingwood v melbourne game have the largest crowd size.”

Scope and approach
- I explored the connected relational data sources and found one relevant table for the 1972 VFL season. I then inspected its schema to identify the attendance field and queried the data to determine which match had the largest crowd.

Data source discovery
- Result: The public schema contains one table: t_1972_vfl_season
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

Schema inspection
- Table: public.t_1972_vfl_season
- Columns (from information_schema): home team (text), home team score (text), away team (text), away team score (text), venue (text), crowd (bigint), date (text)
- Primary key: None found
- SQL executed (columns):
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_1972_vfl_season' AND table_schema = 'public';
- SQL executed (primary key):
  SELECT kcu.column_name 
  FROM information_schema.table_constraints AS tc 
  JOIN information_schema.key_column_usage AS kcu 
    ON kcu.constraint_name = tc.constraint_name 
   AND kcu.table_name = tc.table_name 
  WHERE tc.table_name = 't_1972_vfl_season' 
    AND tc.constraint_type = 'PRIMARY KEY';

Evidence: largest crowd in the dataset
1) Find the maximum recorded crowd:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT MAX(crowd) AS max_crowd FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season;
- Result: 30,883

2) Retrieve the match(es) with that maximum crowd:
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "home team", "away team", "venue", "date", "crowd" 
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season 
  WHERE crowd = 30883;
- Result:
  - Home team: Collingwood; Away team: Melbourne; Venue: VFL Park; Date: 15 July 1972; Crowd: 30,883

3) Cross-check: Top 5 by crowd (to confirm ranking)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "home team", "away team", "venue", "date", "crowd"
  FROM public.t_1972_vfl_season
  ORDER BY "crowd" DESC
  LIMIT 5;
- Result (top entries):
  1) Collingwood vs Melbourne — VFL Park — 15 July 1972 — 30,883
  2) Essendon vs Richmond — Windy Hill — 15 July 1972 — 22,251
  3) Footscray vs St Kilda — Western Oval — 15 July 1972 — 18,655
  4) Carlton vs South Melbourne — Princes Park — 15 July 1972 — 14,465
  5) Hawthorn vs Geelong — Glenferrie Oval — 15 July 1972 — 12,425

Conclusion
- Within the 1972 VFL season dataset, the Collingwood vs Melbourne match recorded the largest crowd (30,883) and thus had the highest attendance of all matches in this table.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the matches captured in the available dataset (1972 VFL season) and interprets “crowd size” as the ‘crowd’ column (attendance).
