Evidence collected
1) List all matches on 3 June 1961 (to see venues used)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, venue, "home team", "away team" FROM t_1961_vfl_season WHERE date ILIKE '%3%June%1961%';

Result: 6 distinct venues

3) List the distinct venue names to confirm presence of Kardinia Park
Executed SQL:

Assessment
- Kardinia Park was indeed used on 3 June 1961 (Geelong vs Footscray).
- However, the total number of venues used that day was 6, not 4.

Conclusion
- The statement that “Kardinia Park [was] 1 of the 4 venue … on 3 June 1961” is incorrect on the number of venues, though it is correct that Kardinia Park was used on that date.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to VFL matches on 3 June 1961, using the authoritative 1961 VFL season dataset available. The date filter used a case-insensitive pattern match to accommodate the text-based date format in the table.
