Claim assessed: “Nick Faldo [is] the only player from Ireland.”

Data source explored: A PostgreSQL database with table public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf (2002 U.S. Open Golf Championship). The table includes columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), and "to par" (text).

Schema evidence
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2002_u_s_open_golf' AND table_schema = 'public';
- Result (abridged): place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)

Key evidence
1) Identify Nick Faldo and any Irish players
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%Faldo%' OR player ILIKE '%Harrington%';
- Result:
  - Nick Faldo — England
  - Pádraig Harrington — Ireland

2) List all players whose country indicates Ireland (including any variant with “Ireland” in the field)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_2002_u_s_open_golf WHERE LOWER(country) IN ('ireland','northern ireland') OR country ILIKE '%ireland%';
- Result:
  - Pádraig Harrington — Ireland

Findings
- Nick Faldo is recorded as being from England, not Ireland.
- There is at least one player from Ireland in this dataset (Pádraig Harrington).
- Therefore, the statement that Nick Faldo is the only player from Ireland is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate based on the available authoritative dataset.

Assumptions made
- “Player from Ireland” is interpreted using the country field in the 2002 U.S. Open dataset, treating “Ireland” and “Northern Ireland” as distinct values if present.
- The user’s claim is evaluated within the scope of this dataset (participants in the 2002 U.S. Open).
