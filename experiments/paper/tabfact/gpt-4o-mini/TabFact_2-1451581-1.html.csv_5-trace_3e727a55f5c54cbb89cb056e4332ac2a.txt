Claim to verify: “Cologne Bonn Airport saw a 0.1% increase in cargo.”

Data source exploration:
- Available database contains a table focused on airport cargo traffic: world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic.
- Relevant columns include: rank, total cargo (metric tonnes), airport, code (iata / icao), % change.

Evidence collected:
1) Targeted lookup for Cologne Bonn Airport by full name
- Result: One matching row with % change = 0.5%
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, "total cargo (metric tonnes)", airport, "code (iata / icao)", "% change" 
FROM world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic 
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Cologne Bonn Airport%'
- Returned row:
  - Rank: 28
  - Total Cargo (Metric Tonnes): 730,054
  - Airport: Cologne Bonn Airport
  - Code (IATA / ICAO): CGN / EDDK
  - % Change: 0.5%

2) Broad lookup by name fragments and code to ensure no alternate entries
- Result: Same single row; no entries showing 0.1%
- Executed SQL:
SELECT rank, "total cargo (metric tonnes)", airport, "code (iata / icao)", "% change" 
FROM world_s_busiest_airports_by_cargo_traffic 
WHERE airport ILIKE '%Cologne%' OR airport ILIKE '%Bonn%' OR "code (iata / icao)" = 'CGN';
- Returned row:
  - Rank: 28
  - Total Cargo (Metric Tonnes): 730,054
  - Airport: Cologne Bonn Airport
  - Code (IATA / ICAO): CGN / EDDK
  - % Change: 0.5%

Conclusion:
- The data shows a 0.5% increase for Cologne Bonn Airport, not 0.1%. While the direction (an increase) is correct, the stated magnitude is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions:
- The “% change” field represents the reported year-over-year change for the period covered by this dataset.
- “Cologne Bonn Airport” is uniquely identified by name and code (CGN / EDDK) in this table, and there are no separate duplicate rows for different periods within this dataset.
