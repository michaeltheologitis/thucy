Conclusion: Inaccurate. The data show that, among actual tournaments, The Open Championship is where Brian Watts has the highest number of events, not the second-highest. The second-highest is the PGA Championship.

Evidence from the database

1) Tournaments and events (as stored)
Executed SQL:
SELECT "tournament", "events" FROM public.brian_watts ORDER BY "events" DESC;

Returned rows:
- Totals | 17
- The Open Championship | 7
- PGA Championship | 6
- Masters Tournament | 2
- US Open | 2

2) Excluding the non-tournament summary row "Totals," find the tournament(s) with the second-highest number of events
Executed SQL:
WITH ranked AS (
  SELECT tournament, events, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY events DESC) AS rnk
  FROM public.brian_watts
  WHERE tournament <> 'Totals'
)
SELECT tournament, events FROM ranked WHERE rnk = 2;

Returned rows:
- PGA Championship | 6

Interpretation
- Excluding the summary row "Totals," the ranking by events is:
  - Rank 1: The Open Championship (7)
  - Rank 2: PGA Championship (6)
  - Rank 3: Masters Tournament (2), US Open (2)
- Therefore, The Open Championship is the highest, not the second-highest.

Assumptions
- "Tournament" refers to actual tournaments and excludes the summary row labeled "Totals."
- "Brian Watt" in the request refers to golfer Brian Watts, which matches the table name and contents.
