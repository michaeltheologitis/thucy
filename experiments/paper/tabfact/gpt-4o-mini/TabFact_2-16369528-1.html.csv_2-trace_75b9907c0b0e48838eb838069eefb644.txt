Claim to verify:
"After 2005, the winner(s) of the Lifetime Achievement Award are Andrew Rule & John Silvester, Sandra Harvey & Lindsay Simpson, Marele Day, Shane Maloney, and Peter Doyle."

What I checked:
- Queried the Ned Kelly Awards database for the Lifetime Achievement winners for years after 2005.
- Reviewed the full range of years available to ensure completeness.

Evidence from data:
- Available years in the table span 1996–2011. After 2005, the records are:
  - 2006: Andrew Rule and John Silvester
  - 2007: Sandra Harvey and Lindsay Simpson
  - 2008: Marele Day
  - 2009: Shane Maloney
  - 2010: Peter Doyle
  - 2011: N/A

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) Retrieve Lifetime Achievement winners after 2005:
SELECT year, "lifetime achievement" FROM ned_kelly_awards WHERE year > 2005;

2) Verify full span and context:
SELECT year, "lifetime achievement" FROM ned_kelly_awards ORDER BY year ASC;

3) Confirm table coverage (min/max year):
SELECT MIN(year) AS min_year, MAX(year) AS max_year FROM ned_kelly_awards;

Assessment:
- The list of winners the claim provides for years after 2005 (2006–2010) matches the database exactly.
- Note: 2011 shows no award (N/A), which the claim does not address; however, it does not contradict the claim as stated.

Conclusion:
- The names given in the claim correctly represent the Lifetime Achievement winners after 2005 in the available data (through 2011).

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “after 2005” as years strictly greater than 2005 (i.e., 2006 onward).
- “Lifetime Achievement Award” refers to the “lifetime achievement” column in the Ned Kelly Awards database.
