Claim assessed: “w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 62 - 70 result have the record of 27 - 9.”

What I checked
- I looked up the season in the VCU Rams men’s basketball dataset whose postseason results match the exact sequence provided: five wins (59-46, 74-56, 94-76, 72-71 OT, 71-61) followed by a loss (62-70).
- I then verified the overall season record (“record” field) for that season.

Evidence from data
1) Inspecting table format and a sample of seasons (shows 2011 row with the exact sequence and its record):
SQL:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt):
- 2011 | 28 - 12 | 11 | southwest | w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70

2) Directly matching the provided results sequence:
SQL:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results 
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball 
WHERE results = 'w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70';
Result:
- Year: 2011
- Record: 28 - 12
- Seed: 11
- Region: Southwest
- Results: w 59 - 46 w 74 - 56 w 94 - 76 w 72 - 71 ot w 71 - 61 l 62 - 70

Conclusion
- The listed results correspond to the 2011 season, and the season record in the data is 28 - 12, not 27 - 9. Therefore, the claim that these results “have the record of 27 - 9” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “result have the record of 27 - 9” refers to the overall season win-loss record associated with the exact postseason results sequence provided.
- The relevant domain is VCU Rams men’s basketball, as represented by the available dataset.
