Claim to verify:
"the 15th in the liga of the 2003 - 2004 season be in Estádio do Restelo while the 2nd in the liga be hold in Estádio Cidade de Coimbra"

Summary conclusion:
- The first part is supported by the data: the team that finished 15th in the 2003–2004 Primeira Liga is Belenenses, whose stadium is Estádio do Restelo.
- The second part is contradicted by the data: the team that finished 2nd in the 2003–2004 Primeira Liga is Benfica, whose stadium is Estádio da Luz, not Estádio Cidade de Coimbra. Estádio Cidade de Coimbra belongs to Académica de Coimbra, who finished 13th in the league that season.

Data discovery and schema grounding
1) List available tables
SQL executed:
SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE';
Key result excerpt:
- public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga

2) Inspect table columns
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_2004_05_primeira_liga';
Key result excerpt (column -> type):
- club -> text
- head coach -> text
- city -> text
- stadium -> text
- 2003 - 2004 season -> text

3) Inspect formatting of the season results
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga;
Key result excerpt shows entries like:
- 2nd in the liga
- 15th in the liga
- 13th in the liga
- (and others)

Evidence for each part of the claim
A) Who finished 15th in the liga (2003–2004), and what is their stadium?
SQL executed:
SELECT club, city, stadium 
FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga 
WHERE "2003 - 2004 season" IN ('15th in the liga', '2nd in the liga');
Results:
- 15th in the liga: Club = Belenenses; City = Lisbon; Stadium = Estádio do Restelo
- 2nd in the liga: Club = Benfica; City = Lisbon; Stadium = Estádio da Luz
Assessment of part A:
- Matches the claim: 15th place team (Belenenses) “be in Estádio do Restelo.” Supported.

B) Is the 2nd in the liga “held in Estádio Cidade de Coimbra”?
From the same query above, 2nd place is Benfica, whose stadium is Estádio da Luz (not Estádio Cidade de Coimbra).
To confirm who uses Estádio Cidade de Coimbra and their 2003–2004 result:
SQL executed:
SELECT club, "2003 - 2004 season" FROM public.t_2004_05_primeira_liga WHERE stadium ILIKE '%Coimbra%';
Result:
- Club = Académica de Coimbra; 2003 - 2004 season = 13th in the liga
Assessment of part B:
- Contradicted by data: 2nd place team is Benfica (Estádio da Luz). Estádio Cidade de Coimbra is Académica’s stadium, and they finished 13th.

Final assessment:
- First statement: Supported by the data.
- Second statement: Contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “liga” refers to the Portuguese Primeira Liga for the 2003–2004 season.
- “be in” / “be hold in” refer to the club’s home stadium association as recorded in the data.
