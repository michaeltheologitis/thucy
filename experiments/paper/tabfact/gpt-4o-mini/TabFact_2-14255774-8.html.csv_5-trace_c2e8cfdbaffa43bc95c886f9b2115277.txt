Claim to verify: “the average number of crowd in the game be 31,521 during the 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks season.”

Data source explored
- Available database objects: Only one table was found: public.t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season, which includes columns date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). No explicit home/away column is present; away games (if any) would be indicated by opponent values starting with '@'.

What the data shows
- The table contains 26 games, all classified as home (opponent NOT LIKE '@%').
- The average attendance across these games is 35,751.77, not 31,521.

Executed SQL and results
1) Overall counts and average
SQL:
SELECT AVG(attendance) AS average_attendance, COUNT(*) AS total_games, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN opponent LIKE '@%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS away_games, 
       SUM(CASE WHEN opponent NOT LIKE '@%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_games 
FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season;
Result:
- average_attendance = 35,751.77
- total_games = 26
- away_games = 0
- home_games = 26

2) Home-game average
SQL:
SELECT AVG(attendance) AS home_average_attendance 
FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season 
WHERE opponent NOT LIKE '@%';
Result:
- home_average_attendance = 35,751.77

3) Away-game average
SQL:
SELECT AVG(attendance) AS away_average_attendance 
FROM t_2008_arizona_diamondbacks_season 
WHERE opponent LIKE '@%';
Result:
- No away games present; average not applicable.

Conclusion
- Based on the available dataset, the average attendance for the listed 2008 Arizona Diamondbacks games (all home) is approximately 35,752, not 31,521. The claim is not supported by the data at hand.

Assumptions noted
- “Average number of crowd” is interpreted as average game attendance.
- Home vs away is inferred by opponent string starting with '@'. In this dataset, there are only home games (26), so the computed average reflects home attendance for those games listed. If the intended claim referred to the full season’s 81 home games, the available table does not contain those additional games; conclusions are constrained to the provided data.
