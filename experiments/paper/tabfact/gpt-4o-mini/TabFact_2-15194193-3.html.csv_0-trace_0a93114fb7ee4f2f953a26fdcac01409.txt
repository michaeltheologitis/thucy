Claim: “alberto pagani have only win with 2 team : linto and mv agusta.”

Summary of verification: Using the available database, Alberto Pagani’s wins are recorded only with two teams—Linto and MV Agusta. The data shows exactly two distinct teams with wins and provides totals by team.

Data source discovery
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema='public' ORDER BY table_name;
- Result: public.alberto_pagani

Table structure inspection
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema='public' AND table_name='alberto_pagani' 
  ORDER BY ordinal_position;
- Result (columns): year (bigint), class (text), team (text), points (bigint), wins (bigint)

Evidence 1: Distinct teams with at least one win
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT team FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 ORDER BY team;
- Output: Linto; MV Agusta

Evidence 2: Count of distinct winning teams
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS winning_teams_count FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0;
- Output: winning_teams_count = 2

Evidence 3: Total wins by team
- SQL executed:
  SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani WHERE wins > 0 GROUP BY team ORDER BY total_wins DESC, team ASC;
- Output:
  - team: linto, total_wins: 2
  - team: mv agusta, total_wins: 2

Conclusion

Assumptions
- “Wins” refers to the wins recorded in the table public.alberto_pagani and is the authoritative record available here.
- Team name casing/formatting differences (e.g., “linto” vs “Linto”) refer to the same teams.
