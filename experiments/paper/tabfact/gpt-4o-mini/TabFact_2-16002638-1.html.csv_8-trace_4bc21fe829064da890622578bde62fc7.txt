Claim to verify: “the dundee hurricane do not win the same number of game in any of the season they play between 2003 and 2009.”

Data sources explored
- Database identified: TabFact
- Relevant table: public.dundee_hurricanes
- Table schema (key columns): season (bigint), division (text), wins (bigint), losses (bigint), ties (bigint), final position (text), notes (text)

Evidence
1) Seasons 2003–2009 and wins
- SQL executed: SELECT season, wins FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season BETWEEN 2003 AND 2009 ORDER BY season;
- Result:
  - 2003: 6 wins
  - 2004: 6 wins
  - 2005: 5 wins
  - 2006: 3 wins
  - 2007: 9 wins
  - 2008: 5 wins
  - 2009: 2 wins

2) Duplicate win totals within 2003–2009
- SQL executed: SELECT wins, array_agg(season) AS seasons FROM dundee_hurricanes WHERE season BETWEEN 2003 AND 2009 GROUP BY wins HAVING COUNT(season) > 1;
- Result:
  - 5 wins: seasons 2005, 2008
  - 6 wins: seasons 2003, 2004

Conclusion
- The Dundee Hurricanes did record the same number of wins in multiple seasons between 2003 and 2009 (6 wins in both 2003 and 2004; 5 wins in both 2005 and 2008). This directly contradicts the claim that they did not win the same number of games in any season during that period.

Assumptions
- “dundee hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes team represented by the dundee_hurricanes table.
- The period “between 2003 and 2009” is interpreted as inclusive of both years.
- “Seasons they play” corresponds to seasons present in the table within that range.
