Scope of verification
- Data source discovered: PostgreSQL database with schema public and a single table: public.whlp. Columns: "call sign" (text), "frequency mhz" (double precision), "city of license" (text), "erp w" (bigint), "class" (text), "fcc info" (text).
- Interpreting “translator” as FM translator/low-power relay stations represented in the whlp table.

Evidence gathered
1) Find all entries for Englewood in the city of license field
SQL: SELECT "call sign", "frequency mhz", "city of license", "class", "fcc info" 
FROM public.whlp 
WHERE LOWER("city of license") LIKE LOWER('%Englewood%');
Result:
- call sign: w264bf | frequency mhz: 100.7 | city of license: englewood , illinois | class: d | fcc info: fcc

2) Count entries for Englewood
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS entry_count FROM public.whlp WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%englewood%';
Result: entry_count = 1

3) Distinct city-of-license values matched
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "city of license" FROM public.whlp WHERE "city of license" ILIKE '%englewood%';
Result: Englewood, Illinois

Conclusion
- The data show exactly 1 translator entry for Englewood, Illinois (call sign w264bf, 100.7 MHz, class d). The claim that Englewood, Illinois has 2 translators is not supported by this dataset.

Assumptions
- “Translator” refers to translator/low-power relay stations represented in the public.whlp table.
- “Englewood , illinois” refers to the city-of-license text in that table; matching performed case-insensitively and across possible formatting variations.
