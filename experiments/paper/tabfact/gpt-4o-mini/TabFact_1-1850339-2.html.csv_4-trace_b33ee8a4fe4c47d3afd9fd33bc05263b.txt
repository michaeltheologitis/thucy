Claim interpreted: The user asserts that for the 1983 season, the Air Force–Navy score is TBD (i.e., not determined/unknown).

Data source checked: PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing the table commander_in_chief_s_trophy with season-level results among the service academies.

Evidence retrieved:
1) Query to directly fetch the Air Force–Navy score for 1983
SQL executed:
SELECT "air force - navy score" FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 1983;
Result: "44 - 17"

2) Query to fetch the full 1983 record for context
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.commander_in_chief_s_trophy WHERE season = 1983;
Result:
- Season: 1983
- Trophy Winner: Air Force
- Air Force - Navy Score: 44 - 17
- Air Force - Army Score: 41 - 20
- Army - Navy Score: 42 - 13

Assessment:
The data explicitly lists the Air Force–Navy score for 1983 as 44 - 17. Therefore, the claim that the score is TBD is contradicted by the database.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted “be tbd” to mean the score is unknown or not yet determined for the 1983 season.
