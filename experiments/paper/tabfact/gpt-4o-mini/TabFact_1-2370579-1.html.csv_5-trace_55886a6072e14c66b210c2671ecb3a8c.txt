Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table the_baron. Columns: episode, prod, title, directed by, written by, originalairdate, filmed.

What I checked
1) Identify any episode(s) written by Tony O’Grady and see who directed them.
2) Check whether any episode is both written by Tony O’Grady and directed by John Moxey.
3) List episodes directed by John Moxey to confirm his contributions.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Writers present and titles attributed to Tony O’Grady
- Result excerpt shows Tony O’Grady credited for “The Long, Long Day.”
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT "written by", title FROM public.the_baron;

2) Details for the Tony O’Grady-written episode
- Episode Number: 26; Prod: 119; Title: The Long, Long Day; Writer: Tony O’Grady; Director: Roy Baker.
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, prod, title, "directed by", "written by" FROM the_baron WHERE "written by" = 'tony o''grady';

3) Does any episode have writer Tony O’Grady and director John Moxey?
- No rows returned (no such pairing in the dataset).
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by" 
FROM the_baron 
WHERE "written by" = 'Tony O''Grady' 
AND "directed by" = 'John Moxey';

4) Episodes directed by John Moxey (for context)
- Epitaph for a Hero (writer: Terry Nation)
- Red Horse, Red Rider (writer: Terry Nation)
- The Legions of Ammak (writer: Michael Cramoy)
- Samurai West (writer: Brian Degas)
- Portrait of Louisa (writer: Terry Nation)
SQL executed:
SELECT episode, title, "written by", "directed by" FROM the_baron WHERE "directed by" = 'john moxey';

Conclusion
- In this authoritative dataset for The Baron, the sole episode written by Tony O’Grady is “The Long, Long Day,” and it was directed by Roy Baker, not John Moxey. A direct search for any episode pairing writer Tony O’Grady with director John Moxey returns no results. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Notes/assumptions
- The database scope appears limited to the TV series The Baron. The statement in parentheses about Tony O’Grady being a pseudonym of Brian Clemens cannot be verified from this dataset; it neither confirms nor denies that biographical detail. The verification here addresses whether John Moxey directed the Tony O’Grady–written episode within The Baron.
