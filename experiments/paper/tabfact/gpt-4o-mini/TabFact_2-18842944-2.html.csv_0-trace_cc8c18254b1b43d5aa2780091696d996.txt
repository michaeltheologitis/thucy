Conclusion
- The data shows exactly 2 games in December for the 1976 Buffalo Bills season. The claim is supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- “game” refers to entries in the table public.t_1976_buffalo_bills_season (1976 regular-season schedule).
- Month identification is based on the text date field; case-insensitive matching (ILIKE) was used because the stored month names are lowercase (e.g., “december 5, 1976”).
