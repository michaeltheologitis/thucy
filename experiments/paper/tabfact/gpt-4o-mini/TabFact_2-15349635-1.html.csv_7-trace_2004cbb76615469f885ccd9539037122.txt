Claim to verify:
- "less than 3 team hold a minus goal difference , while more than 5 have score more goal against them"

Data source examined:
- public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football (authoritative dataset of Brazilian football, 1940)
- Relevant columns: team (text), against (bigint, goals conceded = GA), difference (text, goal difference = GD = GF − GA)

Evidence gathered (executed SQL and results):
1) SQL executed to list teams with parsed goal difference
SELECT team, against AS GA, difference AS diff_str,
       CAST(SUBSTRING(difference FROM '[+-]?[0-9]+') AS INTEGER) AS diff_int,
       (against + CAST(SUBSTRING(difference FROM '[+-]?[0-9]+') AS INTEGER)) AS GF
FROM public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football;

Returned rows (team, GA, diff_str, diff_int):
- flamengo: GA=12, diff_str=8, diff_int=8
- fluminense: GA=15, diff_str=10, diff_int=10
- corinthians: GA=15, diff_str=4, diff_int=4
- palestra itália: GA=19, diff_str=3, diff_int=3
- portuguesa: GA=23, diff_str=-10, diff_int=-10
- botafogo: GA=25, diff_str=0, diff_int=0
- vasco da gama: GA=19, diff_str=-2, diff_int=-2
- américa: GA=25, diff_str=-10, diff_int=-10
- são paulo: GA=24, diff_str=-13, diff_int=-13

Analysis grounded in the evidence:
- Teams with a minus (negative) goal difference (diff_int < 0): portuguesa, vasco da gama, américa, são paulo → count = 4.
  - This directly contradicts the claim "less than 3 team hold a minus goal difference" (4 is not less than 3).

- Interpreting "have score more goal against them" as having conceded more than they scored (GA > GF). Since GD = GF − GA, GA > GF is equivalent to GD < 0. From above, the count with GD < 0 is 4.
  - This contradicts "more than 5" (4 is not more than 5).

- Even under an alternative interpretation of the second clause as "have scored more than they conceded" (GF > GA, i.e., GD > 0), the count of positive GD teams from the evidence is 4 (flamengo, fluminense, corinthians, palestra itália) → also not more than 5.

Conclusion:
- Both parts of the claim are contradicted by the data. There are 4 teams with negative goal difference (not fewer than 3), and only 4 teams either conceded more than they scored (if interpreted that way) or scored more than they conceded (alternative interpretation) — in either case, not more than 5.

Assumptions made (stated after analysis):
- The claim refers to the teams in the 1940 Brazilian football dataset contained in public.t_1940_in_brazilian_football.
- "Minus goal difference" means goal difference (GF − GA) < 0.
- "Have score more goal against them" is primarily interpreted as GA > GF (conceded more than scored). I also evaluated the alternative interpretation (GF > GA) for completeness; neither supports the claim.
