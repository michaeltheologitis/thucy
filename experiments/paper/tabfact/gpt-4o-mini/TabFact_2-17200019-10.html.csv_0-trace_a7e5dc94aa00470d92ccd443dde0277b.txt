Claim interpreted: There are 4 players who scored a total of 3 goals, and all 4 are in league 4.

Data source explored:
- Table: public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season
- Relevant columns: player (text), league (bigint), total (bigint)

Checks and evidence:
1) How many players have total = 3?
- Result: 5 players
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS player_count FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3;

2) Which players have total = 3, and what are their leagues?
- Result:
  - Lucas Biglia — league 2 — total 3
  - Dmitri Bulykin — league 3 — total 3
  - Jan Polák — league 2 — total 3
  - Matías Suárez — league 1 — total 3
  - Jelle Van Damme — league 3 — total 3
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, league, total FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3;

3) Are there any players with total = 3 in league 4?
- Result: 0 players
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season WHERE total = 3 AND league = 4;

4) Does league 4 exist in the dataset and how many players are in it overall?
- Result: League 4 exists with 3 players in total (but none with total = 3)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT league, COUNT(DISTINCT player) AS player_count FROM public.t_2008_09_r_s_c_anderlecht_season GROUP BY league;

Conclusion:
- The claim is contradicted by the data. There are 5 (not 4) players with total = 3, and none of them are in league 4.

Assumptions made:
- “score 3 goal total” refers to the column total = 3, representing total goals for the season per player in this dataset.
- “league 4” refers to rows where league = 4.
- Scope is limited to the R.S.C. Anderlecht 2008–2009 season table available.
