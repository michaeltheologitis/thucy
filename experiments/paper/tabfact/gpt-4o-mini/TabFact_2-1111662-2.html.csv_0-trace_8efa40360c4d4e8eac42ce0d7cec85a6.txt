Claim: “Tatyana Lebedeva be the athlete in the triple jump event.”

What I checked
- Explored the available data sources and found a single table: public.memorial_van_damme with columns (event, record, athlete, nationality, date).
- Queried this table for entries related to “Triple Jump.”

Evidence from data
- Result found:
  - Event: Triple Jump
  - Athlete: Tatyana Lebedeva
  - Nationality: Russia
  - Record: 15.14 m ( + 0.3 m / s)
  - Date: 5 September 2003

Executed SQL (exact):
SELECT event, athlete, nationality, record, date FROM memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE 'Triple Jump' OR event ILIKE '%Triple Jump%';

Conclusion
- The data shows that for the Memorial Van Damme dataset, the athlete listed for the Triple Jump event is Tatyana Lebedeva. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- Because only the Memorial Van Damme table is available, I interpret the claim in the context of this meet’s event listing/record. The verification pertains to this dataset specifically, not to all competitions globally.
