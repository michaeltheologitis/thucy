Assumptions
- Interpreted “the 2006 season” as the Texas Rangers’ 2006 MLB season, based on the available data source.
- Interpreted “final game score be 7 - 2” to mean any game ending with a final score of 7 - 2, regardless of which team won.
- The score field is treated as authoritative for the final score and was normalized by removing spaces to ensure consistent matching.
