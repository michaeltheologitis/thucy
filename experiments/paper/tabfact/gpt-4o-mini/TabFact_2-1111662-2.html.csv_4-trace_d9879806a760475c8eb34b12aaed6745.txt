Claim to verify: “the pole vault record be set on the 26th of August 2005.”

Data source discovery
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Schema: public
- Table: memorial_van_damme (event text, record text, athlete text, nationality text, date text)

Evidence
1) Retrieve pole vault entries
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE event ILIKE '%pole vault%';
Result (relevant row):
- Athlete: Yelena Isinbayeva; Event: Pole Vault; Record: 4.93 m; Nationality: Russia; Date: 26 August 2005

2) Verify the specific date (casting text date to date)
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE date::date = '2005-08-26';
Result (relevant row):
- Athlete: Yelena Isinbayeva; Event: Pole Vault; Record: 4.93 m; Nationality: Russia; Date: 26 August 2005

3) Combine event and date condition
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.memorial_van_damme WHERE LOWER(event) LIKE '%pole%' AND date::date = '2005-08-26';
Result:
- Athlete: Yelena Isinbayeva; Event: Pole Vault; Record: 4.93 m; Nationality: Russia; Date: 26 August 2005

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that a pole vault record at the Memorial Van Damme meet was set on 26 August 2005 by Yelena Isinbayeva (4.93 m). This supports the claim that a pole vault record was set on that date.

Assumptions
- “Record” refers to the record tracked by the memorial_van_damme table (i.e., meet record context), as that is the available authoritative dataset.
