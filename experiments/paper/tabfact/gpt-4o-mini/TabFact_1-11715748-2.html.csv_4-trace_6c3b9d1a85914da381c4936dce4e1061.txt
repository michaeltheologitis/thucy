Claim to verify: “Funhouse [is] directed by Al Katz and written by Gilbert Adler.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data: A PostgreSQL database with a table: public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes (Freddy’s Nightmares episodes).
- Schema (relevant columns): season, title, "director (s)", "writer (s)", "original airdate".

Evidence from the database
- Query used:
SELECT season, title, "director (s)", "writer (s)", "original airdate" 
FROM public.list_of_freddy_s_nightmares_episodes 
WHERE title ILIKE 'Funhouse';

- Result:
  - Season: 17
  - Title: Funhouse
  - Director(s): Gilbert Adler
  - Writer(s): Al Katz and Gilbert Adler
  - Original Airdate: February 5, 1990

Assessment
- Direction: The data shows the episode “Funhouse” was directed by Gilbert Adler, not Al Katz. This contradicts the claim.
- Writing: The data shows it was written by Al Katz and Gilbert Adler. The claim credits Gilbert Adler (which is true), but omits Al Katz as a co-writer.

Conclusion
- The claim is partly incorrect: the director attribution is wrong, while the writing credit is only partially stated (missing co-writer Al Katz).

Assumptions
- Interpreted “funhouse” as the Freddy’s Nightmares episode titled “Funhouse,” since that is the available authoritative data source.
