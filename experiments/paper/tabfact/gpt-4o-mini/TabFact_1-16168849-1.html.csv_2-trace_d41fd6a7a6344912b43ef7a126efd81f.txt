Claim to verify: “the college whose nickname is ‘Blue Hose’ joined in 1972 and is a member of the SAC.”

Data discovery and schema
- Discovered data source: PostgreSQL database with schema public and table north_state_conference.
- Columns (from information_schema): founded (bigint), enrollment (bigint), type (text), nickname (text), joined (text), left (text), institution (text), current conference (text), location (text).

Executed SQL for discovery
1) List schemas
SELECT schema_name
FROM information_schema.schemata;

2) List tables in public
SELECT table_schema, table_name
FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

3) List columns
SELECT table_schema, table_name, column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public';

4) Row count snapshot
SELECT n.nspname AS schema_name, c.relname AS table_name, n.nspname || '.' || c.relname AS full_table_name, COUNT(*) AS row_count
FROM pg_class c
JOIN pg_namespace n ON n.oid = c.relnamespace
JOIN pg_stat_all_tables st ON st.relid = c.oid
WHERE n.nspname = 'public'
GROUP BY n.nspname, c.relname;

Evidence from the data
A) Full table view (used to inspect available rows)
SELECT * FROM public.north_state_conference;

B) Direct lookup of the “Blue Hose” entry
- Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, nickname, joined, "left", "current conference" 
FROM public.north_state_conference 
WHERE trim(lower(nickname)) = 'blue hose';
- Result:
Institution: Presbyterian College
Nickname: Blue Hose
Joined: 1965
Left: 1972
Current Conference: Big South (NCAA Division I)

C) Check whether any “Blue Hose” entry is currently in the SAC
- Executed SQL:
SELECT institution FROM public.north_state_conference 
WHERE trim(lower(nickname)) = 'blue hose' 
AND trim(lower("current conference")) = 'sac';
- Result: No rows

D) Check whether any “Blue Hose” entry shows joined = 1972
- Executed SQL:
SELECT institution, nickname, joined, "left" 
FROM public.north_state_conference 
WHERE trim(lower(nickname)) = 'blue hose' AND joined = '1972';
- Result: No rows

Assessment
- The dataset identifies the college with the nickname “Blue Hose” as Presbyterian College.
- According to the data, Presbyterian College joined in 1965 and left in 1972 (it did not join in 1972).
- The “current conference” listed for Presbyterian College is Big South (NCAA Division I), not SAC.
- Therefore, the claim that the Blue Hose “joined in 1972 and are a member of the SAC” is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate based on the authoritative dataset queried above.

Assumptions
- “SAC” is interpreted as the South Atlantic Conference.
- The “joined” and “left” fields refer to the membership years within the conference context represented by the north_state_conference table, and “current conference” indicates the institution’s present affiliation.
