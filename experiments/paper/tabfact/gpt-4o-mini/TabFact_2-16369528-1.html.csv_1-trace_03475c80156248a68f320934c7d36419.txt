Claim interpreted: The user implies that, in 1998, the Lifetime Achievement award had no recipient (i.e., N/A) for the Ned Kelly Awards.

Evidence from the data
1) Retrieve the Lifetime Achievement value for 1998
- Result: na.
- Executed SQL: SELECT "lifetime achievement" FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE year = 1998;

2) Verify uniqueness of the 1998 record
- Result: 1 row for year 1998
- Executed SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.ned_kelly_awards WHERE year = 1998;

Analysis
- The table public.ned_kelly_awards stores the 1998 Lifetime Achievement value as "na.", indicating no award/recipient for that year. This aligns with the claim that it was N/A in 1998. Minor formatting differences between "n / a" and "na." are not substantive.

Conclusion
- The data supports that there was no recipient (N/A) for the Lifetime Achievement award in 1998.

Assumptions
- The award referenced is the Ned Kelly Awards Lifetime Achievement category, based on the available data source containing that category and year.
