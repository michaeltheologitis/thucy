Summary of approach
- I first discovered what data is available, then examined the table structure, and finally queried the data to check whether Jordan Farmar led the team in points for five consecutive games.

Data sources discovered
- One table found: public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season (appears to cover late-season games for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets).

Schema details
- Columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).
- The “high points” column lists the player and their points for each game’s team-leading scorer.

Evidence gathered
1) Count how many games are present (to understand scope):
SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season;
Result: total_games = 7

2) List all games with the Nets’ high-points leader (to see who led and whether Farmar appears, and to check for any run of 5 straight games):
SQL: SELECT game, date, "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season ORDER BY game ASC;
Result:
- Game 75 | April 1  | Brandan Wright (15)
- Game 76 | April 3  | Deron Williams (18)
- Game 77 | April 5  | Brook Lopez (30)
- Game 78 | April 6  | Brook Lopez (39)
- Game 79 | April 8  | Brook Lopez (27)
- Game 80 | April 10 | Brook Lopez (35)
- Game 81 | April 11 | Brook Lopez (31)

3) Explicitly search for any game where Jordan Farmar is the high-points leader:
SQL: SELECT DISTINCT "high points" FROM public.t_2010_11_new_jersey_nets_season WHERE "high points" ILIKE '%Farmar%';
Result: 0 rows (no entries with “Farmar”)

Assessment
- Within the available dataset (7 late-season games for the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets), Jordan Farmar does not appear as the team’s high-points leader in any game. Therefore, in this dataset he did not lead the team in points for five straight games (nor even once).

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions and scope notes
- Assumed the claim refers to the 2010–11 New Jersey Nets because that is the only available dataset. “Lead the team in points” was interpreted as the player listed in the “high points” column for each game.
- The table contains only 7 games (games 75–81). The conclusion is limited to these games; if you intended a different team/season, the result could differ.
