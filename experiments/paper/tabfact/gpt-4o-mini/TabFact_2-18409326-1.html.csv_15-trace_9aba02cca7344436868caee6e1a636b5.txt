Summary
- Claim evaluated: “there be more than one classic rock station.” Interpreted as: Are there more than one classic rock radio stations in the available dataset (Kelowna)?
- Finding: The data shows exactly one classic rock station in the Kelowna dataset; therefore, “more than one” is not supported.

Data source discovery and structure
- Discovered database: PostgreSQL with schema public and table media_in_kelowna.

Evidence 1: Data source and columns
- Result: Found table public.media_in_kelowna with columns frequency, call sign, branding, format, owner.
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT table_name, table_schema FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema NOT IN ('information_schema', 'pg_catalog');
  - SELECT table_name, column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name ILIKE '%radio%' OR table_name ILIKE '%media%' OR table_name ILIKE '%stations%';

Evidence 2: Count classic rock stations
- Result: COUNT = 1
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%classic rock%';

Evidence 3: List classic rock stations
- Result (1 row):
  - Frequency: 96.3 FM
  - Call Sign: CKKO - FM
  - Branding: K96.3
  - Format: Classic Rock
  - Owner: Sun Country Cablevision
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT * FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%classic rock%';

Evidence 4: Cross-check for other rock formats (to contextualize)
- Result: 2 stations with any kind of rock format; only one of them is Classic Rock.
  - 96.3 FM, CKKO - FM, K96.3, Classic Rock
  - 104.7 FM, CKLZ - FM, Power 104, Active Rock
- SQL executed:
  - SELECT frequency, "call sign", branding, format FROM public.media_in_kelowna WHERE format ILIKE '%rock%';

Conclusion
- The dataset shows exactly one Classic Rock station in Kelowna. The claim that there are more than one classic rock station is not supported by the available data.

- Definition: “Classic rock station” means stations whose format field contains the phrase “classic rock.”
