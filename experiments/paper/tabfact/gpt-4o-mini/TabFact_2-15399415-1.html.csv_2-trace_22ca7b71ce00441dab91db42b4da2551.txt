- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: orlando_pizzolato
  - Columns: year (bigint), competition (text), venue (text), position (text), notes (text)

Evidence collected
1) Retrieve all entries for 1986
- Result: Year=1986; Competition=European championships; Venue=Stuttgart, West Germany; Position=2nd; Notes=2:10:57

  - Year=1984; Competition=New York City Marathon; Notes=2:14:53
  - Year=1985; Competition=New York City Marathon; Notes=2:11:34
- No row for 1986 appears for New York City Marathon.
- Executed SQL: SELECT year, competition, notes FROM public.orlando_pizzolato WHERE competition ILIKE '%New York%';

Assessment
- The data contains no entry for the New York City Marathon in 1986 for Orlando Pizzolato. The only 1986 entry in this dataset is the European Championships with a notes time of 2:10:57.
- Therefore, the claim that the “note record” for the New York City Marathon in 1986 is 2:15:20 is not supported by the available data.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the evidence from the TabFact database.

Assumptions made due to ambiguity
- “note record” was interpreted as the “notes” time recorded in the orlando_pizzolato table.
- The claim was interpreted as referring to Orlando Pizzolato’s record for the New York City Marathon in 1986 (the only New York–related data available in the accessible source).
