Claim interpreted: For the matches that took place on 18 June (in the available dataset), the team with the second-highest score was Carlton.

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL data source with a single relevant table: public.t_1938_vfl_season (1938 VFL season matches). Columns include: "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "venue", "crowd", and "date" (all per the schema tool).

Evidence from executed SQL
1) Retrieve sample rows (covers all matches in table) with teams, scores, and date
SQL executed:
SELECT "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", "date"
FROM public.t_1938_vfl_season
LIMIT 10;

Result returned by the tool (abridged to relevant fields):
- Geelong 11.23 (89) vs Hawthorn 6.13 (49) — 18 June 1938
- Fitzroy 16.12 (108) vs South Melbourne 8.8 (56) — 18 June 1938
- St Kilda 14.12 (96) vs Melbourne 16.16 (112) — 18 June 1938
- Richmond 15.14 (104) vs Essendon 15.9 (99) — 18 June 1938
- Footscray 13.9 (87) vs Collingwood 10.5 (65) — 18 June 1938
- North Melbourne 11.5 (71) vs Carlton 16.25 (121) — 18 June 1938

Analysis based on the evidence
- All listed matches occurred on 18 June 1938 in this table.
- Extracting the total points (the number in parentheses) for each team:
  - Carlton: 121
  - Melbourne: 112
  - Fitzroy: 108
  - Richmond: 104
  - Essendon: 99
  - St Kilda: 96
  - Geelong: 89
  - Footscray: 87
  - Collingwood: 65
  - North Melbourne: 71
  - South Melbourne: 56
  - Hawthorn: 49
- Ordering these totals descending gives: 121 (Carlton), 112 (Melbourne), 108 (Fitzroy), 104 (Richmond), …
- Therefore, the second-highest team score on 18 June 1938 was 112 by Melbourne, not Carlton. Carlton had the highest score (121).

Conclusion
- The claim that the second-highest score team on 18 June was Carlton is contradicted by the data. Carlton had the highest score; Melbourne had the second-highest.

Assumptions made
- “the game that happen on the 18th of june” is interpreted as the round of matches played on 18 June 1938 in the provided dataset (since all entries share that date and the dataset covers the 1938 VFL season).
- “second highest score team” means the team with the second-largest total points (the value in parentheses in the score string) among all teams that played on that date.
