What I checked
- Data source discovery: Found a PostgreSQL database with schema public and a single table tam_tank containing variant columns for the TAM family (e.g., vctp, "vca 155").
- Schema inspection: Columns are text fields representing different variants; each row corresponds to a specific attribute (e.g., weight, armament, power-to-weight, max speed).
- Data retrieval: Pulled the full contents of public.tam_tank to verify power-to-weight and top speed values for VCTP and VCA 155.

Executed SQL (evidence)
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
- Returned rows (relevant excerpts):
  - Power-to-weight row: vctp = "24hp / t (23hp / ton)"; vca 155 = "18hp / t (16.5hp / ton)"
  - Max speed row: vca 155 = "55 km / h (34 mph)"

Assessment of the claim
- "VCTP 24hp / t (23hp / ton)": Supported by the data (matches the power-to-weight row for vctp).
- "VCA 155 of 18hp / t (16.5hp / ton)": Supported by the data (matches the power-to-weight row for vca 155).
- "and not 55 km / h (34 mph)": Contradicted by the data; the table explicitly lists the VCA 155 top speed as 55 km/h (34 mph).

Conclusion
- The power-to-weight figures are correct for both VCTP and VCA 155.
- The assertion that it is not 55 km/h (34 mph) is inconsistent with the database, which lists 55 km/h (34 mph) for the VCA 155.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the VCTP and VCA 155 variants of the TAM family and their specifications.
- Interpreted "t" as metric tonnes and "ton" as short tons, consistent with the table’s notation.
