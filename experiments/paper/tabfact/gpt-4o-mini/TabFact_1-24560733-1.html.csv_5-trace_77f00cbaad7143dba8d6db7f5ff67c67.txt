Assessment
- In the only available authoritative dataset (1947 Kentucky Wildcats football), Kentucky’s opponents were held scoreless in 4 games, not 10. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data at hand.

Assumptions made
- “Wildcats” refers to the Kentucky Wildcats football team, and the claim pertains to the 1947 season because that is the sole available data source discovered. If another team or season was intended, it is not represented in the accessible data environment.
