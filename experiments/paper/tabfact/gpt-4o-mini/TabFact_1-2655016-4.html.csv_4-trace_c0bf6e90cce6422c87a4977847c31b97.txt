Claim interpreted: The episode with series = 47 was aired in a different month and year than the episode that has season = 2.

Data source discovery
- Available database: a PostgreSQL instance with a table public.list_of_all_that_episodes that contains episode metadata.

Table structure (validated)
- Columns (name → type):
  - season → bigint
  - series → bigint
  - episode title → text
  - original air date → text
  - nick prod → bigint

SQL (data types evidence)
SELECT column_name, data_type
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'list_of_all_that_episodes';

Key evidence 1: Identify the episode with series = 47 and the episode with season = 2, and parse month/year
SQL
SELECT series, season, "episode title", "original air date",
       to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date,
       to_char(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'), 'FMMonth') AS month_name,
       extract(year FROM to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS year
FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes
WHERE series = 47 OR season = 2
ORDER BY CASE WHEN series = 47 THEN 0 ELSE 1 END, season;

Result
- Series 47: Season 10, Episode Title: Chris Farley / Mint Condition; Original Air Date: January 11, 1997; Parsed Month/Year: January 1997.
- Season 2: Series 39, Episode Title: Montell Jordan; Original Air Date: November 23, 1996; Parsed Month/Year: November 1996.

Key evidence 2: Direct comparison of month and year between the two episodes
SQL
WITH s47 AS (
  SELECT to_char(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'), 'FMMonth') AS month_name,
         extract(year FROM to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS year
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE series = 47
), s2 AS (
  SELECT to_char(to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'), 'FMMonth') AS month_name,
         extract(year FROM to_date(initcap(regexp_replace("original air date", '\\s*,\\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS year
  FROM public.list_of_all_that_episodes WHERE season = 2
)
SELECT 
  s47.month_name AS series47_month,
  s47.year AS series47_year,
  s2.month_name AS season2_month,
  s2.year AS season2_year,
  (s47.month_name <> s2.month_name) AS different_month,
  (s47.year <> s2.year) AS different_year
FROM s47 CROSS JOIN s2;

Result
- Series 47 Month/Year: January 1997
- Season 2 Month/Year: November 1996
- Different Month: Yes
- Different Year: Yes

Conclusion
- The episode with series 47 aired in January 1997, while the episode with season 2 aired in November 1996. Both the month and the year differ. The claim is supported by the data.
