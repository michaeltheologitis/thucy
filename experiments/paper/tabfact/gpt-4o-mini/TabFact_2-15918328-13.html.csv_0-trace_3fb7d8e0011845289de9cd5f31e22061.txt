Claim interpreted: “Sonya Tayeh is the jazz choreographer.” I interpret this as asserting that Sonya Tayeh is (or is known as) a jazz choreographer, potentially in the context of So You Think You Can Dance (SYTYCD).

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
  - Columns: couple (text), style (text), music (text), choreographer(s) (text), results (text)

What I attempted to verify
1) Check whether Sonya Tayeh appears in the Season 4 dataset and, if so, whether her listed style is jazz.

Executed-SQL evidence (intended)
Note: Due to a tool execution limit reached during this session, the following exact SQL could not be executed to return results. Therefore, no row-level evidence could be retrieved from the database in this run.
- Intended SQL 1: Search for entries with Sonya Tayeh
  SELECT couple, style, music, "choreographer(s)", results
  FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
  WHERE "choreographer(s)" ILIKE '%Sonya Tayeh%';

- Intended SQL 2: If present, verify her style is jazz
  SELECT style, COUNT(*)
  FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
  WHERE "choreographer(s)" ILIKE '%Sonya Tayeh%'
  GROUP BY style;

- Intended SQL 3: Context — who is labeled for Jazz in Season 4
  SELECT DISTINCT "choreographer(s)"
  FROM public.so_you_think_you_can_dance_u_s_season_4
  WHERE style ILIKE '%jazz%';

Assessment
- The only available structured data source covers SYTYCD U.S. Season 4. Without executing the queries above, there is no evidence from the database returned that:
  a) Sonya Tayeh appears in this table, or
  b) She is associated with the jazz style within this dataset.
- Consequently, within the scope of accessible data, the claim is unsupported. I cannot confirm it from this dataset.

Conclusion
- The claim is unsupported by the available evidence in the connected data (Season 4 table). I cannot verify it as true from this data source.

Assumptions made
- The claim refers to Sonya Tayeh’s choreographic style/credit and may be intended in the SYTYCD context. The only accessible dataset is limited to SYTYCD U.S. Season 4, which may not contain Sonya Tayeh at all. No broader choreographer database is available in this environment to confirm her general professional style.
