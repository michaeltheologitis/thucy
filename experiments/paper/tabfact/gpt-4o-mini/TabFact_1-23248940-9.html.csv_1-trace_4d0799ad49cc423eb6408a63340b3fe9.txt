Claim interpreted: “Stephen Jackson led the team in points for the most games.” I verified this against the available data for the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats (games 47–56) in the connected database.

Data source discovery
- Finding: One accessible table in the public schema appears to hold game-by-game leaders for the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats.
- Executed SQL (as returned by tool):
  1) List tables and row counts
     SELECT table_name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM pg_catalog.pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public') AS row_count FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  2) Count rows in the specific table
     SELECT table_name, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "public"."t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season") AS row_count FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

Schema inspection
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, ordinal_position 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season';
- Relevant columns: game (bigint), date (text), team (text), score (text), high points (text), high rebounds (text), high assists (text), location attendance (text), record (text).

Raw data sample (all available rows)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season;
- Summary of “High Points” leaders across 10 games (Games 47–56):
  - Raymond Felton (23) — 1 occurrence
  - Stephen Jackson (30, 26, 22, 33, 29, 35) — 6 occurrences
  - Gerald Wallace (21, 32, 27) — 3 occurrences

Computation: Who led in points most often?
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT split_part("high points", ' (', 1) AS player, COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.t_2009_10_charlotte_bobcats_season
  GROUP BY player
  ORDER BY count DESC;
- Result:
  - Stephen Jackson — 6 games
  - Gerald Wallace — 3 games
  - Raymond Felton — 1 game

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset (10 games from the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season), Stephen Jackson led the team in points in more games than any other teammate. This supports the claim for this specific slice of games.

Assumptions and scope notes
- The connected database only contains games 47–56 of the 2009–10 Charlotte Bobcats season. I assume the claim refers to this available sample. If the intent was the entire 2009–10 season or Stephen Jackson’s tenure across all teams, additional data would be required to verify beyond this subset.
