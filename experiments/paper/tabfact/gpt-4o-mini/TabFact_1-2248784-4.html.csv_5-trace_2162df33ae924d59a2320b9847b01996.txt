Claim being checked: “Qatar is ranked 8th in the Middle East for GDP.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with a table: list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp (GDP measured in PPP terms, 2011).

Relevant schema (summary)
- Columns: "rank mideast" (bigint), "rank asia" (bigint), "rank world" (bigint), country (text), "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd" (double precision).

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Locate Qatar and its Middle East rank
- SQL:
SELECT country, "rank mideast", "rank asia", "rank world"
FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
WHERE country ILIKE '%qat%';
- Result:
  - Country: Qatar; Rank Mideast: 5; Rank Asia: 21; Rank World: 55

2) List all Middle East ranks to provide context
- SQL:
SELECT country, "rank mideast", "2011 gdp (ppp) billions of usd"
FROM list_of_asian_and_pacific_countries_by_gdp_ppp
WHERE "rank mideast" IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY "rank mideast" ASC;
- Result (rank mideast → country — 2011 GDP (PPP) billions USD):
  1 → Iran — 930.236
  2 → Saudi Arabia — 677.663
  3 → United Arab Emirates — 261.189
  4 → Israel — 235.446
  5 → Qatar — 181.912
  6 → Kuwait — 150.002
  7 → Iraq — 127.348
  8 → Syria — 107.803
  9 → Oman — 81.005
  10 → Yemen — 63.344
  11 → Lebanon — 61.738
  12 → Jordan — 36.897
  13 → Bahrain — 30.889

Conclusion
- In this authoritative dataset (2011 GDP measured by PPP), Qatar is ranked 5th in the Middle East, not 8th. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “GDP” is interpreted as GDP at purchasing power parity (PPP) for 2011, consistent with the available dataset.
- “Middle East” membership is taken as defined implicitly by the table’s "rank mideast" field. Rankings for other GDP definitions (e.g., nominal GDP) or different years could differ, but the conclusion here is based strictly on the provided data.
