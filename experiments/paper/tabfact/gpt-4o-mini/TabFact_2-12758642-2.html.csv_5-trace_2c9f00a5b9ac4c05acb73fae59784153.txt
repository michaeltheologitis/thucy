Claim interpreted: The bout against Hikaru Sato that ended after round 2 took place in Tokyo, Japan.

Data source discovery:
- Available schema/table: public.katsuya_inoue (columns: res, record, opponent, method, event, round, time, location)

Evidence gathered:
1) Search for bouts vs Hikaru Sato (broad match)
SQL:
SELECT res, opponent, event, round, location, method 
FROM public.katsuya_inoue 
WHERE LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%hikaru%' OR LOWER(opponent) LIKE '%sato%';
Result excerpt (relevant row): opponent = Hikaru Sato; event = Pancrase - Brave 6; round = 1; location = Tokyo, Japan; method = TKO (Punches)

2) Retrieve full row for Hikaru Sato
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Hikaru%';
Result: event = pancrase - brave 6; location = tokyo, japan; method = tko (punches); opponent = hikaru sato; record = 5 - 2; res = win; round = 1; time = 3:53

3) Check for any Hikaru Sato bout ending after round 2 (round >= 3)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.katsuya_inoue WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Hikaru Sato%' AND round >= 3;
Result: 0 rows

Assessment:
- The only recorded bout vs Hikaru Sato ended in round 1, not after round 2. While that bout’s location is Tokyo, Japan, there is no bout vs Hikaru Sato that ended after round 2 in this dataset.

Conclusion: The claim that “Tokyo, Japan is the location of the match that ended after round 2 against Hikaru Sato” is not supported; such a match does not exist in the data.

Assumptions:
- “End after round 2” interpreted as bouts that ended in round 3 or later.
- The claim pertains to the bouts listed in public.katsuya_inoue (Katsuya Inoue’s fight record).
