Evidence
1) Sample rows to confirm date formatting and opponent naming
SQL executed:
SELECT date, opponents, "h / a", "result f - a", attendance, "league position"

WHERE opponents = 'blackburn rovers' 
ORDER BY date ASC;

WHERE opponents = 'blackburn rovers'
AND to_date(initcap(date),'DD Month YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005', 'DD Month YYYY');
Result: 2

4) Count losses in those matches
SQL executed:

FROM t_2005_06_manchester_united_f_c_season
WHERE opponents = 'blackburn rovers'
AND to_date(initcap(date),'DD Month YYYY') >= to_date('13 August 2005', 'DD Month YYYY')
AND split_part("result f - a", ' - ', 1)::int < split_part("result f - a", ' - ', 2)::int;
Result: 2
