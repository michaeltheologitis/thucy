Claim interpreted: All the matches are on the same date.

Data source discovery
- Evidence: Listing all tables confirms the dataset exists.
  SQL:
  SELECT table_schema, table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_type = 'BASE TABLE' ORDER BY table_schema, table_name;
  Finding: Table public.t_1975_vfl_season is present.

Schema inspection
- Evidence: Columns of public.t_1975_vfl_season.
  SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
  AND table_name = 't_1975_vfl_season';
  Finding: Columns include date (text), along with home team, home team score, away team, away team score, venue, crowd.

Verification steps and evidence
1) Count distinct dates
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT date) AS distinct_date_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
  Result: 1 distinct date.

2) List distinct date value(s)
  SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT date FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
  Result: 7 June 1975.

3) Total number of matches and checks for missing dates
  SQL (total rows):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_matches FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season;
  Result: 6.
  SQL (NULL or empty dates):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS null_or_empty_dates FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season WHERE date IS NULL OR trim(date) = '';
  Result: 0.

4) Match counts by date
  SQL:
  SELECT date, COUNT(*) AS match_count FROM public.t_1975_vfl_season GROUP BY date ORDER BY date;
  Result: 7 June 1975 — 6 matches.

Conclusion
- All 6 matches in public.t_1975_vfl_season occur on the same date: 7 June 1975. No rows have missing or empty dates. The claim is fully supported by the data.
