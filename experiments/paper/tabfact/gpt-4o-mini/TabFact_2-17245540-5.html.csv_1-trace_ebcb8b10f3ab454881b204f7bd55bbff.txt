Claim interpreted: In the available 1973 U.S. Open Golf dataset, players from the United States and New Zealand tied for 3rd place.

Data source explored
- Discovered database: public schema with table t_1973_u_s_open_golf (place, player, country, score, "to par").

How places and ties are encoded
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf;
- Result: 1; 2; t3; t6 (ties indicated by a leading lowercase 't')

Evidence: who finished tied for 3rd (t3)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT player, country, place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't3';
- Result rows:
  - Player: Jack Nicklaus; Country: United States; Place: t3; Score: 71 + 69 = 140; To Par: -2
  - Player: Johnny Miller; Country: United States; Place: t3; Score: 71 + 69 = 140; To Par: -2
  - Player: Bob Charles; Country: New Zealand; Place: t3; Score: 71 + 69 = 140; To Par: -2

Country counts among t3 finishers
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT country, COUNT(player) AS player_count FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE place = 't3' GROUP BY country;
- Result:
  - United States: 2
  - New Zealand: 1

Conclusion
- The dataset shows that the tie for 3rd place (t3) included players from both the United States and New Zealand. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the available dataset (1973 U.S. Open Golf), since this is the only accessible data source.
- “Tie for 3rd place” corresponds to place = 't3' in this dataset.
