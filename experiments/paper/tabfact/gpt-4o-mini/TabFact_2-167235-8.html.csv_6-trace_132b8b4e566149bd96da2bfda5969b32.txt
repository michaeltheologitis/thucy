Claim to verify: “Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi and Pandeli Majko (1st time) be all member of the Democratic Party of Albania.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows all four listed individuals are associated with the Socialist Party of Albania (not the Democratic Party of Albania). Therefore, the claim is false.

Data source discovery and schema confirmation
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 'list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania';
- Resulting columns: name; born - died; term start; term end; political party

Evidence 1: Party affiliation for the named individuals
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "political party", "term start", "term end" 
  FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
  WHERE name ILIKE '%Meta%' OR name ILIKE '%Fino%' OR name ILIKE '%Bufi%' OR name ILIKE '%Majko%';
- Returned rows:
  - ylli bufi | socialist party of albania | 5 June 1991 | 10 December 1991
  - bashkim fino | socialist party of albania | 11 March 1997 | 24 July 1997
  - pandeli majko (1st time) | socialist party of albania | 2 October 1998 | 29 October 1999
  - ilir meta | socialist party of albania | 29 October 1999 | 22 February 2002
  - pandeli majko (2nd time) | socialist party of albania | 22 February 2002 | 31 July 2002

Interpretation: For each of the four figures named in the claim (including the specified “Pandeli Majko (1st time)”), the political party recorded is “socialist party of albania,” not the Democratic Party of Albania.

Evidence 2: Cross-check who is listed from the Democratic Party of Albania
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "term start", "term end", "political party" 
  FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania 
  WHERE LOWER("political party") LIKE LOWER('%democratic party of albania%');
- Returned rows:
  - Aleksandër Meksi | 13 April 1992 | 11 March 1997 | Democratic Party of Albania
  - Sali Berisha | 11 September 2005 | 15 September 2013 | Democratic Party of Albania

Interpretation: The database shows Democratic Party prime ministers as Aleksandër Meksi and Sali Berisha, not the four individuals listed in the claim.

Conclusion based on data: The claim that Ilir Meta, Bashkim Fino, Ylli Bufi, and Pandeli Majko (1st time) “are all members of the Democratic Party of Albania” is contradicted by the data. All four are recorded with the Socialist Party of Albania.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “be all member of the democratic party of albania” as asserting their party affiliation (membership) is the Democratic Party of Albania, as indicated in the “political party” field for their prime ministerial entries.
- Used case-insensitive matching on names to retrieve relevant rows and relied on the table’s “political party” values as authoritative for affiliation at the time of service.
