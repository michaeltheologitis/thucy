Claim interpreted: “Alberto Pagani averaged 40 points in the races he won.”

Data source exploration
- Discovered data source: a PostgreSQL database with schema public and a single table alberto_pagani.
- Schema (via inspection): alberto_pagani(year bigint, class text, team text, points bigint, wins bigint).

Evidence from data
1) Full table extraction
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Key rows (wins > 0):
- 1969, 500cc, linto: points=15, wins=1
- 1971, 500cc, linto: points=29, wins=1
- 1971, 500cc, mv agusta: points=29, wins=1
- 1972, 500cc, mv agusta: points=87, wins=1

2) Average points per win across only seasons where he had at least one win (per-row points divided by wins, then averaged)
SQL executed:
SELECT year, class, team, points, wins, (points::float / wins) AS points_per_win
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE wins > 0;

SELECT AVG(points::float / wins) AS average_points_per_win
FROM public.alberto_pagani
WHERE wins > 0;
Result: average_points_per_win = 40.00

3) Career-wide points per win (total points divided by total wins across all rows)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(points) AS total_points, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Result: total_points = 270, total_wins = 4

SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(points) / NULLIF(SUM(wins), 0) AS average_points_per_win FROM public.alberto_pagani;
Result: average_points_per_win = 67.5

Assessment
- If “average points in races he won” is interpreted as the average of (season points / season wins) computed only for rows where he recorded at least one win, the data yields exactly 40.00. Under this interpretation, the claim is supported.
- If interpreted as total career points divided by total career wins (a more global average), the result is 67.5, not 40.
- The table is at season/class/team granularity; it does not provide race-level point breakdowns, so we cannot compute literal race-level “points in the races he won.”

Conclusion
- The figure 40 is correct under the winning-seasons average-of-per-row points-per-win interpretation, but alternative reasonable interpretations produce a different value (67.5). Therefore, the claim is only partly verified by the available data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the phrase “average … in race he win” as: take each season/class/team row with wins > 0, compute (points/wins) for that row, then average these values across such rows.
- Treated the provided table as authoritative and complete for Alberto Pagani’s results.
