Claim to verify: "konqueror support only vp8 (webm) 4.4 , but not vp9 (webm)".

Evidence consulted: public.html5_video table (Database: TabFact), which tracks browser support for various video codecs.

Key evidence and executed SQL:
1) Query: Retrieve any rows for Konqueror and inspect WebM codec support.
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.html5_video WHERE LOWER(browser) LIKE '%konqueror%'
Result:
- browser: konqueror
- operating system: all supported
- latest stable release: 4.11.2 (1 October 2013)
- theora: 4.4
- h264: 4.4
- vp8 (webm): 4.4
- vp9 (webm): no

Assessment:
- The table indicates that Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) starting with version 4.4, and does not support VP9 (WebM) (listed as "no").
- The wording "only vp8 (webm)" is consistent with the data when interpreted as "within the WebM family, only VP8 is supported (not VP9)." Note that the same row shows Theora and H.264 support since 4.4 as well, but those are not WebM codecs and do not contradict the claim about WebM support.

Conclusion: The data supports the claim that Konqueror supports VP8 (WebM) (since 4.4) and does not support VP9 (WebM).

Assumptions:
- "only vp8 (webm)" is interpreted as "only VP8 among the WebM codecs is supported," not that VP8 is the only codec supported overall.
