Summary
Claim: “the total number of draw for bridgenorth be 0.”
Conclusion: Supported by the data; Bridgenorth has 0 draws.

Data Source Exploration
- Discovered data sources: A public PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.my_info_table.
- Schema (relevant columns):
  - "ntfa div 1" (text)
  - wins (bigint)
  - byes (bigint)
  - losses (bigint)
  - draws (bigint)
  - against (bigint)

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Retrieve Bridgenorth row to inspect draws and related stats
Executed SQL:
SELECT wins, byes, losses, draws, against FROM my_info_table WHERE "ntfa div 1" ILIKE 'Bridgenorth' OR "ntfa div 1" ILIKE 'Bridgnorth';
Result:
- Wins: 15
- Byes: 0
- Losses: 3
- Draws: 0
- Against: 1247

2) Aggregate check of total draws for all entries named Bridgenorth/Bridgnorth
Executed SQL:
SELECT SUM(draws) AS total_draws 
FROM my_info_table 
WHERE "ntfa div 1" IN ('Bridgenorth', 'Bridgnorth');
Result:
- total_draws: 0

Assessment
- Both the direct row lookup and the aggregate sum confirm draws = 0 for Bridgenorth/Bridgnorth.

Assumptions
- “bridgenorth” refers to the team entry whose name appears in the "ntfa div 1" column as either 'Bridgenorth' or 'Bridgnorth'.
- “total number of draw” refers to the value in the draws column for that team (and, if multiple rows existed, their sum).
