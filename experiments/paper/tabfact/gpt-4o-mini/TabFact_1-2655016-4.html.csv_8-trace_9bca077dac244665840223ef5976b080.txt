Summary of approach
- Explored available data sources and identified a single table with episode titles.
- Verified whether every episode title contains at least one alphabetic character (A–Z), treating this as the intended meaning of “have letter somewhere within the title.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public."list_of_all_that_episodes"
- Columns: season (bigint), series (bigint), "episode title" (text), "original air date" (text), "nick prod" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Count all episodes
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_episodes FROM public."list_of_all_that_episodes";
Result: 18

2) Count titles that are NULL, empty, or contain no alphabetic letters
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS invalid_titles_count FROM public."list_of_all_that_episodes" WHERE "episode title" IS NULL OR "episode title" = '' OR NOT "episode title" ~ '[A-Za-z]';
Result: 2

3) Examples of titles that contain no alphabetic letters
SQL:
SELECT season, series, "episode title" FROM public."list_of_all_that_episodes" WHERE "episode title" IS NULL OR "episode title" = '' OR NOT "episode title" ~ '[A-Za-z]' LIMIT 50;
Results (subset up to 50):
- Season: 8, Series: 45, Episode Title: 702
- Season: 11, Series: 48, Episode Title: 112

Conclusion
- Not all episode titles contain an alphabetic letter. 2 out of 18 titles have no letters, so the claim that “each of the episode title have letter somewhere within the title” is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “letter” to mean any alphabetic character (A–Z, case-insensitive), not the literal substring “letter.”
