Conclusion: Verified based on the 1997 Oakland Raiders season data. In Week 11, the opponent was the New Orleans Saints, and there were no earlier games that season against the Saints.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Validate table structure (to understand available fields)
- Result: Columns are week, attendance, date, opponent, result, tv time.
- SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 't_1997_oakland_raiders_season';

2) Identify Week 11 opponent
- Result: Week 11 opponent = New Orleans Saints; date = November 9, 1997; result = loss 13–10.
- SQL executed:
SELECT opponent, date, result FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week = 11;

3) Check if the Saints were faced earlier in the season (weeks < 11)
- Result: No rows returned; the Raiders did not face the Saints prior to Week 11 in 1997.
- SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1997_oakland_raiders_season WHERE week < 11 AND opponent ILIKE '%Saints%';

Assumptions:
- "for the first time" is interpreted as the first meeting between the 1997 Oakland Raiders and the New Orleans Saints within the 1997 season (not franchise history).
