Claim to verify:
“In Season 1 of Gary Unmarried, the least viewed episode of the season is the finale, which aired on May 20, 2009.”

Data source discovery and schema:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with table: public.gary_unmarried
- Table columns:
  - episode (text)
  - air date (text)
  - timeslot (text)
  - 18 - 49 (text)
  - viewers (double precision)

Step 1: Inspect sample records to understand data values
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM gary_unmarried LIMIT 10;
Key observations from returned rows:
- Air dates are stored as text in the form “september 24 , 2008”, etc.
- Viewers is a numeric field (in millions).
- Sample includes Season 1 episode entries from 2008 and 2009.

Step 2: Retrieve all Season 1 episodes (aired on or before May 20, 2009), ordered by air date, with their viewers
Executed SQL:
SELECT episode, "air date" AS original_air_date, viewers
FROM gary_unmarried
WHERE TO_DATE("air date", 'Month DD, YYYY') <= '2009-05-20'
ORDER BY TO_DATE("air date", 'Month DD, YYYY');

Relevant returned rows (abridged to essential points):
- ...
- gary and his half brother — may 6 , 2009 — viewers: 6.66
- gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal — may 20 , 2009 — viewers: 5.55

From the full returned list (Sept 24, 2008 through May 20, 2009), the viewers values are: 6.84, 6.97, 7.43, 7.71, 7.85, 6.44, 6.71, 8.14, 7.72, 8.03, 7.55, 7.07, 7.07, 6.86, 7.26, 7.71, 7.57, 7.30, 6.66, 5.55. The minimum is 5.55 million for the episode on May 20, 2009, which is the season finale (“Gary Fixes Allison’s Garbage Disposal”).

Findings:
- Finale air date: The data shows the finale aired on May 20, 2009.
- Least viewed episode of Season 1: Among all Season 1 episodes (air dates up to and including May 20, 2009), the lowest viewership is 5.55 million, which corresponds to the finale. No other Season 1 episode in the returned list has fewer viewers.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data: the Season 1 finale of Gary Unmarried aired on May 20, 2009 and had the lowest viewership of the season.

Assumptions:
- Season 1 is defined as episodes with air dates from September 2008 up to and including May 20, 2009, as per the dataset.
- “Viewers” represents total viewers in millions, as indicated by the numeric values in the viewers column.
