Claim: For the class 'vesuvius' with wheel arrangement '2 - 4 - 0', the quantity made is 32 and the quantity preserved is 0.

Data source explored: public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway (columns: class, wheel arrangement, manufacturer, year made, quantity made, quantity preserved, year (s) withdrawn; all text columns).

Evidence gathered:
- Query 1 (discovery of relevant row):
  SQL: SELECT "class", "wheel arrangement", "quantity made", "quantity preserved" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE LOWER("class") LIKE '%vesuvius%';
  Result: class = vesuvius; wheel arrangement = 2 - 4 - 0; quantity made = 32; quantity preserved = 0.

- Query 2 (exact match confirmation):
  SQL: SELECT "class", "wheel arrangement", "quantity made", "quantity preserved" FROM public.locomotives_of_the_southern_railway WHERE "class" = 'vesuvius' AND "wheel arrangement" = '2 - 4 - 0';
  Result: class = vesuvius; wheel arrangement = 2 - 4 - 0; quantity made = 32; quantity preserved = 0.

Conclusion: The data explicitly supports that for class 'vesuvius' with wheel arrangement '2 - 4 - 0', quantity made is 32 and quantity preserved is 0.

Assumptions: None beyond exact string matching of class and wheel arrangement as stored in the dataset.
