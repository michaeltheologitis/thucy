Claim interpreted: The user asks whether the result for incumbent Cecil R. King in “district California 10” was “Re-elected.” I verified this against the available 1942 U.S. House election dataset.

Data source explored
- Database: PostgreSQL
- Table: united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942
  Columns: district (text), incumbent (text), party (text), "first elected" (text), result (text), candidates (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Identify any entries for an incumbent named King
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE incumbent ILIKE '%King%';
Result:
- District: California 17; Incumbent: Cecil R. King

2) Retrieve full details for Cecil R. King
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE incumbent = 'Cecil R. King' OR incumbent ILIKE '%Cecil%King%';
Result:
- District: California 17
- Incumbent: Cecil R. King
- Party: Democratic
- First Elected: August 25, 1942
- Result: Re-elected
- Candidates: Cecil R. King (D) unopposed

3) Check for any entry labeled “California 10”
SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, result, candidates FROM united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1942 WHERE district ILIKE '%California 10%';
Result: No rows returned (no evidence in this dataset of “California 10” associated with Cecil R. King).

Conclusion
- The dataset shows Cecil R. King as the incumbent for California 17 in 1942, with the result “Re-elected” (unopposed).
- There is no evidence in this dataset that associates Cecil R. King with “California 10.”

Therefore: The “re-elected” outcome for Cecil R. King is supported, but the district given as “California 10” is not supported by the data (the correct district here is California 17).

Assumptions
- Interpreted the query as referring to the 1942 U.S. House elections (scope of the available dataset) and that “be re-elect” refers to the Result field.
- Interpreted “district california 10” as California’s 10th congressional district label in the dataset.
