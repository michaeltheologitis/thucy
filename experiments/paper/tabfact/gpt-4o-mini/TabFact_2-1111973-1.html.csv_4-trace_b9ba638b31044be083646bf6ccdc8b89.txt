the vcpc and vcrt of 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun be the same for vctp 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon , and so be the vcpc and vcrt of 75 km / h (47 mph) for vctp 75 km / h (47 mph)

Claim interpreted: The VCPC and VCRT variants are armed with a 7.62 mm (0.3 in) FN MAG 60-20 machine gun, the VCTP is armed with a 20 mm (0.79 in) Rh-202 autocannon, and the VCPC, VCRT, and VCTP all have a top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).

Evidence from the data source:
- Data source discovery: A PostgreSQL database with a table public.tam_tank containing text fields for TAM family variants (vctp, vca 155, vctm, vcpc, vclc, vcrt).

Executed SQL and results:
1) Query to inspect all available information
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.tam_tank;
Result (relevant excerpts summarized by variant):
- VCPC: 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60 - 20 machine gun; 75 km / h (47 mph)
- VCRT: 7.62 mm (0.3in) FN MAG 60 - 20 machine gun; 75 km / h (47 mph)
- VCTP: 20 mm (79in) RH - 202 autocannon; 75 km / h (47 mph)
- Additional speeds shown in table for other variants for context: VCA 155: 55 km/h; VCLC: 75 km/h; VCTM: 75 km/h

2) Focused query to read the VCPC, VCRT, and VCTP fields verbatim
SQL:
SELECT vcpc, vcrt, vctp FROM public.tam_tank;
Result (verbatim contents):
- vcpc: 25t (27.6tons), 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun, 28.8hp / t (25.1hp / ton), 75 km / h (47 mph)
- vcrt: 32t (35.3tons), 7.62 mm (0.3in) fn mag 60 - 20 machine gun, 22.5hp / t (20.4hp / ton), 75 km / h (47 mph)
- vctp: 28.2 t (31.1 tons), 20 mm (79in) rh - 202 autocannon, km (mi), 24hp / t (23hp / ton), 75 km / h (47 mph)

Assessment of sub-claims against the data:
- Armament: Supported. VCPC and VCRT are listed with a 7.62 mm FN MAG MG; VCTP is listed with a 20 mm Rh-202 autocannon.
- Top speed: Supported. VCPC, VCRT, and VCTP each show 75 km/h (47 mph).

Conclusion: The data directly supports the stated armaments for VCPC/VCRT versus VCTP, and confirms that all three have the same top speed of 75 km/h (47 mph).

Assumptions made due to wording ambiguity:
- Interpreted “be the same” to mean “match the official specs for each variant” rather than “all variants have the same armament,” because the claim itself cites different weapons (7.62 mm MG vs 20 mm autocannon) by variant.
