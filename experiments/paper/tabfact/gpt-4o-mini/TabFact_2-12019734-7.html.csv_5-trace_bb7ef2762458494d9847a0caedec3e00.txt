Claim: "when new jersey be the visitor on february 27, the score be 2 - 6"

Data sources explored
- Available data sources: A single PostgreSQL database with one table in the public schema: public.my_info_table.
- Table schema (public.my_info_table):
  - date (text)
  - visitor (text)
  - score (text)
  - home (text)
  - record (text)

Method
- Searched for all rows where the visitor contains "New Jersey" and the date corresponds to February 27, using multiple common date string patterns.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Primary search (full month name)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' 
  AND date ILIKE '%February 27%';
- Result:
  - date: February 27; visitor: New Jersey; home: Buffalo; score: 2 - 6; record: 12 - 39 - 13

2) Additional check (abbreviated month)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE visitor ILIKE '%New Jersey%' 
  AND date ILIKE '%Feb 27%';
- Result: No rows returned.

3) Additional check (numeric pattern yyyy-mm-dd)
- SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, home, score, record 
  FROM public.my_info_table 
  WHERE (visitor = 'New Jersey' OR visitor = 'New Jersey Devils') 
  AND date LIKE '%-02-27';
- Result: No rows returned.

Assessment
- The dataset contains a game entry with visitor = New Jersey on February 27 where the score is 2 - 6. This directly supports the claim.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions
- "New Jersey" refers to the New Jersey Devils (NHL) as represented in the dataset.
- The dataset stores some dates with the full month name (e.g., "February 27") without specifying the year.
- The claim pertains to whether such an occurrence exists in the dataset, not to a specific year or opponent.
