Claim to verify: "every team have several win"

Data sources discovered:
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: c_sar_ramos (columns: season, series, team, races, wins, poles, f / laps, podiums, points, position)

Evidence gathered:
1) Distinct teams and min/max total wins per team (wins summed across all rows per team)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT team) AS distinct_teams FROM public.c_sar_ramos;

  SELECT MIN(total_wins) AS min_total_wins, MAX(total_wins) AS max_total_wins FROM (SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins FROM public.c_sar_ramos GROUP BY team) AS team_wins;
- Result:
  - Distinct teams: 4
  - Minimum total wins across teams: 0
  - Maximum total wins across teams: 4

2) Teams with their total wins (sum across all seasons/series)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT team, SUM(wins) AS total_wins
  FROM public.c_sar_ramos
  GROUP BY team
  ORDER BY total_wins ASC;
- Result:
  - Manor Motorsport: 0 wins
  - S Fortec Motorsport: 0 wins
  - BVM - Target Racing: 3 wins
  - BVM Minardi Team: 4 wins

Assessment:
- At least two teams (Manor Motorsport and S Fortec Motorsport) have 0 total wins in the dataset. Therefore, the statement that every team has “several” wins is not supported. Even under the most lenient interpretation where “several” could mean at least one, the claim fails because some teams have zero wins. Under a typical interpretation of “several” as two or more, the claim also fails.

Conclusion: The data contradicts the claim.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to total wins per team across all records in the c_sar_ramos table.
- Considered “several” to mean at least two wins; however, the claim is still false even if interpreted as at least one win, since some teams have zero.
