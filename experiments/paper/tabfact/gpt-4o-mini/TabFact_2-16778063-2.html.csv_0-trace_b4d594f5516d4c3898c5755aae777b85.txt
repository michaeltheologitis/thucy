Summary
- Interpreted claim: “Week 12 be on December 2, 2001.” I verified this against the available data for the 2001 Cincinnati Bengals NFL season.

Data source exploration
- Available database: PostgreSQL
- Table: public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season
- Columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), attendance (bigint)

Evidence
- Finding: The row for Week 12 shows the date as December 2, 2001.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT week, date FROM public.t_2001_cincinnati_bengals_season WHERE week = 12;
- Result excerpt:
  week = 12, date = "December 2, 2001"

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data: in the 2001 Cincinnati Bengals season, Week 12 fell on December 2, 2001.

Assumptions
- Assumed “week 12” refers to NFL regular-season Week 12 and evaluated it using the available dataset (2001 Cincinnati Bengals). While this validates the date for the Bengals’ Week 12, broader league-wide context was not directly queried due to data availability, though NFL Week 12 that year also aligns with early December.
