Claim to verify: “November 7, 2003 is the air date of the episode titled ‘Boardroom and a Parked Place.’”

What I checked:
- Searched the available TV-episodes data (public database) for an episode titled “Boardroom and a Parked Place.”
- Retrieved the full row to confirm its recorded original air date.

Findings from the data:
- The database contains an episode titled “Boardroom and a Parked Place” attributed to Will & Grace, with these details:
  - Series: 98
  - Season: 6
  - Title: boardroom and a parked place
  - Directed By: james burrows
  - Written By: gail lerner
  - Original Air Date: november 7, 2002
  - US Viewers (millions): 21.1

This shows the air date is November 7, 2002 — not November 7, 2003.

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) To find the episode by title
SELECT series, season, title, "original air date" 
FROM will_grace_season_5 
WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('Boardroom and a Parked Place');

2) To retrieve the full row of the episode
SELECT * FROM public.will_grace_season_5 WHERE LOWER(title) = LOWER('Boardroom and a Parked Place');

Conclusion:
- The claim that the episode aired on November 7, 2003 is contradicted by the data. The recorded air date is November 7, 2002.

Assumptions:
- The episode title “Boardroom and a Parked Place” refers to the entry found in the available dataset (Will & Grace). The provided database is treated as authoritative per the instructions.
