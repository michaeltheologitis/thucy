Claim to verify: “Collingwood have a home team score that is 3 times higher than that of Geelong.”

Data source consulted: TabFact database, table public.t_1954_vfl_season (1954 VFL match data; scores stored as text in format goals.behinds (total)).

Step 1: Confirm relevant teams exist as home teams
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT "home team" FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season ORDER BY "home team" ASC;
- Result (excerpt):
  carlton; collingwood; geelong; north melbourne; richmond; st kilda

Step 2: Retrieve Collingwood home match(es)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
  WHERE "home team" = 'collingwood';
- Result:
  Date: 14 August 1954; Home Team: Collingwood; Home Team Score: 12.16 (88); Away Team: South Melbourne; Away Team Score: 13.12 (90); Venue: Victoria Park

Step 3: Retrieve Geelong home match(es)
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, "home team", "home team score", "away team", "away team score", venue 
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season 
  WHERE "home team" = 'geelong';
- Result:
  Date: 14 August 1954; Home Team: Geelong; Home Team Score: 13.12 (90); Away Team: Hawthorn; Away Team Score: 7.6 (48); Venue: Kardinia Park

Step 4: Extract total points for direct comparison
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "home team", "home team score", 
         CAST(SUBSTRING("home team score" FROM '\\((\\d+)\\)') AS INTEGER) AS numeric_total_points
  FROM public.t_1954_vfl_season
  WHERE "home team" IN ('collingwood', 'geelong');
- Result:
  • Geelong — 13.12 (90) → 90 points
  • Collingwood — 12.16 (88) → 88 points

Assessment
- Collingwood’s home score in the available data is 88; Geelong’s is 90. 88 is not three times as high as 90 (88/90 ≈ 0.98). There is no evidence in the dataset that Collingwood has a home team score three times Geelong’s home team score.

Conclusion: The claim is contradicted by the available data.

Assumptions and scope notes
- “Three times higher” is interpreted as “three times as high.”
- Verification is performed against the available public.t_1954_vfl_season data, which appears to cover a single round dated 14 August 1954 (one home entry each for Collingwood and Geelong). The dataset is treated as authoritative within its scope, per the grounding instructions.
- “Home team score” is taken as the total points in parentheses in the score string (e.g., 12.16 (88) → 88).
