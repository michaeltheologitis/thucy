Claim interpreted: “46 be the value of blank end when stolen end be 7.” Interpreting this within the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier dataset as: when the column "stolen ends" equals 7, the column "blank ends" equals 46.

Data source discovery
- Confirmed a single table exists: public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier with relevant columns including "blank ends" and "stolen ends".

Evidence
1) Listing available tables and columns
SQL:
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

SELECT column_name, data_type, table_name FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public';
Result summary:
- Table: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
- Columns include: "blank ends" (bigint), "stolen ends" (bigint), w, l, pf, pa, "ends won", "ends lost", "shot pct", skip, locale.

2) Retrieve rows where stolen ends = 7
SQL:
SELECT skip, locale, "blank ends", "stolen ends"
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "stolen ends" = 7;
Result:
- Skip: Wayne Middaugh; Locale: Ontario; Blank Ends: 10; Stolen Ends: 7

3) Count rows where stolen ends = 7 and show full row
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "stolen ends" = 7;

SELECT *
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "stolen ends" = 7 AND "blank ends" IS NOT NULL;
Result:
- total_rows = 1
- For that row: Blank Ends = 10; Ends Lost = 46; Ends Won = 42; Losses = 5; Points For = 75; Points Against = 62; Shot Percentage = 82%; Skip = Wayne Middaugh; Locale = Ontario

4) Check if any row has blank ends = 46
SQL:
SELECT skip, locale, "blank ends", "stolen ends", "ends won", "ends lost"
FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
WHERE "blank ends" = 46;
Result:
- No rows returned

Assessment
- When "stolen ends" = 7, the dataset shows "blank ends" = 10, not 46.
- No team or entry has "blank ends" = 46 anywhere in the table. The value 46 appears as "ends lost" for the same row where stolen ends = 7, which may be the source of confusion.

Conclusion: The claim that blank ends equals 46 when stolen ends equals 7 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “blank end” refers to the column "blank ends" and “stolen end” refers to "stolen ends" in the table public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier.
- The statement pertains to the same row (i.e., same team/entry) within this dataset.
