Summary of approach
- Discovered an accessible PostgreSQL data source with a table for the 1962 VFL season.
- Queried the season table to retrieve the match played on 1962-06-23, which includes the Collingwood vs Fitzroy fixture.
- Compared the recorded total points for both teams to assess the claim.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve matches on 1962-06-23 (returned the Collingwood vs Fitzroy match at Victoria Park)
Executed SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.t_1962_vfl_season WHERE date = '1962-06-23';

Returned data (as reported by the query tool):
- Date: 1962-06-23
- Venue: Victoria Park
- Home Team: Collingwood
- Home Team Score: 10.14 (74)
- Away Team: Fitzroy
- Away Team Score: 9.11 (65)
- Crowd: 26488

Analysis
- Collingwood total points: 74
- Fitzroy total points: 65
- Comparison: 74 > 65, so Collingwood scored more points than Fitzroy in this 1962 VFL match.

Conclusion
- The evidence shows that in the recorded 1962 VFL match between Collingwood and Fitzroy on 23 June 1962 at Victoria Park, Collingwood scored 74 points and Fitzroy scored 65 points. Therefore, the claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions and notes
- The claim refers to “their 1962 VFL match” in the singular; the verification used the identified Collingwood vs Fitzroy match on 1962-06-23. If there were multiple meetings between these teams in 1962, this verification specifically addresses the match evidenced above.
