- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season 
  WHERE LOWER(opponent) = 'port vale' 
  ORDER BY TO_DATE(date, 'DD Month YYYY') ASC;

3) Check whether matches occurred on the claimed dates (13 September 2008 and 28 March 2009)

  SELECT date, opponent, venue, result, attendance 
  FROM public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season 
  WHERE date = '13 September 2008' OR date = '28 March 2009';

Data source discovered:
- PostgreSQL database containing table public.t_2008_09_bradford_city_a_f_c_season with columns: game (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), venue (text), result (text), attendance (bigint).

Assessment:
- True: Bradford City and Port Vale faced each other twice in the 2008–09 season.
- False: The specific dates cited (13 September 2008 and 28 March 2009) do not match the database records; the actual dates were 6 September 2008 and 21 March 2009.

Assumptions:
- “go against” is interpreted as “played against.”
- The table represents Bradford City’s complete 2008–09 competitive fixtures/results, with dates stored as text in the format ‘DD Month YYYY’.
