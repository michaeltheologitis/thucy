Claim to verify: “Robert Bauman is the Democratic incumbent for Maryland District 7.”

Data sources discovered
- Connected authoritative data: PostgreSQL database TabFact, public schema, table united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 (columns: district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates).

Evidence
1) 1974 Maryland District 7 record
- Result found: Incumbent Parren Mitchell, Party: Democratic, Result: Re-elected, Candidates: “Parren Mitchell (D) unopposed.” This shows the Democratic incumbent for Maryland’s 7th district in 1974 was Parren Mitchell, not Robert Bauman.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
WHERE (district LIKE '%7%' OR incumbent LIKE '%Robert Bauman%');

2) 1974 record mentioning Robert Bauman
- Result found: District: Maryland 1, Incumbent: Robert Bauman, Party: Republican, First Elected: 1973, Result: Re-elected, Candidates: “Robert Bauman (R) 53.0%, Thomas J Hatem (D) 47.0%.” This shows Robert Bauman was a Republican incumbent for Maryland’s 1st district, not a Democratic incumbent for the 7th.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT district, incumbent, party, "first elected", result, candidates 
FROM public.united_states_house_of_representatives_elections_1974 
WHERE candidates ILIKE '%Robert Bauman%';

Conclusion
- The available authoritative data directly contradicts the claim. In 1974, Robert Bauman was a Republican incumbent in Maryland’s 1st district, and the Democratic incumbent for Maryland’s 7th district was Parren Mitchell.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “Maryland district 7” as the U.S. House of Representatives Maryland 7th congressional district. The connected data source covers the 1974 election cycle; conclusions are based on that authoritative dataset.
