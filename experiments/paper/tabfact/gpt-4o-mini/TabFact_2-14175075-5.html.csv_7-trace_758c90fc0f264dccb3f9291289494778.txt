Claim to verify: “softball be the sport with the second latest date.”

Conclusion: The data show Softball has the latest (most recent) date among all sports, not the second latest. The second latest is Women’s Gymnastics. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Evidence and executed SQL:

1) Confirm table structure (so we can correctly parse dates)
- Result: Table public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series has columns: date (text), site (text), sport (text), winning team (text), series (text).
- Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 'iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series';

2) Inspect date format (to choose correct parsing)
- Sample distinct date values include: “September 9, 2007”, “November 10, 2007”, “April 1, 2008”. We must parse text dates to proper dates before comparing.
- Executed SQL:
select distinct date from public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series order by date desc limit 20;

3) Compute the latest date per sport using proper date parsing
- Result (ordered by latest_date desc):
  1. softball — 2008-04-01
  2. w gymnastics — 2008-03-07
  3. wrestling — 2007-12-09
  4. m basketball — 2007-12-08
  5. w swimming — 2007-12-07
  6. w basketball — 2007-12-05
  7. w cross country — 2007-11-10
  7. m cross country — 2007-11-10
  9. football — 2007-09-15
  10. w soccer — 2007-09-09
  11. volleyball — 2007-09-08
  12. m golf — 2007-09-04
- Executed SQL:
SELECT sport, MAX(to_date(date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS latest_date 
FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series 
GROUP BY sport 
ORDER BY latest_date DESC;

4) Rank sports by their latest date (descending)
- Result: Softball has rank 1 (most recent); Women’s Gymnastics has rank 2 (second most recent).
- Executed SQL:
WITH latest_dates AS (
    SELECT sport, MAX(to_date(date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS latest_date
    FROM public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series
    GROUP BY sport
)
SELECT sport, latest_date, DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY latest_date DESC) AS rank
FROM latest_dates
ORDER BY rank ASC;

Assessment: The evidence shows Softball is ranked first by latest date, not second. Thus, the claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions:
- “Second latest date” is interpreted as the second-most recent maximum event date per sport within the table public.iowa_corn_cy_hawk_series.
- The text dates are correctly parsed with to_date(date, 'FMMonth DD, YYYY').
