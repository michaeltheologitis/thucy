Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Amy Sherman-Palladino directed 4 episodes in 2003 (assumed to refer to Gilmore Girls episodes aired in 2003).

Data sources discovered
- Available database: public schema
- Relevant table: public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes (Gilmore Girls episode data)

Relevant table schema (from schema introspection)
- Columns: no (bigint), - (bigint), title (text), director (text), writer (s) (text), original air date (text), prod code (bigint), us viewers (million) (double precision)
- Note: director and original air date are text; dates are stored as strings (e.g., contain "2003"). Director names may include spaces around hyphens (e.g., "Amy Sherman - Palladino").

Evidence and executed SQL
1) List all 2003-airing episodes to inspect directors
SQL:
SELECT title, director, "original air date" 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE "original air date" LIKE '%2003%';
Result (excerpt demonstrating relevance):
- Ballrooms and Biscotti | Amy Sherman - Palladino | September 23, 2003
- (Other 2003 episodes had directors Chris Long, Matthew Diamond, Neema Barnette, Tom Moore, Jamie Babbit, etc.)

2) Robust count of 2003 episodes directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino (accounting for formatting variations)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy%' 
  AND director ILIKE '%Palladino%'
  AND "original air date" LIKE '%2003%';
Result: 1

3) List the specific 2003 episode(s) directed by Amy Sherman-Palladino
SQL:
SELECT title, "original air date" 
FROM public.list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes 
WHERE director ILIKE '%Amy%'
  AND director ILIKE '%Palladino%'
  AND "original air date" LIKE '%2003%';
Result:
- Ballrooms and Biscotti | September 23, 2003

Conclusion
- The data show Amy Sherman-Palladino directed 1 Gilmore Girls episode that aired in 2003, not 4.

Assumptions
- "episode in 2003" refers to Gilmore Girls episodes with "original air date" containing 2003 in the provided table.
- Director matching uses substring checks for both "Amy" and "Palladino" to accommodate formatting variants (e.g., hyphenation/spaces) present in the data.
