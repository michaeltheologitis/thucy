Claim to verify: "in the 2006 season the texas mariner play the angel 9 time"

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (public schema) with a single table: t_2006_texas_rangers_season (Texas Rangers 2006 season games).

Relevant schema (as reported by the schema tool)
- Table: t_2006_texas_rangers_season
  - date (text): Date of the game
  - opponent (text): Opponent team name
  - score (text): Final score of the game
  - loss (text): Indicator of loss in game (Y/N)
  - attendance (bigint): Number of attendees
  - record (text): Team's record at the time of game

Evidence 1: Count of games by opponent
- Result (from the database):
  - [ angels ]: 7
  - [ athletics ]: 3
  - [ indians ]: 6
  - [ mariners ]: 9
  - [ tigers ]: 2
- Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, COUNT(*) AS games_played
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season
GROUP BY opponent
ORDER BY games_played DESC;

Evidence 2: All games vs opponents containing 'Angel'
- Result (from the database): 7 games listed (all in September) vs "Angels" with dates and scores.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponent, score 
FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season 
WHERE opponent ILIKE '%Angel%';

Assessment
- Interpreting the claim as referring to the Texas Rangers (the available 2006 dataset) versus the Angels, the database shows 7 games against the Angels, not 9.
- The same dataset shows 9 games against the Mariners, which may have prompted the confusion, but that does not support the specific claim about games against the Angels.

Conclusion
- The claim that they played the Angels 9 times is not supported by the available 2006 Texas Rangers game data; the data shows 7 games against the Angels.

Assumptions made
- "texas mariner" is interpreted as the Texas Rangers, and "angel" refers to the Los Angeles Angels.
- Verification is performed against the accessible 2006 Texas Rangers season dataset in this environment, which appears to include at least the September portion of the season.
