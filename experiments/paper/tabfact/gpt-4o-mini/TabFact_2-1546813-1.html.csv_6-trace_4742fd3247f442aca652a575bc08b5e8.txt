Claim to verify
- The US last won the Solheim Cup in 2009, which was one of 7 titles since 1990.

What the data shows
1) Last year the United States won (per available records)
- Result: 2009 is the most recent US win in the dataset.
- Evidence (list of winners by year):
  - 1990: United States
  - 1992: Europe
  - 1994: United States
  - 1996: United States
  - 1998: United States
  - 2000: Europe
  - 2002: United States
  - 2003: Europe
  - 2005: United States
  - 2007: United States
  - 2009: United States
  - 2011: Europe
  - 2013: Europe
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT year, "winning team" FROM public.solheim_cup ORDER BY year ASC;

2) How many US titles since 1990
- Result: 8 US titles in the dataset.
- Evidence A (grouping by winner):
  - United States: max_year = 2009, total_wins = 8
  - Europe: max_year = 2013, total_wins = 5
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "winning team", MAX(year) AS max_year, COUNT(*) AS total_wins 
  FROM solheim_cup 
  GROUP BY "winning team";

- Evidence B (string-match count for robustness):
  - Count of rows where winning team contains 'United States': 8
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.solheim_cup WHERE LOWER("winning team") LIKE '%united states%';

Assessment of each part of the claim
- "The US last won the Solheim Cup in 2009": Supported by the dataset (no US wins listed after 2009; 2011 and 2013 are Europe).
- "…which was one of 7 titles since 1990": Not supported; the dataset shows 8 US titles (1990, 1994, 1996, 1998, 2002, 2005, 2007, 2009).

Conclusion
- The claim mixes a correct statement about the last recorded US win (2009) with an incorrect count of total US titles (should be 8, not 7, based on the data).

Assumptions and scope
- Assumes the solheim_cup table is complete for the period it covers (1990–2013 as evidenced by the years returned). If the user intended to refer to results beyond 2013, those are outside the scope of the available dataset; this verification is strictly grounded in the accessible data.
