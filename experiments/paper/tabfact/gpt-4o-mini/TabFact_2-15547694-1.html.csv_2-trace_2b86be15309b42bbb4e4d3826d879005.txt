Interpretation of the claim:
- I interpret “group of origin” as the origin categories in the 5th Seanad dataset: the five vocational panels, the two university constituencies (National University of Ireland and University of Dublin), and “Nominated by the Taoiseach”.
- I interpret “made up entirely of members from 1 party” to mean that, for a given group of origin, all its members come from a single party label in the dataset’s party column.

Data source discovered:
- Available database: public schema with table members_of_the_5th_seanad. Columns include: party, administrative panel, agricultural panel, cultural and educational panel, industrial and commercial panel, labour panel, national university of ireland, university of dublin, nominated by the taoiseach, total.

Key evidence:
1) Distinct parties represented in each group of origin (excluding an aggregate “Total” row):
Executed SQL:
SELECT 'administrative panel' AS group_name, COUNT(DISTINCT party) AS party_count
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "administrative panel" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'agricultural panel', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "agricultural panel" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'cultural and educational panel', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "cultural and educational panel" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'industrial and commercial panel', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "industrial and commercial panel" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'labour panel', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "labour panel" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'national university of ireland', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "national university of ireland" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'university of dublin', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "university of dublin" > 0
UNION ALL
SELECT 'nominated by the taoiseach', COUNT(DISTINCT party)
FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad
WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "nominated by the taoiseach" > 0
ORDER BY group_name;

Result (party_count per group):
- Administrative Panel: 2
- Agricultural Panel: 4
- Cultural and Educational Panel: 2
- Industrial and Commercial Panel: 4
- Labour Panel: 2
- National University of Ireland: 3
- Nominated by the Taoiseach: 3
- University of Dublin: 1

This shows University of Dublin is the only group with exactly one party represented.

2) Which party represents the University of Dublin seats:
Executed SQL:
SELECT party, "university of dublin" AS ud_count FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "university of dublin" > 0 ORDER BY ud_count DESC, party;

Result:
- Party: Independent, University of Dublin Count: 3

A comprehensive listing of parties per group (confirming no other group is single-party):
Executed SQL:
WITH grp AS (
  SELECT 'administrative panel' AS group_name, party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "administrative panel" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'agricultural panel', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "agricultural panel" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'cultural and educational panel', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "cultural and educational panel" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'industrial and commercial panel', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "industrial and commercial panel" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'labour panel', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "labour panel" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'national university of ireland', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "national university of ireland" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'university of dublin', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "university of dublin" > 0
  UNION ALL
  SELECT 'nominated by the taoiseach', party FROM members_of_the_5th_seanad WHERE LOWER(party) <> 'total' AND "nominated by the taoiseach" > 0
)
SELECT group_name, ARRAY_AGG(DISTINCT party ORDER BY party) AS parties, COUNT(DISTINCT party) AS party_count
FROM grp
GROUP BY group_name
ORDER BY group_name;

Key excerpts from the result:
- Administrative Panel: Parties = [Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael]; party_count = 2
- Agricultural Panel: Parties = [Clann na Talmhan, Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independent]; party_count = 4
- Cultural and Educational Panel: Parties = [Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael]; party_count = 2
- Industrial and Commercial Panel: Parties = [Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independent, Labour Party]; party_count = 4
- Labour Panel: Parties = [Clann na Talmhan, Labour Party]; party_count = 2
- National University of Ireland: Parties = [Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Independent]; party_count = 3
- Nominated by the Taoiseach: Parties = [Fianna Fáil, Independent, Labour Party]; party_count = 3
- University of Dublin: Parties = [Independent]; party_count = 1

Conclusion:
- In the 5th Seanad dataset, University of Dublin is the only group of origin whose members all come from a single party label (Independent). All other origins have members from at least two party labels.

Assumptions made:
- Scope is the 5th Seanad data in the provided table. Other Seanad terms or bodies are not considered due to data availability.
- “Party” uses the dataset’s party labels; “Independent” is treated as a party label in this context.
- “Group of origin” corresponds to the columns representing panels, the two university constituencies, and Taoiseach nominations.
