Claim interpreted: “March is the month that aired the most episodes, with 5.” We verify this against the available Republic of Doyle episodes dataset.

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database with table public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes.

Relevant schema (from introspection)
- Table: public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
  - Columns: "Unnamed: 0" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "viewers" (bigint), "original airdate" (text), "prod code" (bigint)
  - Note: "original airdate" is stored as text like “january 6 , 2010”; it must be parsed to a date.

Evidence 1: Episodes per month across all records
Result summary: March has the highest count with 5 episodes; January has 3; February has 2.
Executed SQL:
SELECT EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(initcap(regexp_replace("original airdate", '\s+,\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) AS month_number,
       to_char(TO_DATE(initcap(regexp_replace("original airdate", '\s+,\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY'), 'Month') AS month_name,
       COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
GROUP BY month_number, month_name
ORDER BY episode_count DESC, month_number ASC;

Evidence 2: All March episodes and their count
Result summary: There are 5 March episodes: The Woman Who Knew Too Little (March 3, 2010), The Tell - Tale Safe (March 10, 2010), He Sleeps with the Chips (March 17, 2010), The Pen is Mightier than the Doyle (March 24, 2010), A Horse Divided (March 31, 2010).
Executed SQL (list):
SELECT title, TO_DATE(initcap(regexp_replace("original airdate", '\s+,\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY') AS parsed_date
FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(initcap(regexp_replace("original airdate", '\s+,\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) = 3;
Executed SQL (count):
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM list_of_republic_of_doyle_episodes
WHERE EXTRACT(MONTH FROM TO_DATE(initcap(regexp_replace("original airdate", '\s+,\s*', ', ')), 'FMMonth DD, YYYY')) = 3;

Conclusion
- The data shows March is the month with the most episodes aired, with a total of 5. This supports the claim.

Assumptions
- “Air the most episode with 5” is interpreted as: across all available records in this dataset, March has the highest number of episodes aired, with a count of 5.
- Dates are derived by parsing the text field "original airdate" into a proper date using the shown SQL transformation.
