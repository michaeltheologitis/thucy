Claim: “team brazil, team australia, and team england be 3 of the club that participate in the 2011 season.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public
- Relevant table: list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, football club, continent, associated football club, seasons, racing drivers)

Evidence 1: Identify all clubs whose seasons include 2011
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE seasons ILIKE '%2011%';
- Key returned rows (football club — seasons):
  - ac sparta prague — 2011
  - team luxembourg — 2011
  - team new zealand — 2011
  - team japan — 2011
  - rsc anderlecht — 2008 2009 2010 2011
  - team netherlands — 2011
  - team brazil — 2011
  - team australia — 2011
  - team england — 2011

Evidence 2: Direct verification for the three specified clubs with 2011
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "football club", seasons FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs WHERE "football club" IN ('team brazil', 'team australia', 'team england') AND seasons LIKE '%2011%';
- Returned rows:
  - team brazil — 2011
  - team australia — 2011
  - team england — 2011

Conclusion: The data show that “team brazil,” “team australia,” and “team england” each have 2011 listed in their seasons and appear among the clubs participating in 2011. Therefore, the claim is supported.

Assumptions made:
- “Participate in the 2011 season” is interpreted as the table’s seasons field containing the substring “2011.”
- “Club” corresponds to the table’s football club values exactly as listed (lowercase names as stored).
