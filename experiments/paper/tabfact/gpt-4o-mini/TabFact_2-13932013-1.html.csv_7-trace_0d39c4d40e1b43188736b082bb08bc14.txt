Claim to verify: "the cleveland brown have tie a total of 12 game"

Data source explored: public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks
- Relevant columns: quarterback, uniform no (s), games started, wins, losses, ties, winning pct
- The ties column records the number of tie games associated with each starting quarterback. Summing ties across all starting quarterbacks gives the franchise’s total ties in the scope of this dataset.

Evidence
1) Total franchise ties (sum over all starting quarterbacks)
SQL executed:
SELECT SUM(ties) AS total_ties FROM public.list_of_cleveland_browns_starting_quarterbacks;

Result: total_ties = 10

Assessment
- The claim states 12 ties, while the authoritative dataset reports 10 total ties. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the Cleveland Browns’ total number of tie games in franchise history as reflected in the available dataset.
- Assumed the table comprehensively covers the team’s regular-season ties (playoff ties do not occur in modern NFL rules).
