Conclusion
- The database shows exactly 8 games where the game site is recorded as “The Meadowlands.” This directly supports the claim.

Assumptions and notes
- Interpreted the claim as counting games where the textual field "game site" equals “The Meadowlands” (case-insensitive check used for completeness).
- The dataset also contains a separate site value “Giants Stadium” (1 game). This was not counted toward the 8, since the claim explicitly refers to the site name “The Meadowlands.”
