Conclusion
Based on the available 2007–08 Minnesota Wild game data in the connected database, Minnesota played 6 home games and 8 away games (total 14), meaning they played 2 fewer home games than away. Interpreting the claim as “two fewer” home games than away, the claim is supported by the data.

Evidence and Executed SQL
1) Data source and table
- Discovered data source: public schema with table t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season containing game-level rows for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season (columns: date, visitor, score, home, decision, attendance, record).

2) Identify the team label used in the table
- Distinct home team names
  SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT home FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
  Result (excerpt relevant to Minnesota): includes 'Minnesota'
- Distinct visitor team names
  SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT visitor FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
  Result (excerpt relevant to Minnesota): includes 'Minnesota'
(From these, the Minnesota Wild appear as 'Minnesota'.)

3) Total number of games in the dataset
  SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_games FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
  Result:
  total_games = 14

4) Count Minnesota home vs away games
  Because of potential whitespace/formatting inconsistencies, substring matching was used to robustly identify the team name.
  SQL:
  SELECT
    SUM(CASE WHEN home ILIKE '%Minnesota%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS home_games,
    SUM(CASE WHEN visitor ILIKE '%Minnesota%' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS away_games,
    COUNT(*) AS total_games
  FROM public.t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season;
  Results:
  home_games = 6
  away_games = 8
  total_games = 14

Assessment of the claim
- If “2 time less” is interpreted as “two fewer” (i.e., away_games = home_games + 2), the data shows 6 home vs 8 away, which matches exactly.
- If “2 time less” were interpreted as “two times less” (i.e., half as many home as away), that would imply a 1:2 ratio (e.g., 4 home vs 8 away), which is not supported (observed ratio is 6:8 = 0.75).

Final determination: Under the more natural interpretation of “two fewer,” the claim is supported by the database.

Assumptions
- “2 time less” is interpreted as “two fewer,” not “two times fewer.”
- The table t_2007_08_minnesota_wild_season is the authoritative dataset for the 2007–08 Minnesota Wild season within this data environment (no external data consulted, and no distinction made here between preseason/regular season/playoffs unless otherwise indicated in the dataset).
