Summary conclusion: Based on the available authoritative dataset, Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent on 4 April 2011 was Arnau Brugués-Davi, not Rik de Voest.

Data sources discovered:
- PostgreSQL database: TabFact
- Table: alex_bogdanovic (columns: date, tournament, surface, opponent in the final, score)

Key evidence from the data:
1) Direct lookup of entries in 2011
- Finding: A row exists for 4 April 2011 indicating Arnau Brugués-Davi as the opponent in the final.
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, tournament, "opponent in the final" AS opponent, score FROM alex_bogdanovic WHERE date LIKE '%2011%';
- Result row:
  date: 4 April 2011; tournament: Little Rock, AR, USA F9; opponent: Arnau Brugués - Davi; score: 3 - 6, 1 - 6

2) Check for any finals where the opponent was Rik de Voest (to see if the date was misattributed)
- Finding: Rik de Voest appears as the opponent in a different final dated 8 April 2013 (not 2011).
- SQL executed:
  SELECT date, tournament, "opponent in the final", score 
  FROM alex_bogdanovic 
  WHERE "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%Rik de Voest%' 
     OR "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%de Voest%' 
     OR "opponent in the final" ILIKE '%Rik%';
- Result row:
  date: 8 April 2013; tournament: Oklahoma City, USA F9; opponent: Rik de Voest; score: 3 - 6, 2 - 6

Conclusion: The dataset shows that on 4 April 2011, Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent in the final was Arnau Brugués-Davi, not Rik de Voest. Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as: “Rik de Voest was Alex Bogdanovic’s opponent on April 4, 2011.”
- The table alex_bogdanovic lists finals; thus “opponent” is taken to mean “opponent in the final” for that date (the only opponent field available).
