Claim: “gohad have 16732 more electorate in 2009 than bhander.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema
- Relevant table: public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency
- Relevant columns:
  - "name" (text)
  - "number of electorates (2009)" (bigint)

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) List constituency names and 2009 electorates to confirm availability of Gohad and Bhander, and their counts.
SQL:
SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency;
Result excerpt:
- Gohad — 166,893
- Bhander — 139,600

2) Direct retrieval for just Gohad and Bhander (for verification):
SQL:
SELECT name, "number of electorates (2009)" FROM public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency WHERE name IN ('Gohad', 'Bhander');
Result:
- Gohad — 166,893
- Bhander — 139,600

Calculation:
- Difference (Gohad − Bhander) = 166,893 − 139,600 = 27,293

Assessment:
- The claim states the difference is 16,732, but the data shows the difference is 27,293. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- “electorate in 2009” refers to the column "number of electorates (2009)" in public.bhind_lok_sabha_constituency.
- “Gohad” and “Bhander” refer to the constituency names exactly as stored in the table.
