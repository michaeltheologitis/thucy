Conclusion: The claim is supported by the data. In the 1989 U.S. Open Golf dataset, four players tied for 9th place, and three of them are from the United States.

Data source discovery:
- Available data source: a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf (1989 U.S. Open Golf results).

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Table schema confirmation
SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, character_maximum_length, is_nullable, column_default 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 't_1989_u_s_open_golf' AND table_schema = 'public';
Key columns: place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint).

2) Understand how ties are recorded in the place column
SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT place FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place;
Result (distinct values): 1, 5, 8, t2, t6, t9 (indicating ties with a leading 't').

3) Retrieve all entries tied for 9th place and inspect their countries
SQL:
SELECT player, country, score, "to par", money
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE place = 't9';
Result rows:
- Paul Azinger | United States | 71 + 72 + 70 + 70 = 283 | + 3 | 19,968
- Hubert Green | United States | 69 + 72 + 74 + 68 = 283 | + 3 | 19,968
- Tom Kite | United States | 67 + 69 + 69 + 78 = 283 | + 3 | 19,968
- José María Olazábal | Spain | 69 + 72 + 70 + 72 = 283 | + 3 | 19,968

4) Count breakdown by country among t9 finishers
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_count,
       country,
       COUNT(*) AS country_count
FROM public.t_1989_u_s_open_golf
WHERE place = 't9'
GROUP BY country;
Results:
- United States: country_count = 3 (total_count repeated per group)
- Spain: country_count = 1

Assessment:
- Total tied for 9th: 4
- From the United States: 3
This matches the claim that three of the people tied for ninth place are from the United States.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the 1989 U.S. Open Golf dataset and the phrase “united state” as “United States.”
- Interpreted “tie for ninth place” as rows where place = 't9' in the dataset.
