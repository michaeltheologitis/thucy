Claim to verify: “globular cluster have more apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy.”

Data sources explored
- Connected relational database with table public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 containing NGC objects and their apparent magnitudes.

Relevant schema
- Columns in public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000:
  - ngc number (bigint)
  - object type (text)
  - constellation (text)
  - right ascension ( j2000 ) (text)
  - declination ( j2000 ) (text)
  - apparent magnitude (double precision)

Evidence 1: Object types present and counts
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "object type", COUNT(*) AS count
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000
  GROUP BY "object type";
- Result (excerpt for relevant types):
  - Globular Cluster – 1
  - Irregular Galaxy – 2

Evidence 2: Actual entries and magnitudes for the two types
- SQL executed:
  SELECT "ngc number", "object type", "apparent magnitude" 
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 
  WHERE lower("object type") IN ('globular cluster', 'irregular galaxy') 
  ORDER BY "ngc number";
- Result:
  - NGC 5408 | Irregular Galaxy | 14.0
  - NGC 5466 | Globular Cluster | 10.5
  - NGC 5477 | Irregular Galaxy | 14.5

Evidence 3: Aggregated comparison of apparent magnitudes
- SQL executed:
  SELECT lower("object type") AS object_type, COUNT(*) AS n, ROUND(AVG("apparent magnitude")::numeric, 2) AS avg_mag, MIN("apparent magnitude") AS min_mag, MAX("apparent magnitude") AS max_mag 
  FROM public.list_of_ngc_objects_5001_6000 
  WHERE lower("object type") IN ('globular cluster','irregular galaxy') 
  GROUP BY lower("object type") 
  ORDER BY object_type;
- Result:
  - globular cluster: n=1, avg_mag=10.50, min=10.5, max=10.5
  - irregular galaxy: n=2, avg_mag=14.25, min=14.0, max=14.5

Assessment
- In this dataset, the single globular cluster has apparent magnitude 10.5, while the irregular galaxies have magnitudes 14.0 and 14.5. Numerically, 10.5 is less than 14.0–14.5. Therefore, globular cluster does not have a greater (i.e., higher numerical) apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy in the available data; it is brighter (lower magnitude number) than the irregular galaxies listed.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data available: globular cluster does not have more (higher numerical) apparent magnitude than irregular galaxy in this dataset.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “more apparent magnitude” as a larger numerical magnitude value.
- Used all available entries for the two object classes within the NGC 5001–6000 table (n=1 globular cluster, n=2 irregular galaxies).
