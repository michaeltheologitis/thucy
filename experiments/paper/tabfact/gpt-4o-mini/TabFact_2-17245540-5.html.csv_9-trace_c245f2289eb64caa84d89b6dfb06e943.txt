Scope and data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact (Schema: public)
- Relevant table: t_1973_u_s_open_golf with columns [place, player, country, score, to par]

Evidence collected
1) Check for Gene Borek in the 1973 U.S. Open Golf table
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%borek%';
- Result: place = t6; player = gene borek; country = united states; score = 77 + 65 = 142; to par = e

2) Check New Zealand players and whether any tied for 3rd (T3)
- SQL: SELECT place, player FROM t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE country = 'new zealand';
- Result: place = t3; player = Bob Charles
- SQL: SELECT * FROM t_1973_u_s_open_golf WHERE country = 'new zealand' AND place ILIKE '%t3%';
- Result: Bob Charles appears with place t3 (tied for 3rd)

3) Full-table context
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1973_u_s_open_golf ORDER BY place ASC;
- Relevant rows:
  - t3: Jack Nicklaus (United States), Johnny Miller (United States), Bob Charles (New Zealand)
  - t6: Gene Borek (United States)

Assessment of the claim
- Claim interpreted: “Gene Borek from New Zealand tied for 3rd place.”
- Findings contradict the claim on two counts:
  - Nationality: Gene Borek is listed as from the United States, not New Zealand.
  - Placement: Gene Borek’s place is t6 (tied for 6th), not t3 (tied for 3rd).
- A New Zealand player who tied for 3rd is Bob Charles, not Gene Borek.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data in the available table.

Assumptions made
- The phrase “tie for 3rd place” corresponds to place value “t3” in the t_1973_u_s_open_golf table.
- The user’s claim pertains to the 1973 U.S. Open Golf results represented by the discovered table.
