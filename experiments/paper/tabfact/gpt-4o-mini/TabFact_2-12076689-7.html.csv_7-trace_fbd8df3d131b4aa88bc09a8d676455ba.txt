Summary of available data sources
- Discovered data sources show a single table in the public schema: t_2006_texas_rangers_season. No 2007-season tables are available.

Schema details consulted
- Table: t_2006_texas_rangers_season
  - Columns: date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

Evidence queries and results
1) Identify which seasons/years are represented in the available table
- Purpose: Determine if any 2007 data exists.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING(date, 1, 4) AS year FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season;
- Result summary: Returned values like 'sept' and 'octo', indicating the date field begins with month text and does not encode the year at the start.

2) Attempt to extract a 4-digit year from the end of the date field
- Purpose: Double-check if the year appears at the end of the date strings.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT DISTINCT SUBSTRING(date FROM '\\d{4}$') AS year FROM public.t_2006_texas_rangers_season;
- Result summary: Returned NULL for all rows, indicating the date strings in this table do not include a 4-digit year. The table name itself indicates 2006, and no 2007 table is present.

3) List all tables in the public schema to confirm lack of 2007 data
- Purpose: Verify that there are no tables for a 2007 season available.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
- Result summary: Only one table listed: t_2006_texas_rangers_season.

4) (Context-only) Check for any 8-3 final scores in the available table (2006)
- Purpose: Understand the score formatting and confirm that an 8-3 score format appears in the data we do have (note: this is 2006, not 2007, so it does not address the user’s claim but helps interpret the score field).
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, score FROM t_2006_texas_rangers_season WHERE score = '8-3' OR score = '8 - 3';
- Result summary: Found an 8 - 3 game on Date: September 25 vs. Angels (2006 dataset). This does not inform 2007.

Conclusion
- The only accessible dataset is for the 2006 Texas Rangers season; there is no data for the 2007 season in the available sources. Therefore, the claim that the final game score was 8 - 3 in two different games of the 2007 season cannot be verified or supported with the provided data. It remains unsupported by the evidence available here.

Assumptions made
- "Final game score" refers to the final scoreline recorded in the score column.
- "2007 season" refers to games played in calendar year 2007 (or the 2007 MLB season). Since only a 2006 season table exists in the accessible data, no 2007 verification is possible without additional data tables for 2007.
