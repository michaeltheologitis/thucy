Scope and data source
- Explored available data sources and found a single authoritative table: public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball, which contains season-level data for VCU Rams men’s basketball (columns: year, record, seed, region, results).

Schema snapshot
- year (bigint): season year
- record (text): win-loss record string (e.g., 20-10)
- seed (bigint), region (text), results (text)

Evidence 1: Direct match on common 18-12 formats
- Question answered: What is the earliest year with a record of 18-12 (allowing for typical spacing around the dash), and which years have that record?
- Result: Earliest year = 1980; Years with that record = [1980]
- SQL executed (earliest year):
SELECT MIN(year) AS earliest_year
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
WHERE record = '18-12' OR record = '18 - 12' OR record = '18  - 12' OR record = '18- 12';
- SQL executed (list all years):
SELECT year
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
WHERE record = '18-12' OR record = '18 - 12' OR record = '18  - 12' OR record = '18- 12';

Evidence 2: Normalized match (robust to any non-digit separators)
- Question answered: Confirm earliest year when treating any run of non-digit characters (spaces, hyphens, en-dashes) as a single hyphen.
- Result: Earliest year = 1980; Matching row details: year=1980, record=18 - 12, seed=12, region=East, results=Lost 72 - 86
- SQL executed:
SELECT year, record, seed, region, results
FROM vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
WHERE regexp_replace(record, '[^0-9]+', '-', 'g') = '18-12'
ORDER BY year ASC;

Conclusion
- The data shows that the earliest season with a record of 18-12 is 1980. No earlier year in the dataset has that record, and 1980 is the only year matching 18-12.

Assumptions
- “Record of 18 - 12” refers to the overall season win-loss record as stored in the record column of the VCU Rams men’s basketball table.
- “Earliest year” refers to the minimum year value in this dataset where the record equals 18-12 (allowing for minor formatting variations of the dash).
