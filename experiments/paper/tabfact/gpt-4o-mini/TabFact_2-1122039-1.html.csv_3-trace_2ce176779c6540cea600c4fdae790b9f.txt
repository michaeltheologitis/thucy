Data sources explored
- Database: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix (columns: driver, entrant, constructor, chassis, engine, tyre)

Evidence
1) Retrieve all rows where entrant is Private (case-insensitive) and show driver and tyre
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT driver, entrant, tyre FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE LOWER(entrant) = 'private';
- Result:
  - Driver: Toni Branca, Tyre: P
  - Driver: Philippe Étancelin, Tyre: D

2) Count rows with entrant Private to confirm there are exactly two
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE LOWER(entrant) = 'private';
- Result: 2

Assessment
- The data shows exactly two entries with entrant = Private.
- Those two entries correspond to drivers Toni Branca and Philippe Étancelin.
- Their tyre codes are P and D, respectively.

Conclusion
- The claim is fully supported by the dataset.

Assumptions
- “Entrant be private on 2 occasion” refers to counting rows in the 1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset where entrant equals “Private”.
