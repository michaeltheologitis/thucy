Claim interpreted: The lowest-attendance game in May of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season was played against the Athletics.

Data source discovery and structure
- Identified table: public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season (authoritative for May 1991 Blue Jays games).
- Table schema (columns and types) retrieved via SQL:
  SQL: SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season';
  Result summary: columns = date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text).

Evidence 1: Minimum attendance game in May 1991
- Query to find the game(s) with the minimum attendance:
  SQL: SELECT date, opponent, attendance, score FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE attendance = (SELECT MIN(attendance) FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season);
- Result: date = May 3, opponent = Royals, attendance = 20809, score = 5 - 1.
- This shows the lowest-attended game was against the Royals, not the Athletics.

Evidence 2: Full ordering by attendance (context and confirmation)
- Query to list all May games ordered by attendance ascending:
  SQL: SELECT date, opponent, attendance, score FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season ORDER BY attendance ASC;
- Excerpt of results (lowest to higher):
  • May 3 — Royals — 20809 — 5 - 1
  • May 5 — Royals — 22588 — 3 - 0
  • May 4 — Royals — 22628 — 6 - 5
  • May 21 — Athletics — 22738 — 11 - 7
  • May 2 — Royals — 22896 — 3 - 1
  • May 20 — Athletics — 24631 — 1 - 0
  ... (additional rows show higher attendances, including several Athletics games at 34,028; 50,262; 50,271; 50,299)
- This confirms the Athletics were not involved in the lowest-attendance game.

Evidence 3: Completeness check (row count)
- Query to count recorded games in the table:
  SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS game_count FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season;
- Result: 27 games, consistent with a full month’s schedule, supporting completeness for May.

Conclusion
- The lowest-attendance May 1991 Blue Jays game (20,809) was on May 3 against the Royals. Therefore, it was not played against the Athletics.

Assumptions
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season contains all Toronto Blue Jays games for May 1991 (supported by 27 recorded games).
- Opponent names are standardized in lowercase (e.g., athletics, royals, white sox, etc.).
