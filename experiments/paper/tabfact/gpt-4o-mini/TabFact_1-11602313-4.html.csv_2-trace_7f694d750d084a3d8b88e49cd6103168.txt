Summary of approach:
- Discovered available data sources and identified a PostgreSQL database (public schema) containing a table named list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors relevant to Intel Pentium Dual-Core CPUs.
- Reviewed the table schema to locate columns for model number, fsb, and part number(s).
- Queried the table for the Pentium Dual-Core T3200 to extract its specifications.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database, public schema.
- Relevant table: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors

Table schema (key columns):
- model number (text)
- sspec number (text)
- frequency (text)
- l2 cache (text)
- fsb (text)
- mult (bigint)
- voltage (text)
- tdp (text)
- socket (text)
- release date (text)
- part number (s) (text)
- release price ( usd ) (text)

Evidence query and results:
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors WHERE "model number" ILIKE '%T3200%';

Returned row (key fields relevant to the claim):
- model number: pentium dual - core t3200
- fsb: 667 mt / s
- part number (s): lf80537 gf0411 m
- sspec number: slavg (m0)
- additional fields (for completeness): frequency: 2 ghz; l2 cache: 1 mb; tdp: 35 w; socket: socket p; release date: q4 2008; release price ( usd ): oem

Assessment of the claim:
- Claim: "the pentium dual - core t3200 have a lf80537 gf0411 m part number and a fsb of 667 mt / s"
- Evidence: The database record for pentium dual - core t3200 shows part number (s) = "lf80537 gf0411 m" and fsb = "667 mt / s".
- Conclusion: The claim is fully supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Interpreted spacing and case-insensitivity as non-substantive (e.g., "mt / s" vs "MT/s" and lowercase vs uppercase).
