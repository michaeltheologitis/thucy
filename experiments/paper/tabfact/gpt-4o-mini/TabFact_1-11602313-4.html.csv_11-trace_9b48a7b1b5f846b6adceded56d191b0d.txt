Claim to verify: “the release date for the model with sspec number SLA4H (M0) be Q2 2008 with part number (s) LF80537 GE0301 M.”

Data source explored: public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors (columns include: model number, sspec number, release date, part number (s), etc.).

Findings grounded in data:
- The S-Spec “SLA4H (M0)” exists in the dataset and corresponds to the Pentium Dual-Core T2390. Its recorded release date is Q2 2008. However, its part number(s) is listed as “LF80537 GE0361 M,” not “LF80537 GE0301 M.”
- The part number “LF80537 GE0301 M” is present in the dataset but is associated with a different S-Spec (“SLA4J (M0)”) and a different model (Pentium Dual-Core T2370), with a release date of Q4 2007.

Supporting evidence (executed SQL and results):
1) Locate SLA4H (M0) and its attributes
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "release date", "part number (s)" 
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
WHERE LOWER("sspec number") LIKE '%sla4h%';
Result:
- Model Number: Pentium Dual - Core T2390
- SSpec Number: SLA4H (M0)
- Release Date: Q2 2008
- Part Number (s): LF80537 GE0361 M

2) Check which entry uses part number GE0301
SQL:
SELECT "model number", "sspec number", "release date", "part number (s)" 
FROM public.list_of_intel_pentium_dual_core_microprocessors 
WHERE LOWER("part number (s)") LIKE '%ge0301%';
Result:
- Model Number: Pentium Dual - Core T2370
- SSPEC Number: SLA4J (M0)
- Release Date: Q4 2007
- Part Number(s): LF80537 GE0301 M

Conclusion:
- Correct: Release date for S-Spec SLA4H (M0) is Q2 2008.
- Incorrect: The part number for SLA4H (M0) is not LF80537 GE0301 M; it is LF80537 GE0361 M in the dataset.

Assumptions and notes:
- Matching on S-Spec and part number was performed case-insensitively and as substring searches because fields may contain additional text or formatting (e.g., parentheses, spaces). The dataset’s formatting of part numbers includes spaces (e.g., “LF80537 GE0361 M”).
- The verification is based solely on the available table of Intel Pentium Dual-Core microprocessors, treated as authoritative per instructions.
