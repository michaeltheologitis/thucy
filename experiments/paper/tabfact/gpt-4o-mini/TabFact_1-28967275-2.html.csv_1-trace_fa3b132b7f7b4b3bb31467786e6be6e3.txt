Summary conclusion: Verified. In the available dataset, series 8 is associated with production code 208. Evidence shows exactly one episode in series 8 with production code 208, and production code 208 appears only in series 8.

Data source discovery:
- Available source: PostgreSQL database with table public.my_info_table.

Schema inspection (public.my_info_table):
- Columns:
  - episode (bigint)
  - series (bigint)
  - episode title (text)
  - original air date (text)
  - production code (bigint)
- No explicit primary keys or relationships defined.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Count rows with series = 8 and production code = 208
- Result: 1 row
- SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE series = 8 AND "production code" = 208;

2) Retrieve details for rows where series = 8 and production code = 208
- Result:
  - Episode: 34
  - Episode Title: rocket 's decent
  - Original Air Date: 27 April 2008
  - Series: 8
  - Production Code: 208
- SQL:
SELECT episode, "episode title", "original air date", series, "production code" 
FROM public.my_info_table 
WHERE series = 8 AND "production code" = 208;

3) List distinct production codes in series 8 (with counts)
- Result: production code 208 with 1 episode
- SQL:
SELECT "production code", COUNT(episode) as episode_count
FROM my_info_table
WHERE series = 8
GROUP BY "production code";

4) List series values associated with production code = 208 (with counts)
- Result: series 8 with 1 episode
- SQL:
SELECT series, COUNT(episode) AS episode_count 
FROM public.my_info_table
WHERE "production code" = 208
GROUP BY series;

Assessment:
- The data shows series 8 has production code 208 associated with it in at least one row, and no other production codes are present for series 8. Likewise, production code 208 does not appear for other series.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted the claim as asserting that, in this dataset, series number 8 is associated with production code 208 (i.e., at least one episode in series 8 carries production code 208, and no conflicting production code exists for that series).
