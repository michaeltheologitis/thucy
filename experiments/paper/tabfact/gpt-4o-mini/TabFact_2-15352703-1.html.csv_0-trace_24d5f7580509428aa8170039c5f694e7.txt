Summary of findings:
- The available data source contains a table public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season with draft-related fields (round, pick, player, position, college).
- Querying this table for pick number 155 returns a single record: John Nies, Punter, College: Arizona.
- “Arizona” in the college field corresponds to University of Arizona. Therefore, the claim that draft pick number 155 came from Arizona University (interpreted as University of Arizona) is supported.

Evidence and executed SQL:
1) Table structure confirmation
Executed SQL:
SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
FROM information_schema.columns
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_1990_buffalo_bills_season';

Result (abridged):
- round (bigint)
- pick (bigint)
- player (text)
- position (text)
- college (text)

2) Retrieve pick 155 details
Executed SQL:
SELECT player, position, college FROM public.t_1990_buffalo_bills_season WHERE pick = 155;

Result:
- player: John Nies
- position: Punter
- college: Arizona

Conclusion:
- The data shows pick 155 corresponds to a player whose listed college is “Arizona,” which aligns with the University of Arizona.

Assumptions:
- The term “Arizona University” is interpreted as “University of Arizona,” matching the dataset’s “Arizona.”
- The dataset pertains to NFL draft picks associated with the 1990 Buffalo Bills context, and the “pick” column denotes overall draft pick number.
