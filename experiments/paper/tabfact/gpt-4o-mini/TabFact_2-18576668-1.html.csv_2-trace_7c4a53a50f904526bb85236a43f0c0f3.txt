Summary
- Interpreting “standard format” as the format used consistently within the available dataset (table: tsuyoshi_fujita), multi-year seasons are stored as "YYYY - YY" (with spaces around the hyphen). Single-year entries appear as just the year (e.g., "2005").
- The seasons 2001 - 02, 2002 - 03, and 2003 - 04 already match this standard format in the data.

Evidence from Data
1) Distinct season values and counts
- Result excerpt shows seasons recorded as "YYYY - YY" for multi-year seasons and single year for others. The provided seasons appear exactly in this form.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as count FROM tsuyoshi_fujita GROUP BY season;

- Returned values (abbrev.):
  • 1997 - 98: 1
  • 1998 - 99: 2
  • 1999 - 00: 1
  • 2000 - 01: 3
  • 2001 - 02: 4
  • 2002 - 03: 3
  • 2003 - 04: 2
  • 2005: 4
  • 2011: 1

2) Direct confirmation for the three seasons
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, COUNT(*) as record_count FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04') GROUP BY season;

SELECT DISTINCT season FROM tsuyoshi_fujita WHERE season IN ('2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04');

- Results:
  • 2001 - 02: 4 records
  • 2002 - 03: 3 records
  • 2003 - 04: 2 records
  • Distinct season strings returned exactly as: '2001 - 02', '2002 - 03', '2003 - 04'

Conclusion
- The seasons "2001 - 02", "2002 - 03", and "2003 - 04" are already in the dataset’s standard multi-year season format: "YYYY - YY" (with spaces around the hyphen).

Assumptions
- “Standard format” refers to the formatting convention used within the available dataset (tsuyoshi_fujita), not an external or style-guide-driven format.
