Claim: “on august 26 the attendance be 24343 and on august 27 the attendance be 2142.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a single table: public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season (Colorado Rockies 1997 season game logs).
- Verified schema: columns include date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text). Dates are stored as text like “august 1”.

Step 1: Inspect date formatting
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season LIMIT 10;
Result (excerpt): dates appear as lowercase month names with day numbers (e.g., “august 1”, “august 2”, …) and attendance as integers.

Step 2: Retrieve attendance for August 26 and August 27
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, attendance FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date IN ('august 26', 'august 27');
Results:
- august 26: 48063
- august 27: 48032

Step 3: Confirm uniqueness and context (opponent/score)
Executed SQL:
SELECT opponent, score, attendance FROM public.t_1997_colorado_rockies_season WHERE date = 'august 26' OR date = 'august 27';
Results:
- August 26 vs. Reds, Score 9 - 5, Attendance 48,063
- August 27 vs. Reds, Score 7 - 5, Attendance 48,032

Assessment
- The claimed attendance figures (24,343 on August 26 and 2,142 on August 27) do not match the data. Actual recorded attendances are 48,063 and 48,032, respectively. Both claimed values are substantially lower than the verified figures.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- The dates refer to the Colorado Rockies 1997 season games (the only available dataset). The table stores dates as text without an explicit year, but it represents the 1997 season context.
