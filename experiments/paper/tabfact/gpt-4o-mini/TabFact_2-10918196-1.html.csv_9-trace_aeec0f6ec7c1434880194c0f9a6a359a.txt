Claim to verify:
“The New York Jets had 992 more in crowd attendance in their second game against the New England Patriots than in their first game against them during the 1993 season.”

Data source discovery:
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season (1993 New York Jets season data).
- Relevant columns: week (bigint), date (text), opponent (text), result (text), "game site" (text), attendance (bigint).

Evidence retrieved (executed SQL and results excerpt):
1) All 1993 Jets games (used to identify both Patriots matchups and their attendance figures)
Executed SQL:
SELECT week, date, opponent, "game site", result, attendance 
FROM public.t_1993_new_york_jets_season 
ORDER BY week ASC;

Relevant rows from the result:
- Week 4 | 1993 - 09 - 26 | New England Patriots | The Meadowlands | W 45 - 7 | Attendance: 64836
- Week 13 | 1993 - 11 - 28 | New England Patriots | Foxboro Stadium | W 6 - 0 | Attendance: 42810

Computation:
- First game attendance (Week 4): 64,836
- Second game attendance (Week 13): 42,810
- Difference (second − first): 42,810 − 64,836 = −22,026

Assessment:
- The second game’s crowd attendance was 22,026 fewer than the first game, not 992 more. The data contradicts the claim.

Conclusion:
- The claim is inaccurate based on the season data in the authoritative table.

Assumptions:
- “Second game” is interpreted chronologically within the 1993 season as the later meeting (Week 13) versus the earlier meeting (Week 4).
- “Crowd attendance” refers to the attendance field recorded for each game in the dataset.
