Claim assessed: “3.22 million viewers watched ‘The Gold Job’ directed by Arvin Brown.”

Findings from the authoritative data source (TabFact database, table: public.list_of_leverage_episodes):

1) Does an episode with title containing “Gold” exist, and what are its director and U.S. viewers?
- Evidence query (exact SQL executed):
  SELECT season, title, "directed by", "us viewers (in millions)"
  FROM list_of_leverage_episodes
  WHERE title ILIKE '%Gold%';
- Result:
  Season: 16; Title: The Gold Job; Director: Marc Roskin; U.S. Viewers: 2.26 million
- Conclusion: “The Gold Job” exists in the dataset, is directed by Marc Roskin (not Arvin Brown), and had 2.26 million U.S. viewers.

2) Are there any Leverage episodes directed by Arvin Brown, and what are their U.S. viewers?
- Evidence query (exact SQL executed):
  SELECT title, "us viewers (in millions)"
  FROM list_of_leverage_episodes
  WHERE "directed by" ILIKE '%Arvin Brown%';
- Results:
  • Title: the 10 li'l grifters job — U.S. Viewers: 2.46 million
  • Title: the boiler room job — U.S. Viewers: 3.29 million
- Conclusion: Arvin Brown did direct episodes of Leverage, but not “The Gold Job,” and none of his episodes have 3.22 million viewers in this dataset.

3) Which episode has exactly 3.22 million U.S. viewers?
- Evidence query (exact SQL executed):
  SELECT title, "directed by"
  FROM list_of_leverage_episodes
  WHERE "us viewers (in millions)" = 3.22;
- Result:
  Title: The Queen's Gambit Job; Directed by: Jonathan Frakes
- Conclusion: The 3.22 million figure corresponds to “The Queen’s Gambit Job,” directed by Jonathan Frakes, not to “The Gold Job.”

Overall assessment:
- Director: The claim attributes Arvin Brown to “The Gold Job,” but the data shows the director is Marc Roskin.
- Viewership: The claim states 3.22 million viewers for “The Gold Job,” but the data shows 2.26 million viewers. The 3.22 million figure belongs to a different episode (“The Queen’s Gambit Job”).

Answer: The claim is contradicted by the data on both the director and the viewership.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted “the gold job” as the episode whose title contains “Gold,” as returned by the episodes dataset.
- Interpreted “viewer watch” as U.S. viewers (in millions) per the column "us viewers (in millions)" in the dataset.
- Interpreted “arvin brown” as the director’s name string exactly as stored in the dataset.
