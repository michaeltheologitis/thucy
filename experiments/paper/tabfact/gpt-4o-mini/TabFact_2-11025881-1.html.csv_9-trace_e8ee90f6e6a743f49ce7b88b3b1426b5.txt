Claim interpreted: “the gap between first and last be less than 50 point.” I interpret this as: in the 1976 World Junior Figure Skating Championships table, the difference in the ‘points’ between the first-place (rank = 1) and last-place (highest rank) competitors is less than 50 points.

Data source discovery:
- Available database: public schema containing table t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships.

Step 1: Confirm the ranking range
- SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships;
  Result: 19
- SQL:
  SELECT MIN(rank) AS minimum_rank FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships;
  Result: 1
- SQL:
  SELECT MAX(rank) AS maximum_rank FROM public.t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships;
  Result: 19

Step 2: Retrieve points for first place (rank = 1)
- SQL:
  SELECT rank, name, nation, points FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = 1;
  Result: rank=1, name=Mark Cockerell, nation=United States, points=172.42

Step 3: Retrieve points for last place (rank = MAX(rank))
- SQL:
  SELECT rank, name, nation, points 
  FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships 
  WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships);
  Result: rank=19, name=Marc Franquet, nation=Belgium, points=114.38

Step 4: Compute the points gap (first − last)
- SQL (supporting breakdown):
  SELECT points AS first_rank_points
  FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  WHERE rank = (SELECT MIN(rank) FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships);
  Result: 172.42
- SQL:
  SELECT points AS last_rank_points
  FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships
  WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships);
  Result: 114.38
- SQL (difference):
  SELECT (SELECT points FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MIN(rank) FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships)) - 
  (SELECT points FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships WHERE rank = (SELECT MAX(rank) FROM t_1976_world_junior_figure_skating_championships)) AS points_difference;
  Result: 58.04

Conclusion:
- The gap between first and last is 58.04 points, which is not less than 50. The claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions made:
- “First” refers to the competitor with rank = 1; “last” refers to the competitor with the maximum rank in the table (rank = 19).
- “Point” refers to the ‘points’ column in the dataset.
