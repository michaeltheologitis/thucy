Claim to verify:
"2012 set the record for the year with the highest score of 29 - 7. 2013 follow with 27 - 9"

Data source discovery:
- Available database contains one table: public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball (trusted as authoritative per instructions).

Schema (from inspection):
- Columns: year (bigint), record (text), seed (bigint), region (text), results (text).

Evidence Step 1: List seasons and parse wins/losses
- Finding: The dataset shows 2012 with a record of 29 - 7 and 2013 with a record of 27 - 9 among other seasons.
- Key rows returned:
  - 2012: Wins 29, Losses 7
  - 2013: Wins 27, Losses 9
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year,
       CAST(SPLIT_PART(record, '-', 1) AS bigint) AS wins,
       CAST(SPLIT_PART(record, '-', 2) AS bigint) AS losses
FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
ORDER BY year ASC;

Evidence Step 2: Identify the maximum number of wins and corresponding year(s)
- Finding: The maximum number of wins is 29, which occurs in 2012 (record 29 - 7). Next-highest wins are 28 (e.g., 2007 and 2011), confirming 2012 is the top season by wins in this dataset.
- Executed SQL:
SELECT year, record, wins
FROM (
    SELECT year, record,
           CAST(SUBSTRING(record FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) AS wins
    FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
) AS extracted_wins
WHERE wins = (SELECT MAX(wins) FROM (
    SELECT CAST(SUBSTRING(record FROM '([0-9]+)') AS INTEGER) AS wins
    FROM public.vcu_rams_men_s_basketball
) AS inner_extracted_wins)

Assessment of the claim:
- "2012 set the record for the year with the highest score of 29 - 7": Supported. The data show 2012 has the most wins (29) of any listed season, with a record of 29 - 7.
- "2013 follow with 27 - 9": Supported as a chronological statement about the subsequent year’s record; the data show 2013 is 27 - 9.

Conclusion: The claim matches the data provided by the table.

Assumptions made:
- Interpreted "score" to mean season win-loss record (wins-losses) as stored in the record column.
- Interpreted "follow" to mean the next chronological season (2013) rather than implying the second-highest all-time wins. The data indicate 2011 and 2007 each had 28 wins, which is higher than 2013’s 27 wins, but that does not contradict the chronological reading of the claim.
