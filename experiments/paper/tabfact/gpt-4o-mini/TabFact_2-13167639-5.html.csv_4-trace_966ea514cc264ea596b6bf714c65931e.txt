Claim: "the semifinal first leg record attendance less than 50000"

Data source explored
- PostgreSQL table: public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season (Manchester United 2002–03 season)
- Relevant columns: date (text), round (text), opponents (text), result f - a (text), attendance (bigint)

Schema exploration
Executed SQL:
SELECT DISTINCT round FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season;
Result highlights:
- semi - final first leg
- semi - final second leg
- round 3, round 4, round 5, final

Evidence query 1: Retrieve semifinal first leg match(es)
Executed SQL:
SELECT date, opponents, "result f - a", attendance 
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season 
WHERE round = 'semi - final first leg';
Result:
- Date: 7 January 2003; Opponents: Blackburn Rovers; Result: 1 - 1; Attendance: 62740

Evidence query 2: Max/min attendance for semifinal first leg
Executed SQL:
SELECT MAX(attendance) AS max_attendance, MIN(attendance) AS min_attendance 
FROM public.t_2002_03_manchester_united_f_c_season 
WHERE round = 'semi - final first leg';
Result:
- max_attendance: 62740; min_attendance: 62740

Assessment
- The only "semi - final first leg" match recorded in this dataset has an attendance of 62,740, which is greater than 50,000. Therefore, the statement that the semifinal first leg record attendance is less than 50,000 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- "semifinal first leg" refers to entries labeled exactly as "semi - final first leg" in this Manchester United 2002–03 season dataset.
- "record attendance" is interpreted as the attendance recorded for that match (and equivalently the maximum among such matches in this dataset).
