Claim to verify: “skip ron macdonald have a pf of 67 and end lost of 51.”

Data sources explored
- Database: public schema
- Table: t_2005_tim_hortons_brier (curling stats for the 2005 Tim Hortons Brier). Relevant columns include skip (text), pf (bigint, Points For), and "ends lost" (bigint).

Evidence
1) Search for any skip with the surname MacDonald and retrieve PF and Ends Lost
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT skip, pf, "ends lost"
  FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier
  WHERE LOWER(skip) LIKE '%macdonald%';
- Result:
  - Skip: Rod MacDonald; PF: 67; Ends Lost: 51

2) Check if there is an exact (case-insensitive) match for the skip name “Ron MacDonald”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT skip, pf, "ends lost" FROM public.t_2005_tim_hortons_brier WHERE LOWER(skip) = LOWER('Ron MacDonald');
- Result: No rows returned (no such skip in this table)

Assessment
- The statistics PF = 67 and Ends Lost = 51 are present in the dataset for skip Rod MacDonald.
- There is no record for a skip named Ron MacDonald in this dataset.

Conclusion
- The numerical stats are correct but attributed to Rod MacDonald, not Ron MacDonald.

Assumptions made
- “end lost” in the claim refers to the “ends lost” statistic in the table.
- The intended person was the Brier skip with surname MacDonald in this dataset, presumed to be Rod MacDonald.
