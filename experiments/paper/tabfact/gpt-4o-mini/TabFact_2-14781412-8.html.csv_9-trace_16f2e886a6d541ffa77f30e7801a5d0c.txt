Summary of data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with table public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games containing: year (bigint), location (text), gold (text), silver (text), bronze (text).

Evidence collected (with executed SQL)
1) All years and locations recorded
- SQL:
  SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games ORDER BY year ASC;
- Result (ordered by year):
  1982 — new delhi
  1986 — seoul
  1994 — hiroshima
  1998 — bangkok
  2002 — busan
  2006 — doha
  2010 — guangzhou

2) Count of entries per location
- SQL:
  SELECT location, COUNT(*) AS count FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games GROUP BY location;
- Result:
  new delhi — 1
  seoul — 1
  busan — 1
  hiroshima — 1
  bangkok — 1
  guangzhou — 1
  doha — 1
- Interpretation: No city (location) appears more than once in this dataset.

3) Check how many times Seoul appears
- SQL:
  SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE lower(location) = 'seoul';
- Result:
  1986 — seoul
- Interpretation: Seoul appears exactly once (1986).

4) Check how many times Busan appears
- SQL:
  SELECT year, location FROM public.equestrian_at_the_asian_games WHERE LOWER(location) = 'busan';
- Result:
  2002 — busan
- Interpretation: Busan appears exactly once (2002).

Assessment of the claim
- Claim: “south korea be the only country to have host equestrian at the asian game more than 1 time , in seoul 2 time.”
- What the data supports:
  • South Korea is represented twice in the dataset via two distinct locations: seoul (1986) and busan (2002). Thus, South Korea hosted equestrian events more than once within the years covered by this table.
  • No other listed location repeats, and based on widely known city-country associations from the locations in the table (new delhi—India, hiroshima—Japan, bangkok—Thailand, doha—Qatar, guangzhou—China), only South Korea appears twice (seoul and busan).
- What the data contradicts:
  • “in seoul 2 time” is false in this dataset. Seoul appears once (1986), not twice.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows South Korea hosted equestrian events at least twice (Seoul 1986 and Busan 2002), and no other country appears more than once in the provided records. However, the specific statement that Seoul hosted twice is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions and scope
- Assumed the well-known city-to-country mappings (e.g., Seoul and Busan are in South Korea) to evaluate the “only country” portion. The table itself contains only city names.
- The dataset covers entries from 1982 through 2010; conclusions apply within this scope of available data.
