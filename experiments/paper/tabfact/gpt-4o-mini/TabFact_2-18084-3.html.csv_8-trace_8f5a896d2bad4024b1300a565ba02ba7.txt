Claim: "bob beamon have recently set his long jump record"

Data source discovery
- Database: TabFact (PostgreSQL)
- Schema: public
- Table: long_jump with columns [mark (text), wind (double precision), athlete (text), nationality (text), venue (text), date (text)]

Evidence gathered
1) Retrieve all entries for Bob Beamon
- SQL: SELECT mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, date FROM public.long_jump WHERE athlete = 'Bob Beamon' ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: No rows returned.

2) Case-insensitive search for Beamon
- SQL: SELECT mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, date FROM public.long_jump WHERE athlete ILIKE '%beamon%';
- Result:
  - Athlete: Bob Beamon; Mark: 8.90 m (29ft 2¼in) a; Wind: 2; Nationality: United States; Venue: Mexico City; Date: October 18, 1968

3) Aggregate check to confirm all Beamon entries and their dates
- SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) AS count, MIN(date) AS min_date, MAX(date) AS max_date FROM long_jump WHERE athlete ILIKE '%beamon%';
- Result: count = 1; min_date = "October 18, 1968"; max_date = "October 18, 1968"

4) Context check: later world-record holder (for recency comparison)
- SQL: SELECT mark, wind, athlete, nationality, venue, date FROM public.long_jump WHERE athlete ILIKE '%powell%' ORDER BY date ASC;
- Result: Athlete: Mike Powell; Mark: 8.95 m (29ft4¼in); Wind: 0.3; Nationality: United States; Venue: Tokyo; Date: August 30, 1991

Assessment
- The only entry for Bob Beamon in the long_jump table is dated October 18, 1968 (Mexico City). There are no newer entries for him. Therefore, the statement that he "recently" set his long jump record is not supported by the data. In fact, the table shows a later world record by Mike Powell dated 1991, further contradicting the idea that Beamon has a recent record.

Conclusion
- Based on the authoritative dataset, Bob Beamon did not recently set his long jump record; his recorded mark dates to 1968.

Assumptions
- "Recently" is interpreted in its plain-sense meaning (e.g., within the past few years). Regardless of exact threshold, 1968 is not recent by any reasonable definition.
- "Set his long jump record" is interpreted as setting a notable record (personal best/world record) captured in the long_jump table. The dataset contains only one entry for Beamon from 1968.
