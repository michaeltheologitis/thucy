Claim interpreted: The statement asserts that Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy are the only players with a to-par score of +1 in the available 2006 U.S. Open dataset.

Data source discovery
- Identified data source: a PostgreSQL database with a table likely related to the 2006 U.S. Open Golf Championship.
- Table present: public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf

Evidence of table existence
- SQL executed:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
  Result included: t_2006_u_s_open_golf

Schema inspection
- Columns in public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf:
  place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), to par (text)
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable
  FROM information_schema.columns
  WHERE table_name = 't_2006_u_s_open_golf' AND table_schema = 'public';

Direct test of the claim: who has to par = +1?
- Exact match on '+ 1' (note the space):
  SQL executed:
  SELECT player, place, score, "to par" FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE "to par" = '+ 1' ORDER BY player;
  Result:
  - Geoff Ogilvy | t3 | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1
  - Kenneth Ferrie | t3 | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1

Normalization check (remove spaces) to ensure no formatting variants exist:
- Count rows where normalized to_par equals '+1':
  SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count
  FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE REPLACE("to par", ' ', '') = '+1';
  Result: 2
- List players matching normalized '+1':
  SQL executed:
  SELECT player
  FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf
  WHERE REPLACE("to par", ' ', '') = '+1';
  Result: Kenneth Ferrie, Geoff Ogilvy

Corroborative name search (to view full rows for these players):
- SQL executed:
  SELECT * FROM public.t_2006_u_s_open_golf WHERE player ILIKE '%ogilvy%' OR player ILIKE '%ferrie%';
  Result (abbrev.):
  - Kenneth Ferrie | England | T3 | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1
  - Geoff Ogilvy | Australia | T3 | 71 + 70 = 141 | + 1

Conclusion
- Within the available dataset, the only players with a to-par value of +1 are Kenneth Ferrie and Geoff Ogilvy. This directly supports the claim as interpreted for this dataset.

Assumptions
- The claim refers to the scoring context represented by this table (which, based on the "score" format like "71 + 70 = 141", appears to reflect a multi-round aggregate—likely after two rounds of the 2006 U.S. Open). No other rounds or tournaments are considered beyond what is present in this dataset.
- "Only player" is interpreted as "only players," since two names are provided.
