Claim interpreted: The user asserts that on the starting grid, Jackie Stewart is in 1st position, followed by (at the back) Howden Ganley in 24th and Alex Soler-Roig in 25th (i.e., the largest grid number). Dataset appears to be the 1971 South African Grand Prix.

Step 1: Explore data sources
- Data discovery indicates a PostgreSQL database with table public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix.

Schema check
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
AND table_name = 't_1971_south_african_grand_prix';
Result (abridged): driver (text), constructor (text), laps (bigint), time / retired (text), grid (bigint)

Step 2: Retrieve grid order to verify positions
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix ORDER BY grid ASC;
Key results (ordered by grid):
1. Jackie Stewart — Grid 1
2. Chris Amon — Grid 2
3. Clay Regazzoni — Grid 3
...
23. Jo Bonnier — Grid 23
24. Howden Ganley — Grid 24
25. Alex Soler-Roig — Grid 25

Step 3: Verify that 25 is the highest (largest) grid number and who holds it
SQL executed:
SELECT MAX(grid) AS max_grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix;
Result: max_grid = 25

SQL executed:
SELECT driver FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE grid = (SELECT MAX(grid) FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix);
Result: Alex Soler-Roig (note: name may appear with minor punctuation/casing variations)

Step 4: Directly verify the three named drivers’ grids
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix 
WHERE driver ILIKE '%Stewart%' OR driver ILIKE '%Ganley%' OR driver ILIKE '%Soler%';
Results:
- Jackie Stewart — Grid 1
- Howden Ganley — Grid 24
- Alex Soler-Roig — Grid 25

Step 5: Confirm the back of the grid ordering
SQL executed (highest grid numbers):
SELECT driver, grid FROM public.t_1971_south_african_grand_prix ORDER BY grid DESC LIMIT 3;
Results (descending):
- Alex Soler-Roig — Grid 25
- Howden Ganley — Grid 24
- Jo Bonnier — Grid 23

Conclusion
- Jackie Stewart is on grid position 1.
- Howden Ganley is on grid position 24.
- Alex Soler-Roig is on grid position 25, which is the largest (farthest back) grid number in this dataset.
- The relative order at the back of the grid is Jo Bonnier (23), Howden Ganley (24), Alex Soler-Roig (25). The claim’s core elements are supported.

Assumptions made
- “Highest position at 25 on grid” is interpreted as the highest grid number (i.e., farthest back starting position) rather than “best” position. The dataset pertains to the 1971 South African Grand Prix starting grid.
