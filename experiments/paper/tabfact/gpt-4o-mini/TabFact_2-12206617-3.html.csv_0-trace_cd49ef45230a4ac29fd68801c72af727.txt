Claim to verify: “the toronto blue jay play in 8 game with an attendance greater than 5000 in May of the 1991 season.”

Summary conclusion: The data shows 27 Toronto Blue Jays games in May 1991, and all 27 had attendance greater than 5,000. The claim (8 games) is contradicted by the evidence.

Data exploration and evidence

1) Identify available data and table schema
- Purpose: Confirm the presence and structure of the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays season table.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT column_name, data_type, is_nullable 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 't_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season';
- Result (abridged):
  date (text), opponent (text), score (text), loss (text), attendance (bigint), record (text)

2) Inspect sample rows to understand date format and attendance values
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, opponent, attendance FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season LIMIT 5;
- Sample result:
  may 1 | rangers | 33,439
  may 2 | royals  | 22,896
  may 3 | royals  | 20,809
  may 4 | royals  | 22,628
  may 5 | royals  | 22,588

3) Count May games with attendance > 5,000
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may %' AND attendance > 5000;
- Result: 27

4) Cross-check: total May games and how many exceed 5,000 attendance
- Executed SQL (total May games):
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_may 
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may %';
- Result: total_may = 27

- Executed SQL (May games with attendance > 5,000):
  SELECT SUM(CASE WHEN attendance > 5000 THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS may_over_5000 
  FROM public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season 
  WHERE lower(date) LIKE 'may %';
- Result: may_over_5000 = 27

Conclusion
- The claim states there were 8 such games. The data shows there were 27. Therefore, the claim is inaccurate.

Assumptions made
- The table public.t_1991_toronto_blue_jays_season contains all Toronto Blue Jays games for the 1991 season.
- The date column’s values like “may X” refer to May 1991.
- The comparison “greater than 5000” is strictly > 5000 (i.e., 5001 or more).
