Claim to verify: Episode number 67 (“The Lorelais’ First Day at Yale”) had more viewers than episode 69 (“Chicken or Beef?”).

What the data shows:
- Episode 67
  - Title in dataset: the lorelais' first day at yale
  - US viewers (million): 3.9
- Episode 69
  - Title in dataset: chicken or beef
  - US viewers (million): 5.5

Conclusion based on data:
- Episode 67 did not have more viewers than episode 69. Episode 69 had higher viewership (5.5M vs 3.9M).
- The episode numbers and titles correspond as stated (minor differences in capitalization/punctuation in the source table).

Executed SQL (evidence):
1) SQL to retrieve episode numbers, titles, and viewers
SELECT no, title, "us viewers (million)" FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no IN (67, 69);

Result:
- 67 | the lorelais' first day at yale | 3.9
- 69 | chicken or beef | 5.5

2) SQL to confirm titles by episode number
SELECT title FROM list_of_gilmore_girls_episodes WHERE no = 67 OR no = 69;

Result:
- 67 -> the lorelais' first day at yale
- 69 -> chicken or beef

Assumptions:
- “Viewers” refers to the column “us viewers (million)” in the dataset.
- Title punctuation/capitalization differences are treated as non-substantive naming variations.
