Claim interpreted: “When set 3 is 18-25, the total is 53-75.” Interpreted within the available dataset on 2002 FIVB Women’s Volleyball World Championship qualification, where columns include date, score, set 1, set 2, set 3, total (all text).

Data source discovery:
- Database: PostgreSQL (public schema)
- Table: t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification

Executed evidence queries and results:
1) Check for any row where set 3 = '18-25' AND total = '53-75'
SQL:
SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total 
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification 
WHERE "set 3" = '18-25' AND total = '53-75';
Result: No matching records found.

2) Check whether any row has set 3 = '18-25'
SQL:
SELECT date, score, "set 1", "set 2", "set 3", total 
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification 
WHERE "set 3" = '18-25' 
LIMIT 5;
Result: No rows found with set 3 = '18-25'.

3) Check whether any row has total = '53-75'
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS cnt 
FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification 
WHERE total = '53-75';
Result: cnt = 0 (no rows with total = '53-75').

4) Confirm table is populated (sanity check)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_rows FROM public.t_2002_fivb_women_s_volleyball_world_championship_qualification;
Result: total_rows = 6.

Conclusion:
- The dataset contains no rows where set 3 equals 18-25 and no rows where total equals 53-75. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the available data.

Assumptions made:
- “Set 3” refers to the column named "set 3" and “total” refers to the column named total in the discovered table.
- The user’s claim pertains to the matches contained in this specific dataset (2002 FIVB Women’s Volleyball World Championship qualification).
