Conclusion: The claim is inaccurate. In the available data for 2007, the "Favorite Movie Actor" category lists Jack Black (for Nacho Libre) as a nominee, and there is no evidence that Rosie O'Donnell was a winner or nominee in that category in 2007. Rosie O'Donnell appears in the dataset only as a nominee for "Favorite Movie Actress" in 1997 (Harriet the Spy), not in 2007 nor in the "Favorite Movie Actor" category.

Key Evidence from Executed SQL:

1) 2007 entries for the "Favorite Movie Actor" category
SQL:
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result 
FROM public.nickelodeon_movies 
WHERE year = 2007 AND category ILIKE '%Favorite Movie Actor%';
Result:
- Year: 2007; Category: Favorite Movie Actor; Film: Nacho Libre; Winner / Nominee(s): Jack Black; Result: Nominated

2) Search for Rosie O'Donnell within 2007 "Favorite Movie Actor"
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.nickelodeon_movies WHERE year = 2007 AND category ILIKE '%Favorite Movie Actor%' AND ("winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%Rosie%' OR "winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%O''Donnell%')
Result: No rows returned

3) Full list of 2007 entries for context
SQL:
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result 
FROM public.nickelodeon_movies 
WHERE year = 2007 
ORDER BY category, result DESC, film;
Result:
- Favorite Movie Actor: Nacho Libre — Jack Black — Nominated
- Favorite Movie Actress: Charlotte's Web — Dakota Fanning — Won

4) Global search for Rosie O'Donnell in the dataset
SQL:
SELECT year, category, film, "winner / nominee (s)", result 
FROM public.nickelodeon_movies 
WHERE "winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%Rosie%' OR "winner / nominee (s)" ILIKE '%O''Donnell%';
Result:
- Year: 1997; Category: Favorite Movie Actress; Film: Harriet the Spy; Winner / Nominee(s): Rosie O'Donnell; Result: Nominated

Assessment:
- There is no evidence that Rosie O'Donnell was a winner or nominee for the 2007 "Favorite Movie Actor" category. The dataset shows a different nominee (Jack Black) for that category in 2007 and places Rosie O'Donnell in a different year and category entirely.

Assumptions:
- "Favorite Movie Actor" refers to the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards movie categories, as implied by the table name (public.nickelodeon_movies) and schema context. All conclusions are based strictly on this authoritative dataset.
