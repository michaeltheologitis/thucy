Claim to verify: “Keith Gordon directed 2 episodes of Dexter in Season 3.”

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with schema public containing table dexter_season_3.
- Table columns: "no in series" (bigint), "no in season" (bigint), "title" (text), "directed by" (text), "written by" (text), "original air date" (text), "us viewers (millions)" (text).

Evidence from executed SQL:
1) Count episodes directed by Keith Gordon (case-insensitive equality)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE LOWER("directed by") = LOWER('Keith Gordon')
Result: episode_count = 2

2) List the matching episodes
SQL:
SELECT "no in season", "title", "directed by" FROM public.dexter_season_3 WHERE LOWER("directed by") = LOWER('Keith Gordon')
Results:
- no in season: 1, title: Our Father, directed by: Keith Gordon
- no in season: 4, title: All in the Family, directed by: Keith Gordon

3) Cross-check using substring match (case-insensitive)
SQL:
SELECT COUNT(*) AS row_count, "no in season", title 
FROM public.dexter_season_3 
WHERE LOWER("directed by") LIKE LOWER('%Keith Gordon%') 
GROUP BY "no in season", title;
Results (two rows returned; each with row_count = 1):
- no in season: 1, title: Our Father
- no in season: 4, title: All in the Family

Conclusion:
- The data shows exactly 2 Season 3 episodes directed by Keith Gordon: “Our Father” (Episode 1) and “All in the Family” (Episode 4).

Assumptions:
- Interpreted the claim as “Keith Gordon directed 2 episodes of Dexter in Season 3.”
- The table public.dexter_season_3 fully represents Season 3 episodes and credits, and the “directed by” field lists the director by full name.
