Claim interpreted: “Colton’s Crossing Bridge is a Pratt through truss in Adams County.”

Data sources explored
- Database discovered: TabFact
- Schema: public
- Table: public.my_info_table (columns: name text, listed text, location text, county text, type text)

Evidence from database queries
1) Locate any record matching Colton’s Crossing Bridge (broad search)
SQL:
SELECT name, type, county FROM public.my_info_table WHERE LOWER(name) LIKE '%colton%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%crossing%' OR LOWER(name) LIKE '%bridge%';
Key matching row returned:
- name: colton 's crossing bridge; type: pratt through truss; county: ransom

2) Retrieve the exact record for Colton’s Crossing Bridge
SQL:
SELECT * FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name = 'colton ''s crossing bridge';
Result:
- Name: colton 's crossing bridge
- Listed: 1997 - 02 - 27
- Location: lisbon
- County: ransom
- Type: pratt through truss

3) Check for any record containing “colton” in Adams County
SQL:
SELECT name, county FROM public.my_info_table WHERE name ILIKE '%colton%' AND county = 'adams';
Result: No rows

Assessment of the claim
- Type: Supported. The record shows “pratt through truss.”
- County: Not supported. The record shows county = “ransom,” not “adams.” No record exists with a name containing “colton” in Adams County in this dataset.

Conclusion: The bridge is a Pratt through truss, but it is in Ransom County (location: Lisbon), not Adams County.

Assumptions and interpretation
- Interpreted “adam county” as “Adams County.”
- Interpreted “pratt through truss” as the bridge’s structural “type” field.
- Name matching allowed for punctuation and case variations; the exact stored name is “colton 's crossing bridge.”
