Claim interpreted: “Ilir Meta is the first person since Aleksandër Meksi to be elected as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania.”

Data sources discovered
- Database: TabFact
- Table: list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania

Schema (from discovery)
- Columns: name (text), born - died (text), term start (text), term end (text), political party (text)

Evidence
1) Ilir Meta’s party and term
- Result: Ilir Meta served 29 October 1999 – 22 February 2002; political party: Socialist Party of Albania.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "name", "born - died", "term start", "term end", "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" = 'Ilir Meta';

2) Aleksandër Meksi’s party and term
- Result: Aleksandër Meksi served 13 April 1992 – 11 March 1997; political party: Democratic Party of Albania.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT * FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE name = 'aleksandër meksi';

3) Prime ministers from the Democratic Party of Albania (to see who came after Meksi)
- Result: 
  - Aleksandër Meksi — 13 April 1992 to 11 March 1997
  - Sali Berisha — 11 September 2005 to 15 September 2013
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT name, "term start", "term end" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "political party" = 'Democratic Party of Albania';

4) Check if Ilir Meta is ever listed as Democratic Party of Albania
- Result: Ilir Meta is listed with political party “Socialist Party of Albania,” not “Democratic Party of Albania.”
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT "name", "political party" FROM list_of_prime_ministers_of_albania WHERE "name" = 'ilir meta';

Assessment
- The data shows Ilir Meta belonged to the Socialist Party of Albania, not the Democratic Party of Albania.
- After Aleksandër Meksi (DP), another DP prime minister (Sali Berisha) served from 2005 to 2013. Therefore, even if the claim intended that Ilir Meta was the first DP prime minister since Meksi, it is contradicted by the data.

Conclusion: The claim is not supported by the evidence.

Assumptions
- Interpreted “be elect as a member of the Democratic Party of Albania” as referring to party affiliation of Albanian prime ministers, as captured by the “political party” field in the available dataset.
