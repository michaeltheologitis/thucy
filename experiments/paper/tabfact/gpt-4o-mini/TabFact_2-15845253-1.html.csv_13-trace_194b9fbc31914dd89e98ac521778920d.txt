Claim to verify
"13 viral family have an helical virion shape."

Data source discovery
- Available database: public
- Table: viral_disease
- Columns: family (text), baltimore group (text), envelopment (text), virion shape (text), replication site (text)

Evidence
1) Distinct virion shape values and counts
SQL executed:
SELECT "virion shape", COUNT(*) AS count
FROM public.viral_disease
GROUP BY "virion shape"
ORDER BY count DESC;
Result:
- icosahedral: 13
- helical: 6
- complex: 2
- spherical: 1
- helical , bullet shaped: 1

2) Count of distinct families whose virion shape contains "helical"
SQL executed:
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT family) AS distinct_family_count 
FROM public.viral_disease 
WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%helical%';
Result: 7

3) List of distinct families with virion shape containing "helical"
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT family 
FROM public.viral_disease 
WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%helical%';
Result:
- arenaviridae
- bunyaviridae
- coronaviridae
- filoviridae
- orthomyxoviridae
- paramyxoviridae
- rhabdoviridae

4) Families and exact virion shape values for verification
SQL executed:
SELECT family, "virion shape" 
FROM public.viral_disease 
WHERE "virion shape" ILIKE '%helical%'
ORDER BY family;
Result:
- Arenaviridae: helical
- Bunyaviridae: helical
- Coronaviridae: helical
- Filoviridae: helical
- Orthomyxoviridae: helical
- Paramyxoviridae: helical
- Rhabdoviridae: helical , bullet shaped

Conclusion
Based on the public.viral_disease dataset, 7 virus families have a virion shape that includes the term "helical" (including one labeled "helical , bullet shaped"). This contradicts the claim that 13 viral families have a helical virion shape.

Assumptions
- Each row in public.viral_disease represents one virus family.
- "Helical" classification is taken directly from the "virion shape" column; entries containing the substring "helical" (case-insensitive) are considered helical, including the specific label "helical , bullet shaped".
