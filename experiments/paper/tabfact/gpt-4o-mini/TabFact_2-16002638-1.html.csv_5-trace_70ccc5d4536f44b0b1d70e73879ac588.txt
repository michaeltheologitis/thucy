Claim to verify: "the hurricane only win 50% of their game in 2007 and do not get promote to a higher division"

Data sources explored
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database with a table public.dundee_hurricanes containing season outcomes for the Dundee Hurricanes (season, division, wins, losses, ties, final position, notes).

Evidence
1) Dundee Hurricanes 2007 season record
- Executed SQL:
SELECT wins, losses, ties, (wins + losses + ties) AS total_games, 
    (wins::decimal / (wins + losses + ties)) * 100 AS win_percentage, 
    division, "final position", notes 
FROM dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE season = 2007;
- Result:
  • Wins: 9
  • Losses: 1
  • Ties: 0
  • Total Games: 10
  • Win Percentage: 90.00%
  • Division: BAF League Division 2 North
  • Final Position: 1 / 6
  • Notes: Promoted to Division 1 North.

2) Context around 2007 (seasons 2006–2008)
- Executed SQL:
SELECT season, division, wins, losses, ties, "final position", notes 
FROM dundee_hurricanes 
WHERE season BETWEEN 2006 AND 2008;
- Result:
  • 2006: Division = bafl division 2 scottish; Wins–Losses–Ties = 3–4–0; Final Position = 2/3; Notes = -
  • 2007: Division = bafl division 2 north; Wins–Losses–Ties = 9–1–0; Final Position = 1/6; Notes = promoted to division 1 north
  • 2008: Division = bafl division 1 north; Wins–Losses–Ties = 5–2–3; Final Position = 3/6; Notes = -

Assessment
- Win rate in 2007: 9 wins out of 10 games = 90%, not 50%.
- Promotion: Notes explicitly state “Promoted to Division 1 North,” and the subsequent 2008 season shows the team in Division 1 North, confirming promotion to a higher division.

Conclusion
- The claim is contradicted by the data: the Dundee Hurricanes won 90% of their games in 2007 and were promoted to a higher division afterward.

Assumptions
- “the hurricane” refers to the Dundee Hurricanes (British American football team).
- “promote to a higher division” refers to moving from BAFL Division 2 to Division 1, as indicated by the notes and the 2008 division listing.
