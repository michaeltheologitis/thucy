Claim interpreted: “Álvaro Campos is the goalkeeper for a team that has no match/entry with an average higher than 0.61.” I interpret “average” as the column named average in the available dataset and “match” as referring to entries/rows for that team in this table.

Data source discovered
- PostgreSQL database with one relevant table: public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b (columns: goalkeeper text, goals bigint, matches bigint, average double precision, team text).

Step 1: Confirm presence of Álvaro Campos and identify his team
SQL executed:
SELECT column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_schema = 'public' AND table_name = 't_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b';
Result: Columns are goalkeeper (text), goals (bigint), matches (bigint), average (double precision), team (text).

SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(goalkeeper) = LOWER('Álvaro Campos');
Result:
- goalkeeper: álvaro campos; goals: 24; matches: 28; average: 0.86; team: real murcia b

Confirmation via pattern search (handling accent):
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(goalkeeper) LIKE '%lvaro campos%';
Result:
- goalkeeper: álvaro campos; goals: 24; matches: 28; average: 0.86; team: real murcia b

Step 2: Check whether his team has any entry with average > 0.61
SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE team = 'real murcia b' AND average > 0.61;
Result:
- goalkeeper: álvaro campos; goals: 24; matches: 28; average: 0.86; team: real murcia b

Case-insensitive confirmation of team existence and rows
SQL executed:
SELECT EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(team) = LOWER('Real Murcia B')) AS team_exists;
Result: true

SQL executed:
SELECT * FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b WHERE LOWER(team) = LOWER('Real Murcia B');
Result:
- goalkeeper: álvaro campos; goals: 24; matches: 28; average: 0.86; team: real murcia b

Step 3 (context check): Teams with no entry above 0.61
SQL executed:
SELECT team FROM public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b GROUP BY team HAVING MAX(average) <= 0.61;
Result: Atlético Ciudad only (Real Murcia B is not in this list).

Findings
- True: There is a goalkeeper named Álvaro Campos in the dataset, and he plays for Real Murcia B.
- False: The team has no entry with average > 0.61. Evidence shows his own row for Real Murcia B has average = 0.86 (> 0.61), so the team does have at least one entry above 0.61.

Conclusion
The claim that Álvaro Campos is the goalkeeper for a team that has no match/entry with an average higher than 0.61 is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “average” refers to the average column in public.t_2008_09_segunda_divisi_n_b.
- “no match” is interpreted as “no row/entry in this dataset” for that team with average > 0.61.
- Name matching was done case-insensitively and accommodating diacritics (e.g., using '%lvaro campos%' to capture 'Álvaro').
