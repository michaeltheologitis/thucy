Claim interpreted: The user asserts that Glenn Capriola was selected with the 24th pick in the 9th round (implicitly of the NFL Draft).

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database containing a single table: public.indianapolis_colts_draft_history (Indianapolis Colts draft history).
- Table schema (columns): round (bigint), pick (bigint), overall (bigint), name (text), position (text), college (text).

Evidence from data (with executed SQL):
1) Initial exact-name lookup (no rows returned):
SQL:
SELECT round, pick, overall, position, college 
FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history 
WHERE name = 'Glenn Capriola';

2) Fuzzy name search confirms record:
SQL:
SELECT name, round, pick, overall, position, college 
FROM indianapolis_colts_draft_history 
WHERE name ILIKE '%Capriola%';

Result:
- Name: Glenn Capriola
- Round: 9
- Pick: 24 (within round)
- Overall: 247
- Position: Running Back
- College: Boston College

Assessment:
- The database record shows Glenn Capriola was drafted in Round 9 with Pick 24. This directly supports the claim that he was selected with the 24th pick in the 9th round. No contradictions found.

Assumptions:
- The claim pertains to the Indianapolis Colts’ NFL Draft history (the available authoritative data source).
- “Pick” refers to the pick number within the round (distinct from the overall pick), consistent with the table’s columns.
