Summary
- Claim: “episode 4 be see by 2.24 million people in the US.”
- Interpreted against the available authoritative dataset (Smallville Season 9). The data shows Episode 4 had 2.61 million US viewers, not 2.24 million.

Data source discovery
- Available database: schema public
- Table: public.smallville_season_9
- Columns: no (bigint); - (bigint); title (text); directed by (text); written by (text); us air date (text); production code (text); us viewers (million) (double precision)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Retrieve US viewers for Episode 4 (season episode number = 4)
- SQL: SELECT "us viewers (million)" FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "-" = 4;
- Result: 2.61 million

2) Retrieve full record for Episode 4
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.smallville_season_9 WHERE "-" = 4;
- Result: Title: Echo; Directed by: Wayne Rose; Written by: Bryan Miller; US Air Date: October 16, 2009; Production Code: 3x5254; US Viewers: 2.61 million

Conclusion
- The claim that episode 4 was seen by 2.24 million people in the US is not supported by the data. The authoritative dataset shows 2.61 million viewers for Episode 4.

Assumptions
- “Episode 4” is interpreted as Season 9, Episode 4 of Smallville, because that is the only dataset available.
- “be see by … in the US” is interpreted as the US viewers (millions) field in the dataset.
