Summary
- Claim: “On April 10 the Chicago Black Hawk vs Detroit Red Wing’s record be 1-1.”
- Finding: In the only available authoritative dataset (1965–66 Chicago Black Hawks season), there is no game recorded on April 10, so the claim is not supported by the data.

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season (PostgreSQL)
- Table schema (from schema inspection):
  - date (text)
  - visitor (text)
  - score (text)
  - home (text)
  - record (text)

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for a Chicago vs Detroit game on April 10, 1966
- Purpose: Verify if the Chicago Black Hawks played the Detroit Red Wings on 1966-04-10 and if any result could be “1-1”.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
  FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season
  WHERE (visitor ILIKE '%Detroit Red Wings%' OR home ILIKE '%Detroit Red Wings%')
    AND date LIKE '1966-04-10';
- Result: No rows returned.

2) Check for any Chicago game on April 10 within the 1965–66 season
- Purpose: Confirm whether Chicago has any game recorded on that calendar day in this dataset.
- Executed SQL:
  SELECT date, visitor, score, home, record
  FROM public.t_1965_66_chicago_black_hawks_season
  WHERE date LIKE '%-04-10';
- Result: No rows returned.

Conclusion
- Within the available authoritative dataset (1965–66 season), there is no recorded game on April 10—therefore no basis for a 1–1 result or record on that date versus the Detroit Red Wings. The claim is not supported by the data at hand.

Assumptions
- The claim’s date (“April 10”) was interpreted within the scope of the only accessible dataset (1965–66 season). If the claim refers to a different season, that data is not available in the current data source.
- “Record be 1–1” was interpreted as the game score between the two teams on that date.
