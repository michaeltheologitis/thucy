Claim interpreted: Within the available dataset (1996 PGA Championship), is Nick Price the only player from Zimbabwe?

Data source discovered
- Available database: PostgreSQL with table public.t_1996_pga_championship (1996 PGA Championship data).

Schema check
- SQL executed:
  SELECT column_name, data_type 
  FROM information_schema.columns 
  WHERE table_name = 't_1996_pga_championship' AND table_schema = 'public';
- Result (abridged): place (text), player (text), country (text), score (text), "to par" (text), money (bigint)

Evidence 1: Count players from Zimbabwe
- SQL executed:
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%Zimbabwe%';
- Result:
  count = 1

Evidence 2: List players from Zimbabwe
- SQL executed:
  SELECT player, country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE country ILIKE '%Zimbabwe%' ORDER BY player;
- Result:
  player = nick price, country = zimbabwe

Evidence 3: Verify Nick Price’s recorded country
- SQL executed:
  SELECT DISTINCT country FROM public.t_1996_pga_championship WHERE player ILIKE '%Nick Price%';
- Result:
  country = zimbabwe

Conclusion
- In the 1996 PGA Championship dataset, there is exactly one entry with country Zimbabwe, and it is Nick Price. Therefore, within this dataset, Nick Price is the only player from Zimbabwe.

Assumptions
- Because the only accessible dataset is the 1996 PGA Championship table, the claim is interpreted as referring to that event’s field. This does not generalize to all tournaments or all sports.
