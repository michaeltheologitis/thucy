Step 1: Discover available data
- Result: A PostgreSQL database is accessible with a table in the public schema named dexter_season_3.
- SQL evidence:
  SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';

Step 2: Inspect the table structure
- Columns found in public.dexter_season_3:
  - no in series (bigint)
  - no in season (bigint)
  - title (text)
  - directed by (text)
  - written by (text)
  - original air date (text)
  - us viewers (millions) (text)
- SQL evidence:
  SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns WHERE table_name = 'dexter_season_3' AND table_schema = 'public';

Step 3: Count the number of episodes (rows)
- Result: 10 episodes (rows) in dexter_season_3.
- SQL evidence:
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count FROM public.dexter_season_3;

Step 4: Review episode numbering to check completeness
- no in season values present: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11 (note: 9 and 12 are not present in this dataset)
- SQL evidence:
  SELECT "no in season" FROM public.dexter_season_3 ORDER BY "no in season" ASC;

Assessment relative to the claim
- Claim: “the tv series dexter have more than a dozen episode in its third season.”
- Interpretation: “more than a dozen” means strictly greater than 12 episodes.
- Data shows 10 episodes for season 3 in the available dataset. This is not more than 12.
- Therefore, the claim is contradicted by the data.

Assumptions
- “Dozen” is interpreted as 12; “more than a dozen” means >12.
- Each row in public.dexter_season_3 represents one episode of Dexter’s third season.
