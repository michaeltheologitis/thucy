Claim: Proteus mirabilis has a negative Voges–Proskauer (VP) result.

Data sources explored:
- Discovered a PostgreSQL database named imvic in the public schema containing IMViC biochemical test results.

Schema summary (from imvic.public.imvic):
- Columns: species (text), indole (text), methyl red (text), voges - proskauer (text), citrate (text)
- No primary or foreign keys; standalone lookup table of IMViC results.

Evidence:
1) Query to directly retrieve VP result for Proteus mirabilis
- SQL: SELECT species, "voges - proskauer" FROM public.imvic WHERE species ILIKE '%Proteus mirabilis%'
- Result: species = proteus mirabilis; voges - proskauer = negative

2) Query to retrieve full IMViC profile for exact species name
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.imvic WHERE species ILIKE 'Proteus mirabilis';
- Result (as returned by the tool):
  - Indole: negative
  - Methyl Red: positive
  - Voges–Proskauer: negative
  - Citrate: positive

Assessment:
- The imvic table records Proteus mirabilis as “negative” for the Voges–Proskauer test, which directly supports the claim.

Conclusion:
- The claim is supported by the data.

Assumptions:
- Species matching was done case-insensitively; 'Proteus mirabilis' refers to the canonical species entry in the imvic table.
- “negative” denotes a negative test outcome for the VP test in this dataset.
