Scope and data source
- Verified against the available PostgreSQL database: public schema, table: list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (columns: no, football club, continent, associated football club, seasons, racing drivers).

Key evidence from executed SQL
1) Which rows mention Brazil, and what continent are they in?
SQL:
SELECT "football club", "associated football club", continent 
FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs 
WHERE "football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%' OR "associated football club" ILIKE '%Brazil%';
Result:
- football club: Team Brazil; associated football club: none; continent: South America

2) How many entries exist per continent?
SQL:
SELECT continent, COUNT(*) AS row_count FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs GROUP BY continent;
Result:
- Oceania: 2
- South America: 1
- Europe: 9
- Asia: 2

3) List all football clubs by continent
SQL:
SELECT "football club", "continent" FROM public.list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs ORDER BY "continent";
Excerpt of result (grouped by continent):
- Asia: Team Japan; Beijing Guoan
- Europe: Team Luxembourg; RSC Anderlecht; Team Netherlands; FC Basel 1893; Team England; AC Sparta Prague; Rangers FC; FC Midtjylland; AC Milan
- Oceania: Team New Zealand; Team Australia
- South America: Team Brazil

Assessment
- The dataset contains exactly one entry with continent = South America, and it is “Team Brazil.”
- Therefore, within this dataset, Team Brazil is the only club located in South America.

Conclusion
- The claim is supported by the available data in the referenced table.

Assumptions
- “Football club” refers to entries in the table list_of_superleague_formula_football_clubs (which catalogs Superleague Formula-branded football clubs) rather than all football clubs worldwide.
- The continent field in the table accurately reflects each entry’s continent.
- “Team Brazil” in the user claim corresponds to the row "Team Brazil" in the table.
