Claim to verify: “1 - 0 be the score when the home team be wimbledon.”

Data sources discovered
- PostgreSQL database (TabFact) with a single relevant table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup (FA Cup 1990–91 season).

Schema details (from the database)
- Table: public.t_1990_91_fa_cup
  - Columns: "tie no" (text), "home team" (text), "score" (text), "away team" (text), "date" (text)
  - Score is stored as text; home/away team names are text.

Evidence and executed SQL
1) Check for any match where the home team is exactly Wimbledon
- SQL: SELECT "home team", "score", "away team", "date" FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE "home team" = 'Wimbledon';
- Result: No records returned.

2) Check case-insensitively for any home team containing “Wimbledon”
- SQL: SELECT * FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%wimbledon%';
- Result: No records returned.

3) Check for any match involving Wimbledon (either home or away) to understand context
- SQL: SELECT "home team", score, "away team", date FROM public.t_1990_91_fa_cup WHERE LOWER("home team") LIKE '%wimbledon%' OR LOWER("away team") LIKE '%wimbledon%';
- Result: 1 match found — Home Team: Shrewsbury Town; Score: 1 - 0; Away Team: Wimbledon; Date: 26/01/1991.

Assessment
- Within the available FA Cup 1990–91 data, there are no matches where Wimbledon is the home team, so the statement that “1 - 0” is the score when the home team is Wimbledon is not supported. The only Wimbledon-related match found has Wimbledon as the away team in a 1 - 0 loss at Shrewsbury Town.

Conclusion
- The claim is not supported by the data in this dataset.

Assumptions made
- Interpreted the claim as referring to the FA Cup 1990–91 dataset available in the database and the phrase “be” as “is.” No other seasons or competitions were accessible in the current data environment.
