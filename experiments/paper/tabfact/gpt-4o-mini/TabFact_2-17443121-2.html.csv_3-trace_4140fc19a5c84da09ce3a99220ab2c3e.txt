Claim interpreted: In Season 1 of the TV show “Gary Unmarried,” there are 4 episode titles that include both the names “Gary” and “Allison.”

Finding: Verified by querying the available gary_unmarried episode dataset. There are exactly 4 such episodes in Season 1.

Episodes featuring both “Gary” and “Allison” (with air dates):
- gary and allison 's restaurant — November 12, 2008
- gary and allison brooks — November 19, 2008
- gary hooks up allison — March 18, 2009
- gary fixes allison 's garbage disposal — May 20, 2009

Why this is Season 1: The dataset contains 20 episodes dated in 2008–2009 (the 2008–2009 broadcast season for Season 1), with no later dates.

Executed SQL evidence:
1) List all rows (to inspect titles and dates)
SELECT episode, "air date" FROM public.gary_unmarried;

2) Count and list episodes whose titles contain both “gary” and “allison” (case-insensitive)
SELECT COUNT(*) AS episode_count, array_agg(episode) AS episode_titles, array_agg("air date") AS air_dates 
FROM gary_unmarried 
WHERE LOWER(episode) LIKE '%gary%' AND LOWER(episode) LIKE '%allison%';

Result returned: episode_count = 4; episode_titles/air_dates correspond to the four episodes listed above.

3) Confirm season timeframe by extracting year from air dates and counting episodes per year
SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM "air date"::date) AS year, COUNT(*) AS episode_count
FROM public.gary_unmarried
WHERE "air date" IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY year
ORDER BY year;

Result returned: 2008: 11 episodes; 2009: 9 episodes (total 20), consistent with Season 1.

Conclusion: The dataset shows exactly four Season 1 episode titles that include both “Gary” and “Allison.”

Assumptions made:
- “Feature the name of both gary and allison” means the episode title text contains both substrings “gary” and “allison,” case-insensitive.
- The gary_unmarried table represents Season 1 episodes, which is supported by the 2008–2009 air dates in the data.
