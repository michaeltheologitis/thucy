Claim to verify: “Ecurie Espadon is the entrant when Talbot - Lago is the constructor and Talbot - Lago T26C is the chassis.”

Data sources explored
- Discovered data source: public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix (1950 Swiss Grand Prix dataset)
- Table schema (from schema inspection): columns = driver (text), entrant (text), constructor (text), chassis (text), engine (text), tyre (text); no primary key or additional constraints.

Evidence from the data
1) What entrants are recorded for Talbot - Lago T26C?
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, entrant, constructor FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE chassis = 'talbot - lago t26c';
Result highlights:
- Driver: Johnny Claes, Entrant: Ecurie Belge, Constructor: Talbot - Lago
- Driver: Philippe Étancelin, Entrant: Private, Constructor: Talbot - Lago
- Driver: Harry Schell, Entrant: Ecurie Bleue, Constructor: Talbot - Lago
Interpretation: For chassis “talbot - lago t26c” with constructor “talbot - lago”, the entrants are Ecurie Belge, Private, and Ecurie Bleue — not Ecurie Espadon.

2) Where does Ecurie Espadon appear as an entrant in this dataset?
SQL executed:
SELECT driver, constructor, chassis, engine FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix WHERE entrant = 'ecurie espadon';
Result highlight:
- Driver: rudi fischer; Constructor: sva - fiat; Chassis: sva 1500; Engine: fiat l4s
Interpretation: Ecurie Espadon is present, but associated with SVA-Fiat (chassis “sva 1500”), not Talbot - Lago T26C.

3) Distinct chassis/constructor/entrant combinations (context check)
SQL executed:
SELECT DISTINCT chassis, constructor, entrant FROM public.t_1950_swiss_grand_prix ORDER BY chassis;
Relevant lines include:
- sva 1500, sva - fiat, ecurie espadon
- talbot - lago t26c, talbot - lago, ecurie belge/private/ecurie bleue
Interpretation: Confirms that Talbot - Lago T26C entries are tied to Ecurie Belge, Private, and Ecurie Bleue; Ecurie Espadon is tied to SVA-Fiat instead.

Conclusion
- The dataset shows no instance where the entrant is Ecurie Espadon for a Talbot - Lago T26C chassis with Talbot - Lago as constructor. Therefore, the claim is not supported by the data.

Assumptions
- “albot - lago t26c” in the claim is interpreted as “talbot - lago t26c.”
- Verification scope is limited to the available dataset (1950 Swiss Grand Prix).
